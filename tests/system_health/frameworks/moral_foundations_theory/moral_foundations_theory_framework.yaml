description: |
  Simplified test version of Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory framework 
  for system health testing and validation. This version matches the main MFT 
  framework structure but is optimized for testing scenarios.
  
  ## Test Framework Purpose
  
  This framework is specifically designed for:
  - System health monitoring and validation
  - Pipeline testing with known expected outputs
  - Framework compatibility verification
  - Algorithm configuration testing
  
  ## Theoretical Foundation (Simplified)
  
  Based on Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory with six foundation pairs:
  1. **Care ↔ Harm**: Compassion vs cruelty
  2. **Fairness ↔ Cheating**: Justice vs exploitation  
  3. **Loyalty ↔ Betrayal**: Group commitment vs disloyalty
  4. **Authority ↔ Subversion**: Respect for order vs chaos
  5. **Sanctity ↔ Degradation**: Purity vs contamination
  6. **Liberty ↔ Oppression**: Freedom vs domination
