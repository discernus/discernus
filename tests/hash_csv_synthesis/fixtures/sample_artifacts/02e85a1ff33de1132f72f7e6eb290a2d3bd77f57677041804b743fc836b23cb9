The speech's core is a powerful assertion of universal human Dignity and an unwavering Hope for the global expansion of freedom. This idealistic mission is framed as the only effective response to the Fear generated by terrorism, which is itself attributed to Resentment and tyranny. The central tension lies between this grand, almost fantastical, ambition of 'ending tyranny in our world' and the more pragmatic acknowledgements of the difficulty of the task. The character's moral identity is that of a crusader for liberty, driven by a belief in America's divinely-inspired mission to spread its founding ideals as a matter of both moral imperative and national security.\",\n  \"document_analyses\": {\n    \"Bush_Inaugural_2005.txt\": {\n      \"worldview\": \"A neo-conservative, American exceptionalist worldview that sees the United States as having a moral and divinely-sanctioned duty to actively spread freedom and democracy globally, not only as an expression of its values but as the primary strategy for ensuring its own security in a post-9/11 world.\",\n      \"scores\": {\n        \"Dignity\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.9,\n          \"salience\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"Tribalism\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.2,\n          \"salience\": 0.2\n        },\n        \"Truth\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.7,\n          \"salience\": 0.6\n        },\n        \"Manipulation\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.1\n        },\n        \"Justice\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.8,\n          \"salience\": 0.8\n        },\n        \"Resentment\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.1,\n          \"salience\": 0.4\n        },\n        \"Hope\": {\n          \"intensity\": 1.0,\n          \"salience\": 1.0\n        },\n        \"Fear\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.5,\n          \"salience\": 0.8\n        },\n        \"Pragmatism\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.5,\n          \"salience\": 0.5\n        },\n        \"Fantasy\": {\n          \"intensity\": 0.6,\n          \"salience\": 0.8\n        }\n      },\n      \"evidence\": {\n        \"Dignity\": [\n          \"From the day of our founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this Earth has rights and dignity and matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker of heaven and Earth.\",\n          \"Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our Nation.

'Hope' and 'Dignity' receive maximum scores as the central, driving themes; the entire address is a hopeful proclamation of the universal right to freedom and dignity. 'Justice' is also high, framed as the natural outcome of liberty. The primary motivation for this mission is 'Fear' stemming from the 'day of fire' (9/11), which is presented as a salient, background threat that this hopeful mission will solve. The grand, sweeping goal of 'ending tyranny in our world' scores high on 'Fantasy' for its idealistic ambition, creating a notable tension with the more grounded, but less central, acknowledgements of 'Pragmatism'. 'Tribalism' and 'Manipulation' are scored very low, as the speech's rhetoric is explicitly universalist and direct rather than insular or deceptive. 'Resentment' is scored low in intensity but moderate in salience because it is identified as a key evil to be defeated, not a quality the speaker embodies.\",\n      \"salience_ranking\": [\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Dignity\",\n          \"salience_score\": 1.0,\n          \"rank\": 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Hope\",\n          \"salience_score\": 1.0,\n          \"rank\": 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Justice\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.8,\n          \"rank\": 3\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Fear\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.8,\n          \"rank\": 3\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Fantasy\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.8,\n          \"rank\": 3\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Truth\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.6,\n          \"rank\": 6\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Pragmatism\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.5,\n          \"rank\": 7\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Resentment\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.4,\n          \"rank\": 8\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Tribalism\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.2,\n          \"rank\": 9\n        },\n        {\n          \"dimension\": \"Manipulation\",\n          \"salience_score\": 0.1,\n          \"rank\": 10\n        }\n      ],\n      \"character_priorities\": \"The speaker's primary moral identity is that of a visionary crusader.
