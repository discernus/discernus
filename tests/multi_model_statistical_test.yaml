# Prompt guidance optimized for consistent responses
prompt_guidance:
  role_definition: |
    You are analyzing text for a statistical comparison study. Provide consistent, precise scoring.

  framework_summary_instructions: |
    Score the text against Fairness and Liberty anchors with high precision for statistical analysis.

  analysis_methodology: |
    1. Analyze conceptual strength of fairness and liberty themes
    2. Provide precise decimal scores for statistical comparison
    3. Be consistent in scoring methodology

  scoring_requirements: |
    - Use precise decimal values between 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g., 0.75, 0.83)
    - Provide scores for both Fairness and Liberty anchors
    - Maintain consistent scoring criteria

  json_format_instructions: |
    Return JSON with this exact structure:
    {
      "Fairness": {"score": 0.0-1.0, "evidence": "quote", "reasoning": "brief explanation"},
      "Liberty": {"score": 0.0-1.0, "evidence": "quote", "reasoning": "brief explanation"}
