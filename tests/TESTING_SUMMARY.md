# 🧪 Narrative Gravity Maps - Testing System Summary

## 📋 Overview

A comprehensive smoke testing system has been implemented for the Narrative Gravity Maps application, covering both CLI tools and the Streamlit interface. The testing system is designed to verify basic functionality and catch major regressions.

## 🎯 Test Results

**✅ ALL TESTS PASSING** (31 tests total, 2 skipped)

- **CLI Tools**: 17 tests ✅
- **Streamlit App**: 14 tests ✅ (2 skipped)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run All Tests
```bash
# Python runner
python tests/run_tests.py

# Shell wrapper
./tests/test.sh
```

### Run Specific Tests
```bash
# CLI tests only
./tests/test.sh cli

# Streamlit tests only
./tests/test.sh streamlit

# Quick syntax/import checks
./tests/test.sh quick
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

### CLI Tools (`test_cli_tools.py`)

#### Framework Manager Tests ✅
- Framework initialization and directory handling
- Framework listing (empty and populated states)
- Framework validation (basic smoke test)
- CLI command help and usage verification

#### Prompt Generator Tests ✅
- Configuration loading (dipoles.json, framework.json)
- Interactive prompt generation with proper structure
- Batch prompt generation
- CLI command help and usage verification

#### Visualization Engine Tests ✅
- Elliptical visualizer initialization
- Analysis data loading and validation
- JSON error handling
- CLI command help and usage verification

#### Integration Tests ✅
- CLI commands execute without crashing
- Help system functionality works
- Basic command validation passes

### Streamlit App (`test_streamlit_app.py`)

#### Component Tests ✅
- Framework name normalization
- JSON framework detection (with/without metadata)
- Utility function validation

#### Integration Tests ✅
- File existence checks (all required files present)
- Python syntax validation (no syntax errors)
- Import system verification (all dependencies available)
- Requirements file validation

#### App Startup Tests
- ✅ Launch script validation
- ✅ Dependencies verification
- ⚠️ Full Streamlit startup (skipped - long-running test)

## 🔧 Test Features

### Automated Setup
- Tests automatically set up Python path
- Working directory management
- Temporary test environments
- Resource cleanup after tests

### Mock Data Generation
- Creates realistic framework structures
- Generates test analysis data
- Isolated test directories
- No interference with main project

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing dependencies
- Timeout protection for subprocess calls
- Detailed error reporting
- Fallback behaviors for edge cases

## 📈 Test Results Details

### Successful Test Categories

1. **File Structure Validation** ✅
   - All required files exist
   - Python syntax is valid
   - No import errors

2. **CLI Tool Functionality** ✅
   - All CLI tools can be invoked
   - Help systems work correctly
   - Basic operations don't crash

3. **Framework System** ✅
   - Framework manager initializes
   - Configuration loading works
   - Prompt generation succeeds

4. **Streamlit Components** ✅
   - Utility functions work correctly
   - Framework detection logic works
   - Name normalization handles edge cases

### Skipped Tests

1. **Session State Initialization** (Streamlit)
   - Reason: Complex Streamlit session state mocking
   - Alternative: Tested via integration tests

2. **Full Streamlit Startup** 
   - Reason: Long-running test (5+ seconds)
   - Alternative: Can be enabled by removing `@unittest.skip`

## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Before committing changes
./tests/test.sh

# Quick validation during development
./tests/test.sh quick

# Test specific component after changes
./tests/test.sh cli
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# In CI pipeline
pip install -r tests/test_requirements.txt
python tests/run_tests.py
```

### Debugging Failed Tests
```bash
# Run individual test files for detailed output
python tests/test_cli_tools.py
python tests/test_streamlit_app.py
```

## 🎯 Test Philosophy

These are **smoke tests** designed to:
- ✅ Verify basic functionality works
- ✅ Catch major regressions quickly
- ✅ Ensure dependencies are properly installed
- ✅ Validate file structure and syntax
- ✅ Test CLI tools can be invoked
- ✅ Confirm Streamlit app can be imported

They are **NOT** designed to:
- ❌ Test complex business logic in detail
- ❌ Validate specific analysis accuracy
- ❌ Test all edge cases comprehensively
- ❌ Replace manual testing for new features

## 📝 Maintenance Notes

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow the existing test file structure
2. Use descriptive test names
3. Include proper setup/teardown
4. Add timeouts for subprocess calls
5. Update this summary when adding major test categories

### Test Dependencies
- Tests use the main `requirements.txt` plus additional testing packages
- Mock data is generated programmatically
- No external services or network dependencies
- All tests should be deterministic and fast

### Known Limitations
1. Framework validation test is basic (directory structure dependent)
2. Streamlit session state testing is limited
3. Some integration tests depend on file system state
4. Long-running tests are skipped by default

## 🎉 Success Metrics

The testing system successfully:
- **Validates** all core CLI functionality
- **Verifies** Streamlit app can be imported and basic functions work
- **Checks** all required files exist and have valid syntax
- **Confirms** dependencies are properly installed
- **Provides** fast feedback (< 2 seconds for full test suite)
- **Offers** multiple ways to run tests (Python, shell script)
- **Includes** comprehensive documentation and examples

This testing foundation provides confidence that basic functionality works and serves as a safety net for future development.
