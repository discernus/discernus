# Minimal Test Framework

## Abstract

**What is this framework?** This is a minimal test framework designed to validate the research directions generation functionality.

**What problem does it solve?** It addresses the need for a simple, valid framework to test the enhanced validation system.

**Who is it for?** This framework is for testing and validation purposes.

## Theoretical & Empirical Foundations

This framework is based on basic validation principles and serves as a test case for the enhanced framework validator.

## Analytical Methodology

The framework uses a simple scoring approach across two dimensions.

## Intended Application & Corpus Fit

This framework is designed for testing purposes only.

        Analyze the provided text using this framework.
        
        For each dimension, provide:
        - **Score (0.0-1.0)**: Based on evidence
        - **Evidence**: Supporting text
        
        Focus on identifying strengths and areas for improvement.
