# Framework Researcher: Enhanced Validation Integration

**Purpose**: Comprehensive framework validation combining structural compliance, academic grounding, and research synthesis using DiscernusLibrarian methodology.

## üéØ Raison d'√ätre

**Why This Tool Exists**: Structural validation alone is insufficient for production frameworks. Researchers need **academic grounding and research synthesis** to ensure frameworks are theoretically sound, methodologically robust, and aligned with current literature. This tool provides the missing academic validation layer that transforms basic compliance into scholarly excellence.

**The Problem It Solves**: 
- Frameworks can pass structural validation while remaining theoretically weak
- Researchers lack systematic access to academic literature for framework validation
- Validation outputs are scattered and difficult to track over time
- No integration between structural compliance and academic rigor

**The Solution**: A comprehensive validation system that combines canonical structural validation with LLM-based academic assessment, DiscernusLibrarian integration for systematic literature reviews, and organized output management that keeps validation history alongside frameworks.

This directory contains the enhanced framework validation system that combines:

1. **Structural Validation** (imported from `framework_validation/framework_validator.py`)
   - Framework specification compliance
   - Internal coherence and consistency
   - Output schema validation

2. **Academic Validation** (LLM-based assessment)
   - Theoretical foundation assessment
   - Literature support analysis
   - Research gap identification
   - Methodological validation

3. **Research Directions Generation**
   - Priority research questions identification
   - Systematic literature review orchestration
   - Academic grounding validation

4. **Integrated Assessment**
   - Combined scoring (60% structural + 40% academic)
   - Comprehensive recommendations
   - Enhanced validation reports with full research synthesis

## üìÅ Files

- **`enhanced_framework_validator.py`**: Main enhanced validation tool
- **`test_enhanced_framework_validator.py`**: Unit tests for the validator
- **`test_report_generation.py`**: Test script for report generation
- **`README.md`**: This documentation

**Note**: The enhanced validator now imports the canonical `FrameworkValidator` from `scripts/framework_validation/` and `DiscernusLibrarian` from `discernus/librarian/` rather than duplicating code.

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Enhanced Validation
```bash
python3 scripts/framework_researcher/enhanced_framework_validator.py frameworks/reference/flagship/pdaf_v10/pdaf_v10.md
```

### Structural Validation Only
```bash
python3 scripts/framework_researcher/enhanced_framework_validator.py frameworks/reference/flagship/pdaf_v10/pdaf_v10.md --no-academic
```

### Save Report to File
```bash
python3 scripts/framework_researcher/enhanced_framework_validator.py frameworks/reference/flagship/pdaf_v10/pdaf_v10.md --output enhanced_validation_2025-08-21.md
```

**Note**: Reports are now automatically saved to the framework's `validation_reports/` directory with framework name prefixes for discoverability.

### Verbose Mode with Full Transparency
```bash
# Command line verbose mode
python3 scripts/framework_researcher/enhanced_framework_validator.py frameworks/reference/flagship/pdaf_v10.md --verbose

### What You Get

The enhanced integration now provides **complete transparency** by embedding all detailed research reports directly into the final synthesis. Instead of just getting a summary with file paths, you receive:

1. **Executive Summary**: High-level findings and recommendations
2. **Research Synthesis**: Detailed analysis and actionable insights
3. **Detailed Research Appendices**: File references and content descriptions
4. **Complete Research Reports**: Full, unedited detailed reports embedded as appendices

### New Directory Structure

All validation artifacts are now organized alongside the frameworks they assess:

```
frameworks/reference/flagship/pdaf_v10/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pdaf_v10.md                           # The framework itself
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validation_reports/                    # All validation outputs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pdaf_v10_enhanced_validation_*.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pdaf_v10_research_synthesis_*.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ research_directions/                   # Research questions

  - Initial research discovery
  - Counter-evidence and alternative perspectives
  - Literature completeness validation
- **Phase 3**: Research synthesis and evidence integration
- **Phase 4**: Enhanced red team validation and fact-checking

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {framework_name}.md                    # The framework file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validation_reports/                     # All validation outputs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {framework_name}_enhanced_validation_*.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {framework_name}_research_synthesis_*.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ research_directions/                    # Research questions
