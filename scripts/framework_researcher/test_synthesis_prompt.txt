You are tasked with creating a comprehensive synthesis report from research findings on a populist discourse analysis framework.

CONTEXT:
The Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.0 is a comprehensive analytical tool designed to identify, measure, and analyze the core rhetorical components of populist political communication through advanced strategic tension analysis and salience-weighted measurement.

RESEARCH FINDINGS TO SYNTHESIZE:

1. **Research Question 1**: Validating the Conceptualization and Measurement of "Strategic Tension"
   - The framework's central innovation is "Populist Strategic Tension" analysis
   - Formula: Tension = min(Anchor_A_score, Anchor_B_score) Ã— |Anchor_A_salience - Anchor_B_salience|
   - This may not accurately capture psychological effects of contradictory messages
   - Need theoretical grounding in communication theory and cognitive dissonance research

2. **Research Question 2**: Ensuring Cross-Ideological Validity in Boundary Construction
   - Framework claims to be cross-ideological but may inadequately measure left-wing populism
   - "Boundary Distinction Anchors" category consists of "Nationalist Exclusion" and "Economic Populist Appeals"
   - Left-wing populists construct boundaries around class, anti-imperialism, anti-globalization
   - Need more comprehensive boundary-drawing mechanisms

3. **Research Question 3**: Refining the Theoretical Basis of Salience-Weighted Measurement
   - Framework separates populist intensity from salience (important advance)
   - Current operationalization uses simple weighted average
   - Communication research suggests more complex relationships
   - Need to understand interplay between message extremity and rhetorical emphasis

TASK:
Create a coherent synthesis report that:
1. Summarizes the key research findings
2. Identifies common themes and patterns
3. Provides actionable recommendations for framework improvement
4. Maintains academic rigor and clarity

Format the report in clear sections with proper headings and structure.
