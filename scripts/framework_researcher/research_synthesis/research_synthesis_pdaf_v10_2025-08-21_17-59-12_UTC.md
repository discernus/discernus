**Framework**: pdaf_v10
**Research Questions**: 3 completed

## Research Summary

### Priority 1: How does the strategic interplay between contradictory populist appeals, as operationalized by the PDAF's "Populist Strategic Tension," influence audience perception, persuasion, and affective responses?
**Rationale**: The framework's core innovation, "Populist Strategic Tension Mathematics," rests on the central assumption that contradictory appeals may "confuse audiences or undermine populist effectiveness." While theoretically plausible, this is a significant empirical claim about audience reception. The specific formula `Tension = min(Anchor_A_score, Anchor_B_score) × |Anchor_A_salience - Anchor_B_salience|` is a hypothesis about how this psychological effect occurs—that tension is highest when two contradictory ideas are present, but one is much more salient than the other. This needs to be grounded in political psychology and communication research.
**Expected Outcomes**:
-   **Validation or Refinement of the Tension Formula**: The literature may support the current formula, suggest modifications (e.g., a multiplicative effect of scores, a different role for salience), or identify specific pairs of anchors where tension is more or less impactful.
-   **Identification of Audience-Specific Effects**: Research may indicate that "strategic tension" is not universally negative. It might be an effective strategy of "strategic ambiguity" that allows different segments of an audience to hear what they want to hear, a concept known in political communication.
-   **Stronger Theoretical Justification**: Grounding this metric in reception studies would move it from a plausible construct to an empirically-informed measure of a documented communication phenomenon.
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Summary**: Research completed but no summary available

### Priority 2: To what extent does the academic literature on populist communication and mobilization support the PDAF's tri-categorical structure (Core, Mechanism, Boundary), and how does it inform the theoretical relationships *between* these dimensions?
**Rationale**: The framework organizes nine well-established populist dimensions into three functional categories. This structure implies a theoretical model where "Core Anchors" are fundamental, "Mechanism Anchors" are instrumental tools for mobilization, and "Boundary Anchors" define the populist community. While intuitive, this hierarchical or functional distinction is a significant theoretical choice. Other scholars might classify these dimensions differently (e.g., is "Homogeneous People Construction" a core feature or a mechanism?). A thorough literature review is needed to justify this specific categorization over alternatives.
**Expected Outcomes**:
-   **A Robust Defense of the Categorization**: The review could uncover strong theoretical support for this Core/Mechanism/Boundary model from democratic theory, political sociology, or mobilization studies.
-   **Refinement of the Dimensional Groupings**: The literature may suggest that certain dimensions belong in different categories or that the categories themselves should be redefined. For example, is "Anti-Pluralist Exclusion" truly a core feature on par with people-elite framing, or is it a consequence or mechanism of it?
-   **A Clearer Theory of Populist Discourse**: This research would help articulate *how* the dimensions are theorized to work together—for example, that "Mechanisms" are deployed to activate the "Core" beliefs, which are then given substance through "Boundary" drawing.
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Summary**: Research completed but no summary available

### Priority 3: Beyond "Nationalist Exclusion" and "Economic Populist Appeals," what other key discursive mechanisms do populists use to construct in-group/out-group boundaries, and how do these mechanisms vary across left-wing and right-wing populist ideologies?
**Rationale**: The "Boundary Distinction Anchors" category is currently limited to nationalism and economics. While crucial, this may oversimplify how populist boundaries are drawn, especially in a framework aiming for "cross-ideological" applicability. Left-wing populists might emphasize class-based or anti-imperialist boundaries, while other populists may use religious, racial, or urban-rural distinctions that are not fully captured by "Nationalist Exclusion." A broader understanding of boundary work is needed to ensure the framework is sufficiently comprehensive.
**Expected Outcomes**:
-   **Expansion or Refinement of Boundary Dimensions**: The review could identify the need for new dimensions, such as "Religious/Sectarian Exclusion," "Racial/Ethnic Othering" (as distinct from civic/cultural nationalism), or "Geographic/Cultural Cleavage" (e.g., cosmopolitan metropole vs. authentic heartland).
-   **Enhanced Cross-Ideological Nuance**: This would allow the PDAF to better differentiate between left-wing populism's focus on "the oligarchy" (an economic boundary) and right-wing populism's focus on "the immigrant" or "the globalist" (a nationalist/cultural boundary), improving its analytical precision.
-   **Clearer Definition of "Economic Populist Appeals"**: The review would necessitate a more precise definition of this anchor to distinguish between left-wing (e.g., anti-neoliberal, pro-redistribution) and right-wing (e.g., producerist, anti-welfare for "undeserving" groups) economic populism.
