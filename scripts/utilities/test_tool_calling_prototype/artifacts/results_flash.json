      "reasoning": "The statement creates a clear \"us vs. them\" narrative, positioning the \"working class\" as the victim and the \"political class\" and \"wealthy politicians and donors\" as the perpetrators who are out of touch and pushing policies detrimental to the common people, explicitly highlighting a moral divide and implied corruption.",
      "relevance_score": 0.9,
      "context": "This is part of the immigration section, where Trump is contrasting the concerns of the 'working class' with the alleged actions and motivations of the 'political class' and 'wealthy politicians and donors.'"

      "dimension": "crisis_restoration_narrative",
      "context": "This is in the section where Trump is touting his administration's achievements, specifically economic progress. He frames the current situation as a recovery from long-standing neglect.",
      "quote": "Over the last 2 years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.",
      "reasoning": "This quote exemplifies the \"decline-crisis-redemption\" structure. It points to a long period of \"neglect\" by previous leaders (the crisis/decline) and positions his administration as acting with \"urgency and historic speed\" to \"confront problems,\" implying a restoration.",

      "quote": "The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It's the agenda of the American people.",
      "reasoning": "This statement claims that the proposed agenda directly reflects the will of \"the American people,\" positioning it as emanating from popular authority rather than partisan politics, thus hinting at popular sovereignty over institutional processes.",
      "context": "Early in the speech, Trump attempts to frame his agenda as universally representative, transcending partisan politics.",

      "quote": "If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.",
      "reasoning": "This statement rejects legitimate oversight (investigations) as being in opposition to the desired outcomes of \"peace and legislation,\" effectively delegitimizing political opposition and presenting it as an impediment to national progress, thus reflecting anti-pluralist tendencies."

      "quote": "I don't blame China for taking advantage of us; I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen.",
      "reasoning": "Trump's statement implies that \"our leaders and representatives\" allowed a \"travesty\" (unfair trade practices with China) to happen, suggesting a systemic failure or deliberate inaction within the political establishment that works against the people's interests, thus aligning with systemic corruption."

      "context": "Trump highlights his initiative on paid family leave. While not a direct \"I'm not a politician\" statement, it positions him as a leader delivering on issues that traditional politicians might overlook or fail to implement.",
      "reasoning": "By proudly stating he is the \"first President\" to include nationwide paid family leave, Trump implicitly contrasts himself with previous \"political class\" leaders who failed to address this need, positioning himself as a leader who genuinely delivers for the people, hinting at authenticity through effective action.",

      "reasoning": "This segment powerfully constructs a unified, \"extraordinary nation\" and calls to \"rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots,\" explicitly emphasizing a homogeneous national identity over any internal divisions.",
      "quote": "Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history. What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us. Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead."

      "reasoning": "The quote frames China as an external threat (\"targeting our industries,\" \"stealing our intellectual property,\" \"theft of American jobs and wealth\") that necessitates a strong national response, thereby emphasizing an \"us vs. them\" boundary defined along national economic lines."

Meanwhile, working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal immigration: reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded you can't get in, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.",
      "context": "This is part of the same section used for Manichaean framing, specifically detailing the economic consequences of illegal immigration for the working class.",
      "reasoning": "This passage clearly identifies \"wealthy politicians and donors\" as an economic elite whose policies (\"open borders\") negatively impact \"working-class Americans\" by causing \"reduced jobs, lower wages,\" and strain on public services, which is a direct economic populist appeal framing an elite against the economic interests of the people.",
