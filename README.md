> **Academic Validation Strategy: Expert Consultation + Statistical Evidence + Publication Pipeline**

## üéØ **MVP Focus: Moral Foundations Theory Validation**

Discernus is a **validation-first computational discourse analysis platform** designed for rigorous academic research. Our current focus is establishing academic credibility through systematic validation of Moral Foundations Theory implementation against established measures (MFQ-30) with expert consultation from framework originators.

**Strategic Objectives:**
- **Expert Endorsement**: Collaboration with Jonathan Haidt lab for MFT validation
- **Statistical Validation**: r>0.8 correlation with MFQ-30 across all foundations
- **Academic Publication**: Co-authored methodology paper with framework experts
- **Community Adoption**: Computational social science researcher platform usage

## üî¨ **Academic Research Infrastructure**

This platform prioritizes **academic research workflows** and **methodological rigor** over user interfaces. All development focuses on publication-quality methodology, expert consultation integration, and systematic validation evidence.

**Core Research Capabilities:**
- **Framework Validation**: Systematic testing against established psychological measures
- **Multi-LLM Reliability**: Cross-model consistency testing for methodological credibility  
- **Expert Integration**: Academic collaboration workflows with framework originators
- **Publication Pipeline**: Academic export formats and replication packages
- **Quality Assurance**: 6-layer validation preventing research failures

## üèóÔ∏è **Development Workflow**

### **üö® MANDATORY: Search Production Systems First**
```bash
# ALWAYS run before any new development:
python3 scripts/production/check_existing_systems.py "your functionality description"

# Check production systems inventory:
cat docs/EXISTING_SYSTEMS_INVENTORY.md

# Validate compliance with development standards:
python3 scripts/production/validate_ai_assistant_compliance.py --check-suggestion "your suggestion"
```

### Clean Architecture Standards
- ‚úÖ **Production**: `src/`, `scripts/production/`, `docs/specifications/` (stable, tested, documented)
- üß™ **Experimental**: `experimental/`, `sandbox/` (iteration, prototypes, testing)  
- üóëÔ∏è **Deprecated**: `deprecated/` (obsolete code - avoid using)

### Development Process
1. **Search First**: Use production search tools to find existing systems
2. **Enhance Existing**: Improve production code rather than rebuilding
3. **Build in Experimental**: New development starts in `experimental/prototypes/`
4. **Promote When Ready**: Move to production with quality validation
