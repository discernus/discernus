> **Academic Validation Strategy: Expert Consultation + Statistical Evidence + Publication Pipeline**

## üéØ **MVP Focus: Dual Framework Validation (MFT + PFT)**

Discernus is a **validation-first computational discourse analysis platform** designed for rigorous academic research. Our current focus is establishing academic credibility through systematic validation of our implementation using leading academic theories of moral psychology and political communication to evaluate contemporary textual narratives with expert consultation from framework originators.

**Strategic Objectives:**
- **Expert Endorsement**: Collaboration with Jonathan Haidt lab (MFT) and political framing theory researchers (PFT)
- **Statistical Validation**: r>0.8 correlation with MFQ-30 for MFT; systematic frame detection accuracy for PFT
- **Academic Publication**: Co-authored methodology papers with framework experts across moral psychology and political communication
- **Community Adoption**: Computational social science and political psychology researcher platform usage

## üî¨ **Academic Research Infrastructure**

This platform prioritizes **academic research workflows** and **methodological rigor** over user interfaces. All development focuses on publication-quality methodology, expert consultation integration, and systematic validation evidence.

**Core Research Capabilities:**
- **Framework Validation**: Systematic testing against established psychological measures
- **Multi-LLM Reliability**: Cross-model consistency testing for methodological credibility  
- **Expert Integration**: Academic collaboration workflows with framework originators
- **Publication Pipeline**: Academic export formats and replication packages
- **Quality Assurance**: 6-layer validation preventing research failures
