# Moral Foundations Theory Framework
# Based on Jonathan Haidt's research into the psychological foundations of human morality
# 
# This framework implements Haidt's five-foundation model using the new anchors architecture,
# representing the evolved psychological mechanisms that cultures build upon to create moral systems.

  Enhanced Moral Foundations Theory framework implementing Jonathan Haidt's research 
  with systematic methodological improvements for academic rigor. Uses the new 
  anchors-based coordinate system for improved clarity and extensibility.

theoretical_foundation:
  primary_sources:
    - "Haidt, J. (2012). The righteous mind: Why good people are divided by politics and religion."
    - "Graham, J., Haidt, J., Koleva, S., Motyl, M., Iyer, R., Wojcik, S., & Ditto, P. H. (2013). Moral foundations theory: The pragmatic validity of moral pluralism. Advances in experimental social psychology, 47, 55-130."
  
  theoretical_approach: |
    Based on Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory which identifies innate psychological 
    foundations that cultures build upon to create diverse moral systems. Updated
    to use anchors-based coordinate system for improved semantic clarity.

# =============================================================================
# PROMPT INTEGRATION
# =============================================================================

prompt_configuration:
  bias_mitigation_approach: "Enhanced prompts designed to prevent circular validation"
  
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert in moral psychology and value analysis with deep knowledge 
    of how moral reasoning manifests in discourse across cultures and political 
    orientations. You specialize in identifying implicit moral frameworks.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Analyze the values, principles, and moral reasoning present in this text. 
    Identify what moral concerns are emphasized, what behaviors are praised or 
    criticized, and what underlying value systems guide the reasoning.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for patterns of moral reasoning including: protection of vulnerable 
    individuals, concerns about fair treatment, group loyalty and solidarity, 
    respect for authority and tradition, and spiritual or purity concerns. 
    Analyze both explicit statements and implicit moral assumptions.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Score moral dimensions based on textual evidence of value emphasis, using 
    0.0-1.0 scale with specific quotations supporting each assessment. Focus on 
    strength of moral concern rather than political affiliation predictions.
  
  enhanced_detection_instructions: |
    Beyond explicit moral vocabulary, identify: (1) Syntactic patterns like moral 
    imperatives and causal moral reasoning, (2) Metaphorical expressions of values, 
    (3) Narrative moral positioning and role assignments, (4) Agent-patient 
    structures revealing moral agency, (5) Collective identity construction patterns.
