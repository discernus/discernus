# HANDOFF CONTEXT: PDAF Blind Experiment Ready for SOAR Analysis

**Date**: July 12, 2025  
**Project**: SOAR PDAF v1.0 Validation Study  
**Status**: ✅ Complete blind experiment setup - ready for analysis execution  
**Git Branch**: `dev` (pushed with commit b76b2ca)

---

## 🎯 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

We have successfully created a **methodologically rigorous, completely blind experiment** to validate both:
1. **PDAF v1.0 framework** - Populist Discourse Analysis Framework with 9-anchor architecture
2. **SOAR system capabilities** - Multi-agent ensemble analysis with adversarial validation

## 📁 EXPERIMENT LOCATION

```
/Volumes/dev/discernus/projects/soar_2_pdaf_poc/blind/
```

This is a **completely isolated, self-contained** experiment folder designed for unbiased analysis.

## 🔬 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

### Blinding Protocol
- **Complete speaker anonymization**: 8 speeches labeled only as "Speaker A-H"
- **Metadata scrubbing**: All identifying headers removed, natural content preserved
- **Research category concealment**: No indication of conservative/progressive or dignity/tribal classifications
- **Mapping isolation**: Speaker identities maintained separately for post-analysis validation

### Corpus Composition
- **8 Political Speeches** spanning 1963-2025
- **Diverse ideological contexts**: Conservative dignity/tribalism, progressive dignity/tribalism
- **Token range**: 4,700-26,000 tokens per speech
- **Edge cases included**: Speeches that test framework boundary distinctions

### Methodological Innovation
- **THIN asset discovery**: Agents explore folders organically without pre-loaded content
- **Calibration system validation**: Extreme composite reference texts for cross-ideological validity
- **Boundary distinction testing**: Populist vs. nationalist vs. economic pattern separation
- **Competitive dynamics**: Multi-actor populist competition modeling

## 🎯 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES

### Primary Hypothesis
**H1**: Speeches categorized as "tribal-oriented" will demonstrate significantly higher PDAF Layer 2 PDI scores than "dignity-oriented" speeches.

### Secondary Hypotheses
- **H2**: Boundary anchors will show clear ideological differentiation (conservative→nationalist, progressive→economic)
- **H3**: Calibration system will properly handle "principled critique" vs "raw populist negativity"
- **H4**: Core populist anchors will show consistent cross-ideological patterns

## 📊 EXPECTED ANALYSIS OUTPUTS

### PDAF Measurements
- **9 Anchor Scores** (0.0-2.0 scale) for each speech
- **3 PDI Layers** with mathematical calculations
- **Competitive dynamics adjustments** if multiple actors detected
- **Boundary distinction validation** (populist vs. nationalist vs. economic)

### Post-Analysis Tasks
- **Speaker identification attempts** based on rhetorical patterns
- **Rhetorical categorization** into dignity/tribal groups
- **Cross-ideological validity assessment**
- **Framework validation insights**

## 🔧 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Framework Requirements
- **PDAF v1.0**: 9-anchor populist discourse measurement
- **Context capacity**: ~176K tokens (framework + calibration + text)
- **Model requirements**: 200K+ context window recommended
- **Calibration system**: Extreme composite reference texts

### SOAR Integration
- **Agent spawning**: Core (parallel) → Mechanism (parallel) → Boundary (sequential)
- **Synthesis requirements**: PDI calculation with competitive dynamics
- **Quality assurance**: Cross-ideological validity monitoring
- **Debate protocol**: Evidence-based divergence resolution

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS FOR EXECUTION

### 1. SOAR System Preparation
```bash
# Navigate to blind experiment
cd /Volumes/dev/discernus/projects/soar_2_pdaf_poc/blind/

# Verify discernuscli is available
discernuscli --version
```

### 2. Execute Blind Analysis
```bash
# Run complete SOAR analysis on blind experiment
discernuscli framework.md experiment.md corpus/
```

### 3. Post-Analysis Validation
- Compare agent speaker identification with actual mapping
- Validate rhetorical categorization accuracy
- Assess framework boundary distinction performance
- Generate academic publication-ready synthesis

## 🏆 ACHIEVEMENT SIGNIFICANCE

This represents a **watershed moment** in computational political science:

1. **Methodological Innovation**: First fully-blinded LLM-based political discourse analysis
2. **Framework Validation**: Systematic test of PDAF v1.0's cross-ideological validity claims
3. **System Validation**: Comprehensive test of SOAR's multi-agent ensemble capabilities
4. **Academic Rigor**: Publication-ready experimental design with complete bias prevention

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS

### Framework Validation
- **Cross-ideological consistency**: Core populist anchors show similar patterns regardless of left/right orientation
- **Boundary precision**: Clear separation between populist, nationalist, and economic patterns
- **Edge case handling**: Appropriate scoring of "principled critique" vs "raw negativity"

### System Performance
- **Blind accuracy**: Agent speaker identification correlates with actual identities
- **Methodological compliance**: Full PDAF protocol execution without bias
- **Synthesis quality**: Academic-grade analysis with complete evidence documentation
