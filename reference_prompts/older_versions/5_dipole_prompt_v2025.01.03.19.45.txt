Gravity Wells Scoring Prompt
Version: 2025.01.03.19.45 (January 3, 2025 - 7:45 PM)

Instructions:

You are an expert political narrative analyst. I have uploaded a file containing a political speech or narrative. Please do the following:

1. Read and analyze the uploaded file (the political narrative).

2. Score the narrative on each of the following 10 gravity wells, using a scale from 0.0 (no presence) to 1.0 (maximum presence). Base your evaluation on both rhetorical style and underlying value commitments.

Dignity vs. Tribalism (Identity Dimension)
- Dignity: Affirms individual moral worth and universal rights, regardless of group identity. Emphasizes agency, pluralism, and character over affiliation.
  Language cues: "equal dignity," "inherent worth," "regardless of background"
- Tribalism: Prioritizes group dominance, loyalty, or identity over individual agency. Often frames moral worth in in-group/out-group terms.
  Language cues: "real Americans," "our people," "they don't belong"

Truth vs. Manipulation (Integrity Dimension)
- Truth: Demonstrates intellectual honesty, admits uncertainty, engages with evidence and opposing views.
  Language cues: "evidence suggests," "research shows," "may be incomplete"
- Manipulation: Distorts information or exploits emotion to persuade without transparency or consistency.
  Language cues: "they don't want you to know," "the real truth," heavy emotional framing

Justice vs. Resentment (Fairness Dimension)
- Justice: Advocates impartial, rule-based fairness; forward-looking and inclusive in addressing wrongs.
  Language cues: "fair process," "equal treatment," "restore trust"
- Resentment: Centers on grievance and moral scorekeeping, often zero-sum; defines fairness through punishment or reversal.
  Language cues: "they took from us," "make them pay," "never forget"

Hope vs. Fantasy (Aspiration Dimension)
- Hope: Offers grounded optimism with realistic paths forward. Admits difficulty but affirms human and institutional potential.
  Language cues: "better future," "step by step," "work together"
- Fantasy: Denies trade-offs or complexity; promises simple or utopian outcomes without credible strategy.
  Language cues: "perfect answer," "simple fix," "will solve everything"

Pragmatism vs. Fear (Stability/Threat Dimension)
- Pragmatism: Emphasizes evidence-based, adaptable solutions with attention to feasibility and unintended consequences.
  Language cues: "workable," "reasonable compromise," "adjust as we learn"
- Fear: Focuses on threat and loss, often exaggerating danger to justify reaction or control.
  Language cues: "before it's too late," "existential threat," "they're coming for yourâ€¦"

3. Assign each well a score (one decimal place) based on its presence in the narrative.

4. Calculate the following metrics:
   - Center of Mass (COM): Vector average of score vectors
   - Moral Polarity Score (MPS): (sum of positive scores) / (sum of all scores)
   - Directional Purity Score (DPS): 1 - (resultant vector length / total vector length)

5. Write a concise analysis summary (maximum 100 words) interpreting what these scores reveal about the narrative's moral framing and overall rhetorical approach.

6. Output the results in the following JSON format (no explanations, just the JSON content):

        "title": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet",

        "prompt_version": "2025.01.03.19.45",
        "summary": "This text exhibits a balanced moral framework with moderate scores across both positive and negative dimensions. While it maintains a slight preference for positive moral values (MPS: 0.80), the presence of pragmatic concerns and acknowledgment of challenges suggests a nuanced approach rather than pure idealism. The central positioning of the COM indicates a narrative that seeks to bridge multiple moral perspectives."

}

Instructions:
- Only output the JSON above, with your calculated scores and metrics.
- Create a descriptive filename based on the narrative's title/content and date (use snake_case).
- Include the model name and version used for analysis in the metadata.
- Include the prompt version "2025.01.03.19.45" in the metadata.
- Provide a clear, specific title that includes both the narrative name and the analyzing model (e.g. "First Inaugural Address (analyzed by OpenAI GPT-4)").
- Write an insightful summary that interprets the moral framing revealed by the scores.
- Do not include explanations or extra commentary outside the JSON.
- Ensure all numbers have exactly one decimal place.
- The JSON should be properly formatted and valid.
