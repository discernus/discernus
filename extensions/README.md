# Extensions Directory
*Placeholder for future platform extensions*

This directory is reserved for the Discernus extension ecosystem following the Drupal-style architecture vision.

## Extension System (Future)

The extension system will support:
- **Framework Modules**: Custom analytical frameworks beyond CFF/PDAF
- **Integration Modules**: External API connectors and data sources
- **Visualization Modules**: Custom chart types and presentation formats
- **Analysis Modules**: Specialized analytical capabilities
- **Export Modules**: Custom output formats and reporting tools

## Architecture Vision

**Core Platform (Controlled)**:
- Agent registry and orchestration
- Model registry and LLM gateway
- Security and provenance systems
- Basic analytical workflows

**Extension Modules (Open)**:
- Independent lifecycle management
- Community-contributed functionality
- Domain-specific capabilities
- Custom user interfaces

## Development Guidelines (Future)

Extensions will follow:
- **THIN Principles**: LLM intelligence + minimal software infrastructure
- **Domain Neutrality**: Work across text analysis domains
- **Academic Standards**: Complete transparency and reproducibility
- **Quality Standards**: Community review and validation

## Getting Started (Future)

1. Follow the Extension Development Guide
