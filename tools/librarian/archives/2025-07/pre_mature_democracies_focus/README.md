# Archived Framework Weight Research Studies

**Archive Date**: July 21, 2025  
**Archive Reason**: Focus transition to mature democracies exclusively  
**Archive Location**: `discernus/librarian/archives/2025-07/pre_mature_democracies_focus/`

## Archive Overview

This directory contains **20 research studies** from multiple research phases that preceded the refined research methodology focusing exclusively on mature democracies. These studies were archived to maintain research provenance while allowing the meta-analysis to focus on the enhanced methodology.

### Research Data (12 files)
- Corresponding JSON files: `discernus_librarian_data_20250721_[timestamp].json`
- Each contains full research methodology, findings, and validation data

## Why These Were Archived

1. **Methodological Refinement**: The later studies (19:42:37 - 20:23:52) implemented enhanced prompts focusing exclusively on mature democracies to isolate effects from confounding variables
2. **Research Focus**: Meta-analysis needed to focus on studies with consistent methodology and scope constraints
3. **Quality Control**: The mature democracies constraint provided more rigorous research controls and cleaner evidence base

## Research Value

While archived for the current meta-analysis, these studies contain valuable research on:
- Framework weight validation across broader democratic contexts
- Early methodology development for DiscernusLibrarian research
- Comparative insights across different research approaches
- Evidence patterns that informed the refined methodology

## Access and Provenance

- **Full Provenance**: All original research data and findings preserved
- **Research Integrity**: No data was deleted, only organized for focused analysis
- **Future Reference**: These studies remain available for comparative analysis or broader research questions
- **Methodology Evolution**: Documents the progression from broader to more focused research approaches

## Related Documentation

- **Current Meta-Analysis**: `docs/research/framework_weight_validation/meta_analysis/triple_weighting_meta_analysis.md`
- **Active Studies**: Focus on 10 mature democracies studies (19:42:37 - 20:23:52)
- **Research Methodology**: Enhanced multi-stage Perplexity validation with red team fact-checking

---

**Archive Integrity**: ✅ All 32 files (20 reports + 12 JSON) successfully preserved  
**Research Continuity**: ✅ Meta-analysis now focuses on methodologically consistent mature democracies studies
