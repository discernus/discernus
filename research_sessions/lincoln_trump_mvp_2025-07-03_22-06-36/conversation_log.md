For analyzing unity vs division in inaugural addresses, I recommend this systematic methodology:

**Step 1: Initial Reading and Theme Identification**
- Read both addresses completely
- Identify major themes in each (unity, division, hope, fear, etc.)
- Note rhetorical strategies and audience appeals

**Step 2: Theme Ranking by Salience**
- Count frequency of unity vs division language patterns
- Assess emotional framing (inclusive vs exclusive)
- Evaluate calls to action (collaborative vs adversarial)

**Step 3: Targeted Attribute Analysis**
- Quantitative analysis of pronouns (we/us vs they/them)
- Sentiment analysis of key passages
- Comparison of shared values vs outgroup targeting

This approach will provide systematic comparison of Lincoln's post-Civil War healing message versus Trump's contemporary political rhetoric.

Does this methodology look right to you?
