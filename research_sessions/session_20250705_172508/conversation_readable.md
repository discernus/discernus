## ðŸ“‹ Conversation Metadata
**Research Question:** 
I've developed this novel CFF framework that uses several new terms like 'graduated normative layering' and 'competitive dynamics modeling.' I need help understanding:

1. What academic equivalents exist for these novel terms?
2. How does this framework relate to existing academic literature?
3. What theoretical foundations should I cite to strengthen the framework?
4. Are there any semantic gaps or terminology issues I should address?

Please conduct a framework interrogation to identify novel terminology and provide literature validation for academic grounding.
