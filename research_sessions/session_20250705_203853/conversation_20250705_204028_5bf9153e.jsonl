Below is a definition of each term within the CFF's context, followed by its mapping to established concepts.\n\n**1. CFF Term: Resonant Coherence**\n*   **CFF Definition:** The state of alignment between an individual's internal values and the expressed values and goals of their community. This is characterized by a felt sense of belonging, mutual understanding, and shared purpose, reducing internal conflict and social friction.\n*   **Mapping to Established Concepts:**\n    *   **Person-Environment Fit (Organizational Psychology):** This directly maps to the concept of an individual's values, personality, and goals matching the climate and culture of their environment (e.g., a workplace or community).\n    *   **Social Identity", "metadata": {"role": "moderator", "turn": 2, "code_executed": false}}

Social Identity Theory posits that a person's sense of self is derived from their perceived membership in relevant social groups. \"Resonant Coherence\" describes the psychological state that occurs when an individual has successfully internalized the group's identity, leading to an alignment of personal and group values and behaviors.\n    *   **Absence of Cognitive Dissonance (Psychology):** The CFF's emphasis on reducing \"internal conflict\" is a direct reference to the state of cognitive consonance, where an individual's beliefs, attitudes, and actions are in harmony, preventing the mental stress of dissonance.\n\n**2. CFF Term: Generative Friction**\n*   **CFF Definition:** Productive, managed disagreement or tension within a group that challenges existing assumptions, prevents groupthink, and sparks innovation and adaptation. It is distinct from destructive conflict, as it is focused on ideas and processes, not personalities, and is channeled toward a shared goal.\n*   **Mapping to Established Concepts:**\n    *   **Constructive Conflict / Task Conflict (Organizational Psychology):** This is a direct parallel. Research distinguishes between task conflict (disagreements about the work being done), which can be beneficial for performance and decision quality, and relationship conflict (interpersonal incompatibilities), which is almost always detrimental. \"Generative Friction\" is a more dynamic term for managed task conflict.\n    *   **Dialectical Inquiry (Management Theory):** This is a structured method for realizing Generative Friction. It involves examining a proposal by exploring its opposite (an antithesis) to arrive at a more robust synthesis of ideas.\n    *   **Groupthink (Social Psychology):** Generative Friction is positioned as the primary antidote to groupthink, the pathological drive for consensus at all costs, which leads to poor decision-making.\n\n**3. CFF Term: Systemic Resilience**\n*   **CFF Definition:** The capacity of a social system (e.g., a community or organization) not just to withstand and recover from shocks and stressors, but to adapt and transform in response to them, often becoming more capable and cohesive as a result.\n*   **Mapping to Established Concepts:**\n    *   **Resilience (Ecology & Psychology):** The CFF extends the psychological concept of individual resilience to the group level, mirroring its original application in ecology, which studies how ecosystems absorb disturbances.\n    *   **Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) (Systems Theory):** This concept views social groups as complex adaptive systems. \"Systemic Resilience\" is an emergent property of such a system, arising from the interactions of its autonomous agents (individuals) and its feedback loops.\n    *   **Antifragility (as coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb):** This is a strong conceptual match. While resilience is about absorbing shock and returning to the previous state, antifragility describes systems that gain from disorder and volatility. The CFF's definition, which includes becoming \"more capable,\" aligns closely with antifragility.\n\n**4.
