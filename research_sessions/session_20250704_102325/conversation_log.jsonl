Key Populist Rhetorical Markers and Themes:\n\nA. Anti-Establishment Framework:\n- Direct attacks on \"corrupt elite\" (particularly PT and traditional politicians)\n- Positioning himself as an outsider despite long political career\n- Anti-institutional rhetoric targeting media, universities, and judiciary\n\nB. People-Centric Discourse:\n- Heavy use of \"povo brasileiro\" (Brazilian people) as legitimizing force\n- Construction of \"authentic Brazilians\" vs \"corrupt establishment\"\n- Frequent appeals to \"family values\" and \"traditional morality\"\n\n2. Baseline Framework of Populist Elements:\n\n```python\n# Creating structured analysis of rhetorical elements\npopulist_framework = {\n    'moral_binary': {\n        'positive': ['povo', 'família', 'ordem', 'Deus', 'militar'],\n        'negative': ['corrupção', 'comunismo', 'PT', 'globalismo']\n    },\n    'rhetorical_devices': {\n        'direct_address': 'frequent use of \"você\" and \"nosso\"',\n        'emotional_amplification': 'use of extreme cases and moral panic',\n        'simplification': 'complex issues reduced to moral choices'\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. Distinctive Rhetorical Devices:\n\na) Militaristic Language:\n- Use of command-style directives\n- Military metaphors for political action\n- Integration of military values into civilian discourse\n\nb) Crisis Narratives:\n- Apocalyptic framing of political opposition\n- Moral decay narratives\n- Security-threat amplification\n\nc) Digital Populism Markers:\n- Short, punchy statements optimized for social media\n- Use of memes and viral content\n- Direct, informal communication style\n\n4. Construction of People vs Elite:\n\nThe People (\"O Povo\"):\n- Hardworking ordinary Brazilians\n- Conservative family values\n- Christian religious identity\n- Law-abiding citizens\n- Military/police supporters\n\nThe Elite (\"A Elite\"):\n- Political establishment (especially PT)\n- Mainstream media\n- Academics/intellectuals\n- NGOs and international organizations\n- Cultural \"leftists\"\n\nKey Rhetorical Pattern Analysis:\n\n```python\n# Analysis of rhetorical pattern frequency\nrhetorical_patterns = {\n    'binary_oppositions': {\n        'moral_people': ['trabalhador', 'família', 'cristão'],\n        'corrupt_elite': ['político tradicional', 'comunista', 'globalista']\n    },\n    'legitimacy_claims': {\n        'divine': 'religious references',\n        'popular': 'will of the people',\n        'nationalist': 'patriotic duty'\n    }\n}\n\n# Tracking emotional amplification patterns\nemotional_markers = {\n    'fear': ['ameaça', 'perigo', 'destruição'],\n    'anger': ['corrupção', 'traição', 'vergonha'],\n    'pride': ['Brasil', 'pátria', 'ordem']\n}\n```\n\nDistinctive Features:\n1.
