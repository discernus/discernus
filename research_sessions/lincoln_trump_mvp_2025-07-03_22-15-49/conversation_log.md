I apologize, but I notice a methodological issue we need to address: While Lincoln's 1865 Second Inaugural Address is a historical document we can analyze, Trump's 2025 inaugural address does not yet exist since that event is in the future. We cannot conduct a comparative analysis with a text that hasn't been written.

However, I can propose a modified methodology that would:

1. Initial Reading and Theme Identification
- Analyze Lincoln's 1865 Second Inaugural for unifying themes
- Compare with Lincoln's 1861 First Inaugural and Trump's 2017 Inaugural as contextual references
- Create thematic codebook focused on unity/division markers

2. Theme Ranking by Salience
- Quantify frequency of unifying vs divisive language
- Assess contextual impact of key phrases
- Compare rhetoric patterns across the three existing speeches

3. Targeted Attribute Analysis
- Measure specific unity indicators:
  * Inclusive pronouns (we, our, us)
  * References to shared values/history
  * Calls for reconciliation
  * Acknowledgment of opposing views
- Compare these metrics across the speeches

This would give us a framework for analyzing inaugural address unity that could later be applied to future speeches.

Does this methodology look right to you? We can adjust it based on your specific research needs or if you'd prefer to focus on different comparison points.

Thank you for the methodology, but I need to correct a temporal assumption: It is currently July 2025, so Trump's January 2025 inaugural address has already occurred and we have the full text available.

We have both inaugural addresses ready for analysis:
- Lincoln's 1865 Second Inaugural Address (historical)  
- Trump's 2025 Inaugural Address (recent, from January 2025)

Please proceed with your proposed methodology to compare these two specific addresses for their unifying vs divisive rhetoric. Does this look right to you?
