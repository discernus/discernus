  "research_question": "\nI've developed this novel CFF framework that uses several new terms like 'graduated normative layering' and 'competitive dynamics modeling.' I need help understanding:\n\n1. What academic equivalents exist for these novel terms?\n2. How does this framework relate to existing academic literature?\n3. What theoretical foundations should I cite to strengthen the framework?\n4. Are there any semantic gaps or terminology issues I should address?\n\nPlease conduct a framework interrogation to identify novel terminology and provide literature validation for academic grounding.\n",
