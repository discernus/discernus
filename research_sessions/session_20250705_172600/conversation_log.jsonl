TERM CONSTRUCTION ASSESSMENT\n\nMorphological Patterns:\n- Consistent [Modifier]+[Domain]+[Process] structure (e.g., \"graduated normative layering\")\n- Terms follow academic compound construction patterns\n- High transparency for \"emotional mapping\" and \"dynamics modeling\"\n- Lower transparency for \"graduated normative layering\" - needs clearer definition\n\n3.

Terminology Refinement:\n- Replace \"graduated normative layering\" with \"normative scale analysis\"\n- Specify \"rhetorical competitive dynamics\" to distinguish from other fields\n- Add qualifying terms to \"social health assessment\" (e.g., \"discourse-based social health assessment\")\n\n2. Definition Enhancement:\n- Create explicit operational definitions for each term\n- Establish measurement criteria\n- Define boundary conditions\n\n3. Cross-disciplinary Integration:\n- Map terms to established concepts in each field\n- Address potential disciplinary conflicts\n- Provide field-specific usage guidelines\n\n4. Semantic Gap Resolution:\n- Develop clear transition criteria between descriptive and normative levels\n- Establish precise boundaries between emotional and behavioral analysis\n- Create explicit links between individual terms and framework axes\n\nThis analysis suggests the framework is semantically coherent but requires additional precision in terminology and clearer operational definitions to facilitate academic adoption.", "metadata": {"role": "expert", "turn": 4, "requested_by": "moderator_llm", "code_executed": true}}
