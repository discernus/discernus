  "research_question": "\nUsing the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v2.0, analyze ONLY the Identity axis of this speech.\n\nFocus exclusively on:\n- Individual Dignity vs Tribal Dominance positioning\n- Evidence for universal human worth, moral agency, pluralistic respect\n- Evidence for group loyalty over universal principles, hierarchical exclusion\n- Competitive dynamics between these two poles\n- Confidence levels based on evidence quality\n\nApply CFF Layer 3 (Comprehensive Social Health Assessment) but ONLY for the Identity axis.\nUse the full normative evaluation capability but constrain to identity dimensions only.\n\nProvide structured analysis with:\n1. Individual Dignity score (0.0-1.0) with specific evidence citations\n2. Tribal Dominance score (0.0-1.0) with specific evidence citations  \n3. Competitive dynamics analysis between the two poles\n4. Confidence levels and uncertainty flags\n5. Reasoning chains for all scoring decisions\n\nExpected format: Complete CFF v2.0 analysis structure but limited to Identity axis.\n",
