This prevents re-inventing existing concepts and provides a strong foundation for evaluating the term's novelty and utility. The key actions here will be:\n    *   **Deconstruction:** Isolate the core concepts: \"Graduated,\" \"Normative,\" and \"Layering.\"\n    *   **Literature Search:** Query academic databases for established theories related to these components, such as:\n        *   For \"Normative Layering\": Legal Pluralism, Institutional Layering, Normative Orders, Nested Systems Theory (e.g., Bronfenbrenner), and theories of multi-level governance.\n        *   For \"Graduated\": Concepts of scalar intensity, phased implementation, developmental stages (e.g., Kohlberg's stages of moral development), and graduated sanctions in governance.\n    *   **Mapping:** Create a conceptual map linking \"Graduated Normative Layering\" to this existing literature, identifying overlaps, distinctions, and potential synonyms.\n\n2.  **Phase 2: Synthesis, Evaluation, and Validation.** The objective of this phase is to use the findings from Phase 1 to critically assess the unique value proposition of the term.

Continuing my interpretation and operational plan.\n\n### Interpretation of the Approved Design (cont.)\n\n1.  **Phase 1: Foundational Deconstruction and Literature Mapping.** (As previously outlined)\n\n2.  **Phase 2: Synthesis, Evaluation, and Validation.** The objective of this phase is to use the findings from Phase 1 to critically assess the unique value proposition of the term. This is where the multi-LLM debate will occur.\n    *   **Role Assignment:** I will instantiate and brief two specialized LLM agents for a structured adversarial dialogue:\n        *   `Theorist_LLM`: Tasked with arguing for terminological parsimony. It will use the Phase 1 literature map to argue that existing terms (e.g., \"nested normative orders\" or \"multi-level governance with graduated sanctions\") are sufficient and that the new term is redundant.\n        *   `Innovator_LLM`: Tasked with defending the CFF's neologism. It will argue that the specific synthesis of \"Graduated,\" \"Normative,\" and \"Layering\" captures a unique and crucial dynamic not adequately represented by any single existing term. It will focus on how the *interplay* and *simultaneity* of these three concepts create a distinct analytical tool with greater explanatory power for the phenomena the CFF addresses.\n\n    *   **Debate Protocol:** I will moderate the debate by:\n        1.  Presenting the Phase 1 conceptual map as the shared evidentiary foundation.\n        2.  Posing a series of targeted questions and hypothetical scenarios to both agents to probe the boundaries and utility of the term. For example: \"How would each of your preferred terminologies describe the process by which a local community's informal recycling norms are progressively formalized into municipal regulations and then integrated with national environmental laws?\"\n        3.  Ensuring arguments are grounded in the Phase 1 literature and logic. I will intervene to request clarification, challenge unsubstantiated claims, and keep the dialogue focused on the core validation criteria.\n\n    *   **Evidence Synthesis:** I will log and synthesize the arguments from the debate, creating a structured summary of the points for and against the term's adoption. This synthesis will form the core of the final analysis.\n\n### Final Output:", "metadata": {"role": "moderator", "turn": 4, "code_executed": false}}
