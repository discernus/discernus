# Issue #186: Single-Model Foundation Implementation

**Priority**: High  
**Epic**: #218 (Academic Research-Aligned LLM Ensemble Architecture)  
**Phase**: Foundation  
**Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks

## Description

Implement Phase 1 configuration with Claude 4 Sonnet and research-validated temperature optimization based on Issue #213 research findings. This establishes the foundation for progressive ensemble optimization with academically rigorous single-model baseline.

## Research Foundation

Based on Issue #213 comprehensive LLM parameter research:
- **Claude 4 Sonnet** shows superior structured reasoning and JSON compliance
- **Temperature 0.2** eliminates pathological behaviors while maintaining analytical flexibility
- **Single-model phase** provides 60-70% of theoretical maximum accuracy
- **Cost baseline** (1x multiplier) for cost-performance optimization

## Deliverables

- [ ] **Claude 4 Sonnet Integration**
  - Configure Claude 4 Sonnet as primary model for all THIN agents
  - Implement temperature 0.2 optimization across all agent interactions
  - Validate model performance against existing Gemini 2.5 Flash baseline

- [ ] **Model Performance Benchmarking**
  - Comprehensive accuracy testing across all v5.0 frameworks (CAF, PDAF, CFF, ECF, CHF)
  - Performance comparison with existing model configurations
  - Cost-performance analysis with detailed metrics

- [ ] **JSON Schema Compliance Validation**
  - Structured output validation for all THIN agent responses
  - Schema compliance rate measurement and optimization
  - Error handling for malformed responses

- [ ] **THIN Agent Framework Integration**
  - Update AnalyticalCodeGenerator for Claude 4 Sonnet optimization
  - Update CodeExecutor with enhanced model integration
  - Update EvidenceCurator with improved analytical capabilities
  - Update ResultsInterpreter with Claude's superior reasoning

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Performance Target**: Claude 4 Sonnet achieves 60-70% of theoretical maximum accuracy

  - Statistical significance testing of performance improvements
  - Quantified accuracy metrics across all supported frameworks
  - Confidence intervals for performance measurements

- [ ] **Model Selection Justification**
  - Comparative benchmarks against other flagship models
  - Documentation of Claude 4 Sonnet advantages for structured analytical tasks
  - Integration advantages with existing THIN architecture
