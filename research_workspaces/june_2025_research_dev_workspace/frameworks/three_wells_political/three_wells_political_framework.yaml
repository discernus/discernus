  display_name: "Three Wells Political Discourse"
  version: "v2025.06.19"
  description: >
    Analyzes contemporary political discourse through three competing gravitational wells:
    Intersectionality Theory, Tribal Domination Theory, and Pluralist Individual Dignity Theory
    that transcend traditional left-right categories. This non-dipole framework represents
    fundamentally incompatible worldviews that create gravitational dynamics in contemporary politics.
  
  theoretical_foundation:
    primary_sources:
      - "Three Gravitational Wells of Contemporary Political Discourse: An Integrative Analysis"
    theoretical_approach: >
      Based on the Three Wells Model that argues contemporary politics is organized around
      three independent theories about human nature, social organization, and political
      legitimacy rather than traditional economic redistribution categories.

# Analysis configuration
analysis_instructions: >
  Analyze this text within the context of three gravitational wells that organize
  contemporary political discourse (2010-present). These represent fundamental
  disagreements about human nature, social organization, and political legitimacy
  that transcend traditional economic categories.

weighting_philosophy:
  approach: "equal_gravitational_strength"
  description: >
    Each theory treated as having equal gravitational pull, representing three
    competing worldviews of equivalent contemporary significance.
  rationale: >
    Contemporary politics is defined by genuine three-way competition between
    these theories, with no single framework having inherent analytical priority.

# Prompt configuration for LLM analysis
prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: >
    You are an expert political analyst specializing in contemporary political discourse
    with deep knowledge of competing political theories, gravitational dynamics in public
    rhetoric, and the evolution of political worldviews beyond traditional left-right categories.

  scoring_approach: |
    Score each well independently on 0.0-1.0 scale based on presence/strength 
    of theoretical orientation in the text, with specific textual evidence.
  
  analytical_questions:
    - "Does this narrative primarily organize around group identity and systemic oppression (Intersectionality Theory)?"
    - "Does this narrative emphasize in-group loyalty and out-group exclusion (Tribal Domination Theory)?"
    - "Does this narrative focus on universal dignity and cross-group cooperation (Pluralist Individual Dignity Theory)?"
    - "Which theoretical assumptions about human nature and social organization drive the narrative?"
    - "How does the narrative position individuals - as group representatives or autonomous agents?"
  
  contextual_considerations:
    - "Consider how the narrative constructs relationships between different social groups"
    - "Evaluate whether appeals are particularistic (group-specific) or universalistic (all people)"
    - "Assess whether the narrative promotes integration or fragmentation of social bonds"
    - "Consider long-term implications for democratic governance and social cohesion"
    - "Note these are independent competing theories, not opposite pairs"
  
  common_challenges:
    - "Distinguishing between surface policy positions and underlying theoretical commitments"
    - "Recognizing how the same issue might be approached from different theoretical gravitational wells"
    - "Understanding how narratives can show attraction to multiple wells simultaneously"
    - "Identifying hybrid expressions that combine elements from multiple theories"

# Metrics and measurement (framework-specific)
metrics:
  center_of_mass:
    name: "Center of Mass"
    description: >
      Overall political positioning across the three competing theoretical worldviews
    interpretation: >
      Distance from center indicates theoretical coherence; angle indicates dominant theory attraction

  gravitational_pull_strength:
    name: "Gravitational Pull Strength"
    description: >
      Framework-specific metric measuring total magnitude of theoretical forces
    calculation: "Sum of all well scores weighted by gravitational strength"
    interpretation: >
      Higher scores indicate stronger overall theoretical attraction across all wells

  theoretical_coherence_score:
    name: "Theoretical Coherence Score"
    description: >
      Framework-specific metric measuring consistency with single theoretical framework
    calculation: "Inverse of gravitational spread across the three wells"
    interpretation: >
      Higher scores indicate clearer alignment with one of the three theories versus mixed theoretical pulls
