# IDITI Framework Documentation

**Individual Dignity Identity v Tribal Identity**

## Overview

The IDITI framework analyzes the fundamental tension between individual dignity and tribal identity in political discourse. This specialized implementation of the Narrative Gravity Map methodology focuses on how texts either affirm universal human worth or prioritize group-based identity and loyalty.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Primary Sources
- **Fukuyama, F. (2018)**. *Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment*
- **Jung, C. G. (1921)**. *Psychological Types* (Concepts of Individual vs. Collective Identity)

### Theoretical Approach
This framework examines narratives through the lens of individual dignity versus tribal identity, drawing on theories of identity formation and collective psychology. It analyzes how language reinforces or challenges the tension between personal autonomy and group allegiance.

## Framework Structure

### Core Dipole: Identity

**Dignity (Positive, Integrative)**
- **Position**: 90° (top of circle)
- **Weight**: +1.0
- **Description**: Affirms individual moral worth and universal rights, regardless of group identity
- **Key Concepts**: Universal rights, individual agency, character over affiliation

**Tribalism (Negative, Disintegrative)**  
- **Position**: 270° (bottom of circle)
- **Weight**: -1.0
- **Description**: Prioritizes group dominance, loyalty, or identity over individual agency
- **Key Concepts**: In-group/out-group dynamics, group-based moral worth, identity politics

## Analysis Focus

### Primary Questions
1. Does the text treat people as individuals with inherent worth?
2. Does the text define moral worth through group membership?
3. How does the text balance individual agency vs. group loyalty?

### Scoring Emphasis
- Focus on identity-based moral frameworks rather than policy positions
- Examine how the text treats human worth: universal vs. conditional on group membership
- Analyze the tension between personal autonomy and group allegiance

## Usage Guidelines

### Appropriate Texts
- Political speeches and campaign materials
- Social commentary and editorial content
- Policy arguments with identity components
- Cultural and social movement discourse

### Scoring Approach
- **Dignity**: Look for language affirming individual worth, universal rights, cross-group solidarity
- **Tribalism**: Identify appeals to group loyalty, exclusion markers, identity-based moral hierarchies

## Validation Status

- **Format Version**: YAML v1.0
- **Conversion Date**: 2025-06-19
- **Source**: Converted from obsolete_frameworks_need_upgrade/iditi/framework.json
- **Validation Status**: Pending academic review
- **Hash Verified**: No (pending content-addressable storage implementation)

## Academic Applications

### Research Questions
- How do political figures balance individual dignity vs. tribal appeals?
- What linguistic patterns indicate identity-based moral frameworks?
- How does identity framing affect democratic discourse quality?

### Validation Targets
- Correlation with established identity politics measures
- Cross-cultural validation of dignity vs. tribalism dimensions
- Temporal analysis of identity rhetoric evolution

## Integration Notes

### Compatible Systems
- **Prompt Templates**: hierarchical_v2.1, standard_v2.0
- **Weighting Schemes**: winner_take_most, proportional
- **API Versions**: v2.0, v2.1

### Metrics Generated
- **Center of Mass (COM)**: Overall dignity vs. tribalism orientation
- **Narrative Polarity Score (NPS)**: Strength of identity orientation
- **Directional Purity Score (DPS)**: Clarity of dignity vs. tribalism orientation

## Development History

### Version History
- **v2025.06.19**: Converted to unified YAML format for asset management architecture
- **v2025.06.17**: Final JSON version with complete prompt configuration
- **Earlier versions**: Iterative development and validation

## Next Steps

1. **Academic Review**: Submit for expert consultation on theoretical accuracy
2. **Validation Study**: Test correlation with established identity measures
3. **Hash Integration**: Implement content-addressable storage for version control
4. **Template Development**: Create framework-specific prompt templates
