validation_results:
  framework_loading: "✅ SUCCESS - Loads in production system"
  dipole_structure: "✅ CORRECT - 5 foundation pairs detected"
  theoretical_grounding: "✅ VALIDATED - Haidt literature compliant"
  academic_readiness: "✅ PREPARED - Expert consultation ready"

next_steps:
  - "Import framework to database via framework_sync.py"
  - "Create experiment definition using MFT framework"
  - "Test end-to-end analysis pipeline"
  - "Prepare expert consultation materials"

development_notes: |
  This initial implementation correctly represents Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory
  as dipole pairs rather than independent wells. The previous mft_persuasive_force
  framework incorrectly implemented MFT as 10 separate wells, which was 
  theoretically inaccurate for expert consultation.
