# Moral Foundations Theory Framework

**Version**: v2025.06.19-critical-repairs  
**Status**: ⚠️ Critical Vulnerabilities Addressed - Systematic Repairs Applied  
**Implementation**: Major Fixes Applied Based on Expert Review - Further Validation Required

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE** ⚠️

**Expert Review Findings**: Following expert review, this framework was identified as having **8 fatal weaknesses** that would lead to peer review destruction despite methodological improvements. **Systematic repairs have been applied** but **further validation is required** before deployment.

**Current Limitations**:
- 🚨 **NO RESULTS PUBLISHABLE** until empirical weights derived (current equal weighting is provisional)
- 🚨 **Scope Limited** to English-language political discourse only (cross-cultural claims removed)
- 🚨 **Reliability Targets Lowered** to literature-realistic levels (κ ≥ 0.65 initial target)
- 🚨 **MFQ Correlation Expectations** reduced to r > 0.4 overall (survey-text typically r ≈ 0.3-0.5)

## **Overview**

This framework implements Jonathan Haidt's **Moral Foundations Theory** with **critical repairs applied** following expert review. While featuring **multi-layered moral detection** beyond lexical reductionism and **bias-neutral design**, the framework requires **emergency weight derivation** and **realistic validation protocols** before academic deployment.

## **Theoretical Foundation**

### **Core Theory**
Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory proposes that human morality is built upon several innate psychological foundations, not just care and fairness as traditionally emphasized in moral psychology. These foundations evolved to address adaptive challenges faced by humans living in groups.

### **The Six Foundation Pairs** (Updated for Theoretical Completeness)

1. **Care ↔ Harm**: Evolved from mammalian attachment and empathy
   - Care: Compassion, protection, helping others
   - Harm: Cruelty, violence, causing suffering

2. **Fairness ↔ Cheating**: Evolved from reciprocal altruism
   - Fairness: Justice, equality, proportional treatment
   - Cheating: Exploitation, unfair advantage, corruption

3. **Loyalty ↔ Betrayal**: Evolved from group cooperation needs
   - Loyalty: Patriotism, solidarity, sacrifice for group
   - Betrayal: Disloyalty, treason, abandoning group

4. **Authority ↔ Subversion**: Evolved from hierarchical social structures
   - Authority: Respect for hierarchy, tradition, order
   - Subversion: Rebellion, chaos, undermining leadership

5. **Sanctity ↔ Degradation**: Evolved from contamination avoidance
   - Sanctity: Purity, sacredness, spiritual elevation
   - Degradation: Contamination, debasement, pollution

6. **Liberty ↔ Oppression**: Evolved from responses to domination *(Critical Addition)*
   - Liberty: Freedom, autonomy, resistance to coercion
   - Oppression: Domination, restriction of autonomy, tyranny

## **Political Psychology Insights**

### **Foundation Usage Patterns**
- **Liberals**: Primarily rely on **individualizing foundations** (Care, Fairness)
- **Conservatives**: Use **all five foundations** more equally
- **Libertarians**: Emphasize **Liberty** (when included as 6th foundation)

### **Academic Validation**
- **Cross-cultural validation** across 67+ countries
- **Strong correlation** with liberal-conservative political orientation
- **Validated instruments**: MFQ-30, MFQ-2 questionnaires
- **Robust empirical support** in political psychology literature

## **Implementation Details**

### **Enhanced Framework Structure**
```yaml
framework_type: dipoles_based
coordinate_system: circular (visualization only - no analytical significance)
foundations: 6 dipole pairs (Liberty added for theoretical completeness)
weighting: equal_provisional (CRITICAL: no results publishable until empirical weights)
detection: multi_layered_analysis
validation: realistic_targets_applied
```

### **Methodological Enhancements**
- **Equal Weighting** (all 1.0): Eliminates arbitrary assumptions pending empirical derivation
- **Multi-Layered Detection**: Syntactic patterns, semantic roles, metaphorical analysis, narrative positioning
- **Bias-Neutral Prompts**: Prevent circular validation by avoiding explicit foundation naming
- **Pre-Registered Protocols**: Cohen's κ ≥ 0.75 reliability targets with systematic adjudication

### **Enhanced Detection Methodology**
**Beyond Basic Keywords** - sophisticated moral reasoning detection:
- **Syntactic Analysis**: Moral imperatives, causal moral language, conditional statements
- **Semantic Analysis**: Agent-patient structures, moral justification patterns, value attribution
- **Metaphorical Analysis**: Care metaphors ("safety net"), fairness metaphors ("level playing field")
- **Narrative Analysis**: Victim-perpetrator-rescuer roles, moral hero/villain characterization

## **Usage Guidelines**

### **Appropriate Text Types**
- Political speeches and statements
- Policy documents and arguments  
- Social commentary and opinion pieces
- Campaign materials and manifestos
- Legislative debates and justifications

### **Analysis Metrics**
- **Individualizing Score**: Care + Fairness foundation strength
- **Binding Score**: Loyalty + Authority + Sanctity foundation strength  
- **Moral Diversity Index**: Breadth across all foundations
- **Political Profile**: Ratio indicating political orientation

## **Expert Consultation Status**

### **Methodological Enhancement for Academic Review**
- ✅ **Vulnerability Mitigation**: Systematic addressing of computational framework weaknesses
- ✅ **Multi-Layered Detection**: Enhanced beyond lexical reductionism for sophisticated analysis
- ✅ **Bias Prevention**: Neutral prompts preventing circular validation concerns

- **Proactive Enhancement**: Applied methodological guidance before review
- **Systematic Validation**: Pre-validation MFQ correlation study design
- **Academic Rigor**: Meeting peer review standards for hostile scrutiny
- **Collaborative Design**: Built for expert partnership rather than independent deployment
- **Transparency Standards**: Open-source commitment with complete replication package

## **Technical Integration**

### **System Compatibility**

- ✅ **Database Integration**: Full experimental tracking
- ✅ **Visualization**: Circular positioning and foundation profiles

### **Prompt Template Compatibility**
- `moral_foundations_v1.0`: Direct foundation analysis

- `hierarchical_analysis`: Multi-level moral reasoning

## **Enhanced Validation Studies**

### **Pre-Validation Protocol** (Before Framework Deployment)
1. **MFQ-30 Correlation Study**: n=500+ participants, target r > 0.6 overall (foundation-specific: Care r > 0.65, Fairness r > 0.60)
2. **Enhanced Detection Validation**: n=200 expert-coded comparison of keyword vs multi-layered detection
3. **Bias Mitigation Testing**: Counter-balanced prompts preventing circular validation
4. **Foundation Interaction Analysis**: Large-scale correlation matrix and PCA validation

### **Realistic Reliability Standards** (Adjusted Post-Expert Review)
- **Human-LLM Agreement**: Cohen's κ ≥ 0.65 minimum, κ ≥ 0.70 goal (literature-realistic)
- **Inter-Human Reliability**: κ ≥ 0.70 between expert coders (lowered from aspirational targets)
- **Test-Retest Reliability**: r ≥ 0.80 for temporal consistency 
- **Cross-LLM Consistency**: r ≥ 0.85 between different models (achievable baseline)

### **Academic Rigor Success Criteria**
- Pre-registered study protocols with transparent methodology
- Systematic validation addressing computational framework vulnerabilities
- Expert endorsement following rigorous methodological review
- Publication-quality documentation enabling community replication
