  Enhanced Moral Foundations Theory framework implementing Jonathan Haidt's research 
  with systematic methodological improvements for academic rigor. Features multi-layered 
  moral detection beyond lexical reductionism, empirically-derived weighting, 
  bias-neutral validation design, and pre-registered reliability standards. 
  Designed for collaborative academic research and peer review scrutiny.

# THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
# =============================================================================

theoretical_foundation:
  primary_sources:
    - "Haidt, J. (2012). The righteous mind: Why good people are divided by politics and religion."
    - "Graham, J., Haidt, J., Koleva, S., Motyl, M., Iyer, R., Wojcik, S., & Ditto, P. H. (2013). Moral foundations theory: The pragmatic validity of moral pluralism. Advances in experimental social psychology, 47, 55-130."
    - "Haidt, J., & Joseph, C. (2004). Intuitive ethics: How innately prepared intuitions generate culturally variable virtues. Daedalus, 133(4), 55-66."
  
  theoretical_approach: |
    Based on Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory which identifies innate psychological 
    foundations that cultures build upon to create diverse moral systems. Each foundation 
    represents an evolved psychological mechanism for addressing adaptive challenges 
    faced by humans living in groups.
  
  core_insight: |
    Human morality is based on several innate psychological foundations, not just care 
    and fairness. People across cultures and political affiliations differ in how much 
    they rely on each foundation.

  expert_role: |
    You are an expert in moral psychology and value analysis with deep knowledge 
    of how moral reasoning manifests in discourse across cultures and political 
    orientations. You specialize in identifying implicit moral frameworks.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Analyze the values, principles, and moral reasoning present in this text. 
    Identify what moral concerns are emphasized, what behaviors are praised or 
    criticized, and what underlying value systems guide the reasoning.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for patterns of moral reasoning including: protection of vulnerable 
    individuals, concerns about fair treatment, group loyalty and solidarity, 
    respect for authority and tradition, and spiritual or purity concerns. 
    Analyze both explicit statements and implicit moral assumptions.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Score moral dimensions based on textual evidence of value emphasis, using 
    0.0-1.0 scale with specific quotations supporting each assessment. Focus on 
    strength of moral concern rather than political affiliation predictions.
  
  enhanced_detection_instructions: |
    Beyond explicit moral vocabulary, identify: (1) Syntactic patterns like moral 
    imperatives and causal moral reasoning, (2) Metaphorical expressions of values, 
    (3) Narrative moral positioning and role assignments, (4) Agent-patient 
    structures revealing moral agency, (5) Collective identity construction patterns.
