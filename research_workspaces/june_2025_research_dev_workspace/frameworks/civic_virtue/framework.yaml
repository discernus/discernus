  Civic Virtue Framework analyzes moral dimensions of persuasive political discourse 
  through classical virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican theory. Identifies 
  dimensions that strengthen or weaken democratic discourse and civic engagement using 
  clustered positioning around vertical moral hierarchy.

# THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
# =============================================================================

theoretical_foundation:
  primary_sources:
    - "Aristotle. Nicomachean Ethics. Book VI."
    - "Sandel, M. (2012). What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets."
  
  theoretical_approach: |
    Draws from classical virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican theory to 
    identify moral dimensions that strengthen or weaken democratic discourse and 
    civic engagement. Examines civic virtues and vices in political communication.
  
  core_insight: |
    Democratic discourse quality depends on presence of civic virtues (dignity, truth, 
    justice, hope, pragmatism) versus civic vices (tribalism, fear, resentment, 
    manipulation, fantasy) in political communication.

# PROMPT INTEGRATION
# =============================================================================

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert in civic virtue theory and democratic discourse analysis, 
    specializing in classical virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican 
    theory with deep knowledge of moral dimensions in political communication.
  
  analysis_focus: |
    Evaluate how political discourse demonstrates civic virtues (dignity, truth, 
    justice, hope, pragmatism) versus civic vices (tribalism, fear, resentment, 
    manipulation, fantasy) that affect democratic discourse quality.
  
  scoring_approach: |
    Score each well on 0.0-1.0 scale based on presence/strength of civic 
    virtue or vice in the text, with specific textual evidence.
  
  scoring_emphasis: |
    Assess civic virtue and vice positioning within each cluster, considering how 
    different moral dimensions manifest in political communication and their 
    impact on democratic discourse quality.
  
  evidence_requirements: |
    Provide specific textual evidence supporting each well score, explaining how 
    language patterns reflect underlying civic virtue or vice assumptions and 
    their effect on democratic participation.
