  Civic Virtue - A specialized Discernus Coordinates framework analyzing the tension 
  between civic engagement and civic disengagement in political discourse. This framework 
  examines how discourse either promotes active citizenship and democratic participation 
  or reflects withdrawal from civic life and democratic responsibilities.

      name: "Civic_Engagement"
      description: |
        Promotes active citizenship, democratic participation, community involvement, 
        and civic responsibility. Emphasizes the importance of citizen engagement 
        in democratic governance and community life.

# THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
# =============================================================================

theoretical_foundation:
  primary_sources:
    - "Aristotle. Nicomachean Ethics and Politics."
    - "Putnam, R. D. (2000). Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community."
    - "Tocqueville, A. de. Democracy in America."
  theoretical_approach: |
    This framework draws on civic republican tradition and social capital theory 
    to analyze how discourse either strengthens or weakens civic bonds and democratic 
    participation. It examines the balance between civic engagement and disengagement 
    in political communication.

# ANALYSIS METRICS

metrics:
  civic_axis_score:
    name: "Civic Axis Score"
    description: "Position on engagement-disengagement axis from integrative (+1) to disintegrative (-1)"
    calculation: "Civic Engagement score minus Civic Disengagement score"

    calculation: "Absolute value of axis score"

# =============================================================================
# PROMPT CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert analyst of civic life and democratic participation, with deep 
    knowledge of civic republican theory and social capital research. You specialize 
    in analyzing how discourse either promotes or undermines civic engagement.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Evaluate how the text either promotes civic engagement and democratic participation 
    OR reflects civic disengagement and democratic withdrawal. Focus specifically on 
    attitudes toward citizen responsibilities, democratic institutions, and community involvement.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for patterns that either encourage active citizenship and civic participation 
    or express cynicism about democratic institutions and civic life. Analyze both 
    explicit calls for engagement and implicit assumptions about civic duty.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Score civic orientations based on textual evidence, using 0.0-1.0 scale with 
    specific quotations supporting each assessment. Focus on civic frameworks rather 
    than specific policy positions.
