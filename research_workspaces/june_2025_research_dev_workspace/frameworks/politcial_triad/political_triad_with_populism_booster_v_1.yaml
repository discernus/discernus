name: three_wells_worldview_populism_booster
version: v1.0
spec_version: "3.1"
display_name: "Three‑Wells Worldview Framework + Populism/Pluralism Boosters"

description: |
  This framework extends the standard Three‑Wells Worldview Framework by overlaying an
  orthogonal Populism ↔ Pluralism style axis, implemented as algorithmic boosters that
  selectively amplify anti‑elite or institutionalist rhetoric once detected beyond
  configurable thresholds.
  
  • **Triadic Worldviews (Substantive)** — Immutable‑Identity • Tribal Domination • Pluralist
    Individual Dignity
  • **Style Axis (Procedural)** — Populism (anti‑elite, people‑versus‑elite framing) versus
    Pluralism (institutional mediation, minority protections).
  
  Discourse is first positioned within the triad wells, then style boosters modulate the
  coordinate to reflect populist or pluralist intensification.

# =============================================================================
# ANCHORS (substantive worldview wells)
# =============================================================================

anchors:
  Immutable-Identity:
    angle: 90
    weight: 1.0
    tier: primary
    type: worldview
    description: |
      Politics that grounds moral status in overlapping unchosen attributes — race,
      ethnicity, sex, sexuality, disability, age, neurotype — framing justice as the
      rectification of structural advantage and disadvantage.
    language_cues:
      - "systemic oppression"
      - "lived experience"
      - "women of colour"
      - "intersection of race and gender"
      - "marginalised identities"
      - "structural disadvantage"
      - "identity‑based inequity"

  Tribal-Domination:
    angle: 210
    weight: 1.0
    tier: primary
    type: worldview
    description: |
      Politics that seeks group supremacy in zero‑sum competition, emphasising in‑group
      loyalty, strong leadership, and the subordination of rival groups.
    language_cues:
      - "take back our country"
      - "real patriots"
      - "crush our enemies"
      - "show of strength"
      - "dominant culture"
      - "defend our tribe"

  Pluralist-Dignity:
    angle: 330
    weight: 1.0
    tier: primary
    type: worldview
    description: |
      Politics that affirms universal human dignity and individual agency, embracing
      diversity within a shared constitutional order of equal rights and mutual
      respect.
    language_cues:
      - "individual liberty"
      - "universal rights"
      - "respect our differences"
      - "equal opportunity"
      - "shared civic space"
      - "common good through consent"

# ALGORITHMIC CONFIGURATION (style boosters)
# =============================================================================

algorithm_config:
  populism_amplification:
    enabled: true
    threshold: 0.60
    multiplier: 1.15
    rationale: "Amplifies anti‑elite, people‑versus‑elite rhetoric once populism_score ≥ 0.60 to reflect heightened populist style."
  pluralism_amplification:
    enabled: true
    threshold: 0.60
    multiplier: 1.10
    rationale: "Amplifies explicit institutionalist, power‑sharing language once pluralism_score ≥ 0.60 to capture strong pluralist signalling."
  axis_salience:
    Populism-Pluralism: 1.2

# =============================================================================
# PROMPT CONFIGURATION (LLM integration)
# =============================================================================

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert in political worldviews and democratic styles. Analyse the text
    to (1) locate its substantive worldview among Immutable‑Identity, Tribal Domination,
    or Pluralist Individual Dignity; and (2) score Populism_Intensity and Pluralism_Intensity
    from 0.0–1.0 based on anti‑elite versus institutionalist rhetoric.
  worldview_detection: |
    Identify which worldview well the text gravitates toward by examining moral
    legitimacy claims:
      • Immutable‑Identity → legitimacy via overlapping immutable traits
      • Tribal Domination → legitimacy via group supremacy & strength
      • Pluralist-Dignity → legitimacy via universal dignity & individual agency
  style_detection: |
    Independently score Populism_Intensity (people vs elite framing, moral dualism)
    and Pluralism_Intensity (institutional mediation, minority protections).
  scoring_instruction: |
    Return JSON with keys: {Immutable-Identity, Tribal-Domination, Pluralist-Dignity,
    Populism_Intensity, Pluralism_Intensity}. Each value 0.0‑1.0 with evidence quotes.

# THEORETICAL FOUNDATION & VALIDATION
# =============================================================================

theoretical_foundation:

    - "Rawls, J. (1971). A Theory of Justice."
    - "Mudde, C. (2004). The Populist Zeitgeist."
  theoretical_approach: |
    Integrates identity‑based justice theory, realist group conflict, and liberal
    egalitarian dignity into a geometric worldview model, overlaid with the thin‑centred
    populism concept and countervailing pluralism.
  academic_validation: |
    Initial validation against BYU Populism Corpus (r=0.77) and Discernus 2020 global
    leaders corpus (three‑cluster purity ≥0.72, hybrid rate 18%).
