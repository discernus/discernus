display_name: "Political Worldview Triad Framework"

description: |
  Triadic worldview mapping framework within the Discernus Coordinate System (DCS).
  It scores political discourse along three distinct sources of legitimacy—Immutable-Identity,
  Tribal Domination, and Pluralist Individual Dignity—without any style overlays.
  
  ## Theoretical Foundation
  
  This framework operationalizes three fundamental sources of political legitimacy:
  
  1. **Immutable-Identity Politics**: Grounds moral status in overlapping unchosen attributes
     (race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, neurotype), viewing these
     traits as primary determinants of advantage or oppression.
  
  2. **Tribal Domination Politics**: Asserts legitimacy through in-group supremacy, security,
     or domination over out-groups, often framed in zero-sum or survivalist terms.
  
  3. **Pluralist Individual Dignity Politics**: Locates legitimacy in transcendent dignity
     and agency of each person, balancing universal civic equality with respectful
     acknowledgement of immutable traits.
  
  ## Usage Guidelines
  
  This framework is designed for analysis of contemporary political discourse where
  legitimacy claims center on group membership, cultural dominance, or individual
  dignity. Best applied to speeches, manifestos, policy documents, and social media
  content from 2010-2025.
  
  **Scoring Interpretation:**
  - 0.70-1.00: Strong attraction to worldview anchor
  - 0.40-0.69: Moderate attraction to worldview anchor  
  - 0.00-0.39: Weak or no attraction to worldview anchor
  
  ## Version History
  
  v1.0: Initial implementation with three-anchor worldview analysis, algorithm
  configuration, and academic validation framework.

  theoretical_approach: |
    This framework synthesizes three major traditions in political theory:
    
    1. **Critical Theory Tradition**: Draws from Crenshaw's intersectionality framework
       to understand how overlapping identity categories create distinct political
       experiences and legitimacy claims.
    
    2. **Realist Political Theory**: Incorporates Machiavellian insights about group
       competition, power dynamics, and zero-sum political conflict as drivers of
       tribal domination politics.
    
    3. **Liberal Democratic Theory**: Builds on Kantian dignity concepts and Rawlsian
       justice theory to capture pluralist approaches that emphasize individual
       agency within inclusive civic frameworks.
    
    The framework operationalizes these theoretical traditions through three
    independent anchors positioned at 120° intervals, enabling measurement of
    political discourse along each dimension without presuming mutual exclusivity.

    This framework synthesizes intersectionality theory (Crenshaw), realist political
    theory (Machiavelli), and liberal dignity theory (Kant) into a triangular
    measurement space for contemporary political discourse analysis.
