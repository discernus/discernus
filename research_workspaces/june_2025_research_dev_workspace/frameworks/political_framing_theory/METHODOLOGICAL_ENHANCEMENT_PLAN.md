# Political Framing Theory: Methodological Enhancement Plan

**Response to Academic Review**  
**Date:** June 19, 2025  
**Status:** Critical Methodological Repair Phase  
**Objective:** Address fundamental vulnerabilities identified in expert review  

## Review Summary

An expert reviewer identified our PFT framework as "academically ambitious but presently brittle" with solid theoretical foundations but serious methodological gaps that would not survive peer review. This document outlines systematic repairs to achieve academic rigor.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Identified

### **1. Independence Assumption Not Demonstrated**
**Problem**: Entman framework hard-codes 0.3 correlation cutoff without empirical validation  
**Risk**: If functions systematically co-activate, metric collapses  
**Academic Impact**: Reviewers will demand proof of independence before accepting framework  

### **2. Lexical Cue Reductionism**
**Problem**: Over-reliance on surface phrases vs sophisticated indirect framing  
**Risk**: Missing high-level metaphors, over-firing on boilerplate  
**Academic Impact**: Sophisticated political prose analysis appears superficial  

### **3. LLM Bias and Self-Priming**
**Problem**: Model confirming what prompts prime it to find  
**Risk**: Circular validation undermining results credibility  
**Academic Impact**: Entire methodology questioned as biased  

### **4. Undefined Human-LLM Comparability**
**Problem**: No reliability targets (κ ≥ 0.75), no adjudication procedures  
**Risk**: "Human check" becomes cosmetic validation  
**Academic Impact**: Reviewers dismiss as methodologically unsound  

### **5. Arbitrary Geometric Thresholds**
**Problem**: Clustering coefficients (0.7) and thresholds (0.3) without justification  
**Risk**: Critics demand empirical or theoretical basis  
**Academic Impact**: Undermines quantitative analysis credibility  

### **6. Cognitive vs Communicative Level Confusion**
**Problem**: Mixing "frames in thought" (Lakoff) and "frames in communication" (Entman)  
**Risk**: Muddy causal inference, theoretical confusion  
**Academic Impact**: Fundamental conceptual errors prevent publication  

## Systematic Methodological Repairs

### **Phase 1: Empirical Foundation Building (Months 1-2)**

**Success Criteria**:
- Human-LLM κ ≥ 0.75 across all framework components
- Inter-human reliability κ ≥ 0.80
- Test-retest reliability r ≥ 0.85

#### **3.2 Predictive Validation**
**Objective**: Demonstrate framework utility beyond description  

**Method**:
- Known-groups validation (texts with established frame differences)
- Temporal prediction (frame patterns predicting future messaging)
- Cross-issue prediction (frame consistency across policy domains)
- Comparative validation against established measures

**Success Criteria**:
- Known-groups differentiation with effect sizes d > 0.8
- Predictive accuracy > 70% for temporal patterns
- Cross-issue consistency r > 0.6

#### **3.3 Robustness Testing**
**Objective**: Demonstrate framework stability across conditions  

**Method**:
- Cross-cultural validation (non-US political contexts)
- Multimodal testing (text + image + video analysis)
- Temporal stability (consistent results across different time periods)
- Genre robustness (speeches, social media, news, policy documents)

**Success Criteria**:
- Cross-cultural replication of core patterns
- Multimodal consistency r > 0.7
- Temporal stability r > 0.8

### **Phase 4: Academic Integration (Months 7-8)**

## Conclusion

This methodological enhancement plan transforms our PFT framework from "academically ambitious but presently brittle" to academically rigorous and peer-review ready. By systematically addressing each identified vulnerability, we create a framework capable of withstanding hostile review while maintaining theoretical sophistication.

The enhanced framework will demonstrate that computational political framing analysis can meet the highest academic standards while providing genuine insights into political discourse. This positions our work as methodological infrastructure for the broader research community rather than just another AI tool making unsupported claims.

**Next Action**: Begin Phase 1 empirical foundation studies to replace assumptions with evidence-based methodology.
