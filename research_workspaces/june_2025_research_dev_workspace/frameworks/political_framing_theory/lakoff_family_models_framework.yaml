  Lakoff Family Models Framework tests George Lakoff's family model coherence hypothesis 
  through three dipoles with arc clustering analysis. Implements Strict Father vs 
  Nurturant Parent worldview components as independent dipoles positioned in predicted 
  arc clusters to empirically validate cognitive linguistics theory through circular geometry.

  primary_sources:
    - "Lakoff, G. (1996). Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think. University of Chicago Press."
    - "Lakoff, G. (2002). Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think (2nd ed.). University of Chicago Press."

  theoretical_approach: |
    Tests Lakoff's family model coherence hypothesis through computational analysis 
    and circular geometry. Examines whether political communications actually follow 
    predicted clustering patterns where Strict Father components (Authority/Discipline, 
    Competition/Hierarchy, Self-Reliance) cluster together and oppose Nurturant Parent 
    components (Empathy/Communication, Cooperation/Mutual Support, Interdependence).
  
  core_insight: |
    Political worldviews stem from coherent family models that generate consistent 
    positions across issues. This framework provides the first quantitative test 
    of whether family model components actually cluster as Lakoff's theory predicts.

  integration_research: |
    Based on Chong & Druckman's finding that this addresses "frames in thought" 
    (deep cognitive structures) as distinct from "frames in communication" 
    (systematic message construction).

# PROMPT INTEGRATION
# =============================================================================

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert in cognitive linguistics and political psychology, specializing 
    in George Lakoff's family model theory and political framing analysis. You have 
    deep knowledge of how Strict Father and Nurturant Parent worldviews manifest 
    in political discourse through specific language patterns and conceptual metaphors.
  
  analysis_focus: |
    Analyze this text to identify components of Lakoff's family models: Authority/Discipline, 
    Competition/Hierarchy, Self-Reliance (Strict Father) versus Empathy/Communication, 
    Cooperation/Mutual Support, Interdependence (Nurturant Parent). Test whether these 
    components cluster as predicted by family model theory.
  
  scoring_approach: |
    Score each dipole pole on 0.0-1.0 scale based on presence/strength of family 
    model components in the text, with specific textual evidence supporting 
    clustering hypothesis testing.
  
  scoring_emphasis: |
    Focus on detecting family model coherence patterns. Look for co-activation 
    of Strict Father components (Authority/Discipline + Competition/Hierarchy + 
    Self-Reliance) or Nurturant Parent components (Empathy/Communication + 
    Cooperation/Mutual Support + Interdependence) as predicted by theory.
  
  evidence_requirements: |
    Provide specific textual evidence for each dipole score, explaining how 
    language patterns reflect family model assumptions. Note any coherence 
    violations where opposing family model components appear together.

    clustering_awareness:
