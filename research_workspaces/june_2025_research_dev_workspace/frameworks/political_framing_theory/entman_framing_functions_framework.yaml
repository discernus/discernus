  Entman Framing Functions Framework implements Robert Entman's systematic communication 
  analysis through four independent framing functions. Tests whether Problem Definition, 
  Causal Attribution, Moral Evaluation, and Treatment Recommendation operate independently 
  as predicted by communication theory, representing "frames in communication" systematic 
  message construction.

  theoretical_approach: |
    Tests Entman's systematic communication analysis theory that framing operates through 
    four distinct, independent functions that can vary separately. Examines whether political 
    communications actually demonstrate function independence and how strategic message 
    construction utilizes different combinations of framing functions.
  
  core_insight: |
    Political frames operate through systematic communication processes involving selection 
    and salience across four essential functions. Each function can be present or absent 
    independently, creating sophisticated patterns of strategic communication.

  integration_research: |
    Based on Chong & Druckman's finding that this addresses "frames in communication" 
    (systematic message construction) as distinct from "frames in thought" 
    (deep cognitive structures).

  entman_four_functions: |
    "Framing essentially involves selection and salience. To frame is to select some 
    aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, 
    in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, 
    moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation."

    All four framing functions are equally important in Entman's theory and should 
    be able to vary independently. Equal weighting tests theoretical prediction 
    that no single function dominates systematic communication.

# PROMPT INTEGRATION
# =============================================================================

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert in communication theory and political framing analysis, specializing 
    in Robert Entman's systematic communication analysis and framing function theory. You have 
    deep knowledge of how Problem Definition, Causal Attribution, Moral Evaluation, and 
    Treatment Recommendation manifest in political communications as independent analytical dimensions.
  
  analysis_focus: |
    Analyze this text to identify Entman's four framing functions: Problem Definition 
    (what issues require attention), Causal Attribution (what/who caused problems), 
    Moral Evaluation (what values/judgments apply), and Treatment Recommendation 
    (what solutions are proposed). Assess each function independently.
  
  scoring_approach: |
    Score each function well on 0.0-1.0 scale based on presence/strength of that 
    specific framing function in the text, with specific textual evidence. Functions 
    operate independently - text can score high on all functions simultaneously.
  
  scoring_emphasis: |
    Focus on systematic communication analysis. Look for strategic use of framing 
    functions, frame competition (conflicting problem definitions or solutions), 
    and message completeness (which functions are present/absent). Assess 
    communication sophistication and strategic message construction.
  
  evidence_requirements: |
    Provide specific textual evidence for each function score, explaining how 
    language patterns demonstrate systematic framing. Note frame competition, 
    function combinations, and strategic communication patterns.
