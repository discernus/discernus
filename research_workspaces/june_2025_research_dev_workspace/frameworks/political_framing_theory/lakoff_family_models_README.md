# Lakoff Family Models Framework - Political Framing Theory

## Framework Overview

**Name**: `lakoff_family_models`  
**Version**: v2025.06.17  
**Framework Type**: Arc Clustered Dipoles  
**Author Focus**: George Lakoff's Family Model Theory  

### Theoretical Foundation

This framework implements George Lakoff's family model coherence hypothesis through computational analysis and circular geometry. Based on Lakoff's groundbreaking work in *Moral Politics* (1996, 2002), it tests whether political communications actually follow predicted clustering patterns where **Strict Father** components cluster together and oppose **Nurturant Parent** components.

### Core Innovation: Arc Clustering Hypothesis Testing

The framework represents the **first quantitative test** of whether family model components actually cluster as Lakoff's theory predicts through:

- **Strict Father Arc** (315° to 45°): Authority/Discipline, Competition/Hierarchy, Self-Reliance
- **Nurturant Parent Arc** (135° to 225°): Empathy/Communication, Cooperation/Mutual Support, Interdependence

### Three Dipoles Architecture

#### Dipole 1: Authority/Discipline ↔ Empathy/Communication (Primary - Weight 1.0)
- **Authority/Discipline** (315°): Strong moral authority, clear discipline, hierarchical decision-making
- **Empathy/Communication** (135°): Empathetic understanding, inclusive dialogue, communication-based problem solving

#### Dipole 2: Competition/Hierarchy ↔ Cooperation/Mutual Support (Secondary - Weight 0.9)  
- **Competition/Hierarchy** (0°): Natural hierarchy, merit-based competition, individual achievement
- **Cooperation/Mutual Support** (180°): Egalitarian cooperation, shared responsibility, collective problem-solving

#### Dipole 3: Self-Reliance ↔ Interdependence (Secondary - Weight 0.8)
- **Self-Reliance** (45°): Individual responsibility, self-determination, personal accountability  
- **Interdependence** (225°): Collective responsibility, social connection, mutual dependence

## Key Research Questions Enabled

### 1. Family Model Coherence Testing
**Question**: Do political texts that score high on Authority/Discipline also score high on Competition/Hierarchy and Self-Reliance as Lakoff predicts?  
**Method**: Statistical correlation analysis across family model components  
**Success Criteria**: Strong positive correlations within family model clusters  

### 2. Arc Clustering Validation
**Question**: Do the six dipole poles actually cluster geographically as predicted by family model theory?  
**Method**: Geometric clustering analysis using circular coordinates  
**Success Criteria**: Geographic clustering matches theoretical predictions  

### 3. Coherence Violation Detection
**Question**: What percentage of political texts violate family model predictions by mixing Strict Father and Nurturant Parent language patterns?  
**Method**: Coherence violation detection algorithms  
**Success Criteria**: Identification and categorization of mixed messaging patterns  

### 4. Cross-Issue Worldview Consistency
**Question**: Do political figures maintain consistent family model clustering patterns across different policy domains?  
**Method**: Cross-issue correlation analysis of family model positioning  
**Success Criteria**: Consistent clustering patterns across economic, social, foreign policy domains  

### 5. Predictive Worldview Analysis
**Question**: Can family model positioning on known issues predict positions on new/emerging political issues?  
**Method**: Predictive modeling using family model scores  
**Success Criteria**: Successful prediction of positions on new issues from family model patterns

## Prompt Integration Strategy

### Expert Role Configuration
The framework positions the LLM as an expert in **cognitive linguistics and political psychology**, specializing in George Lakoff's family model theory and political framing analysis, with deep knowledge of how Strict Father and Nurturant Parent worldviews manifest through specific language patterns and conceptual metaphors.

### Clustering-Aware Analysis
The prompt specifically instructs the LLM to:
- Look for **co-activation patterns** within each family model
- Test whether **Strict Father components cluster**: Authority/Discipline + Competition/Hierarchy + Self-Reliance  
- Test whether **Nurturant Parent components cluster**: Empathy/Communication + Cooperation/Mutual Support + Interdependence
- Note **coherence violations** where opposing family model components appear together
- Consider **conceptual metaphors** that reveal underlying family model assumptions

## Visualization Features

### Arc Cluster Visualization
- **Predicted Arc Boundaries**: Dashed lines showing theoretical clustering zones
- **Cluster Color Coding**: Blue for Strict Father, Green for Nurturant Parent components
- **Clustering Coefficient Display**: Visual indicators of clustering success/failure
- **Coherence Violation Highlighting**: Visual markers for mixed messaging detection

### Advanced Metrics Display
- **Center of Mass Indicators**: Overall family model orientation
- **Arc Separation Measurements**: Quantitative distance visualization
- **Clustering Hypothesis Overlay**: Theoretical predictions vs actual results
- **Family Model Coherence Scoring**: Visual consistency indicators

## Research Applications

### Political Communication Analysis
- **Campaign Message Analysis**: Test family model consistency across campaign communications
- **Policy Position Prediction**: Use family model positioning to predict stances on new issues
- **Cross-Party Comparison**: Compare family model usage across political parties and figures
