# Entman Framing Functions Framework - Political Framing Theory

## Framework Overview

**Name**: `entman_framing_functions`  
**Version**: v2025.06.17  
**Framework Type**: Independent Wells  
**Author Focus**: Robert Entman's Systematic Communication Analysis  

### Theoretical Foundation

This framework implements Robert Entman's systematic communication analysis through four independent framing functions. Based on Entman's foundational work in framing theory (1993, 2007), it tests whether **Problem Definition**, **Causal Attribution**, **Moral Evaluation**, and **Treatment Recommendation** operate independently as predicted by communication theory, representing "frames in communication" systematic message construction.

### Core Innovation: Function Independence Testing

The framework represents a **systematic test** of whether framing functions actually operate as independent analytical dimensions through:

- **Equal 90° Spacing**: Functions positioned at 0°, 90°, 180°, 270° to test independence
- **No Correlation Assumptions**: Equal weighting without predicted relationships
- **Strategic Pattern Detection**: Identification of systematic vs ad hoc framing usage

### Four Independent Wells Architecture

#### Well 1: Problem Definition (North - 0°)
**Entman's Question**: "What issues are identified as requiring attention?"  
**Analysis Focus**: How problems are conceptualized, bounded, and prioritized  
**Language Indicators**: Issue identification, problem scope, urgency framing, conceptualization patterns

#### Well 2: Causal Attribution (East - 90°)
**Entman's Question**: "What factors/actors are presented as causing problems?"  
**Analysis Focus**: Assignment of responsibility, blame, and causal mechanisms  
**Language Indicators**: Actor responsibility, systemic causes, historical causation, causal mechanisms

#### Well 3: Moral Evaluation (South - 180°)
**Entman's Question**: "What values and moral judgments are invoked?"  
**Analysis Focus**: Values invocation, ethical evaluation, and moral frameworks  
**Language Indicators**: Value invocation, moral judgment, ethical frameworks, moral evaluation

#### Well 4: Treatment Recommendation (West - 270°)
**Entman's Question**: "What solutions are proposed or endorsed?"  
**Analysis Focus**: Solution advocacy, policy specificity, and action recommendations  
**Language Indicators**: Solution advocacy, policy specificity, action urgency, recommendation strength

## Entman's Foundational Definition

> "Framing essentially involves selection and salience. To frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation."

This framework operationalizes this definition by treating each function as an independent analytical dimension that can be present or absent in varying strengths.
