# Populism vs Pluralism Dipole Framework - Discernus Worldview Axis
# Developed from BYU Global Populism Dataset and ideological populism theory (Mudde, Hawkins)
# Integrated into Discernus dipole-based worldview scoring system

description: |
  This framework encodes the ideological tension between populist and pluralist worldviews, grounded in 
  the theoretical work of Hawkins, Mudde, Rovira Kaltwasser, and the BYU Global Populism project. It 
  formalizes the populist–pluralist axis as a coherent dipole usable in large language model scoring, 
  worldview clustering, and rhetorical diagnostics. The populist pole emphasizes moral dualism, 
  anti-elitism, and people-centric sovereignty, while the pluralist pole emphasizes institutional 
  legitimacy, value pluralism, and democratic competition.

theoretical_foundation:
  primary_sources:
    - "Hawkins, K. A., Carlin, R. E., Littvay, L., & Rovira Kaltwasser, C. (2019). The Ideational Approach to Populism: Concept, Theory, and Analysis. Routledge."

  theoretical_approach: |
    Operationalizes populism as a moralistic ideology distinguishing a pure, virtuous people from a 
    corrupt elite, promoting popular sovereignty as the sole legitimate authority. Contrasts this with 
    pluralism, which treats society as composed of multiple legitimate groups in dynamic institutional 
    balance. This framework adapts BYU's holistic scoring method into a structured dipole for 
    interpretability and LLM scaling.

dipole:
  name: Populism_vs_Pluralism
  description: "Ideological tension between populist and pluralist worldviews in democratic discourse"

  positive:
    name: Populism
    description: "Moral dualism, people-centric sovereignty, anti-elitism, and rejection of institutional pluralism"
    
    rich_description: |
      Frames politics as a struggle between a virtuous, unified "people" and a corrupt, self-serving 
      "elite." Emphasizes direct popular will over representative institutions, often casting political 
      opponents as illegitimate. Rejects compromise, favors absolute moral clarity, and frequently 
      invokes a sense of systemic betrayal or conspiracy.
    
    language_cues:
      - the real Americans
      - the corrupt elite
      - rigged system
      - only I can fix it
      - the people have spoken
      - betrayed by the establishment
      - take back control
      - they don’t care about you
      - the forgotten men and women
      - fight for the people
      - drain the swamp
      - shut down the system

    weight: 1.0
    type: populist
    tier: primary

  negative:
    name: Pluralism
    description: "Institutional trust, group legitimacy, democratic competition, and norm-bound political diversity"
    
    rich_description: |
      Treats society as composed of multiple legitimate constituencies with competing interests. 
      Emphasizes procedural democracy, institutional checks and balances, and the legitimacy of political 
      disagreement. Values compromise, dialogue, and institutional continuity. Rejects Manichaean framing 
      in favor of issue complexity and shared governance.
    
    language_cues:
      - different voices matter
      - respect the democratic process
      - checks and balances
      - legitimate disagreement
      - inclusive institutions
      - protect the rule of law
      - governing together
      - preserve our democracy
      - trust in democratic norms
      - working through the system
      - political pluralism
      - competing ideas strengthen democracy

    weight: -1.0

# PROMPT CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are a political discourse analyst specializing in ideological populism and pluralism, 
    trained using the BYU Global Populism Dataset and the ideational theory of populism. You 
    recognize moral framing, anti-elitism, and people-centrism as core features of populist rhetoric, 
    and institutional trust and diversity-of-view as core to pluralism.

  analysis_focus: |
    Analyze this text for evidence of populist or pluralist worldview. Identify whether the speaker 
    frames politics in moral binaries, elevates the "people" above institutions, and vilifies elites 
    (populism), or affirms democratic institutions, political pluralism, and respectful disagreement (pluralism).

  scoring_approach: |
    Score on a -1.0 to +1.0 scale:
      +1.0 = highly populist
      0.0 = neutral or mixed
      -1.0 = highly pluralist

    Include evidence for both sides, noting contradiction if both poles are invoked in tension.

  evidence_requirements: |
    Quote or paraphrase specific text passages supporting each end of the dipole. If both appear 
    in close proximity, flag as worldview contradiction. Note dominant pole and intensity.
