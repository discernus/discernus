# Three Theories Political Discourse Framework Documentation

**Contemporary Political Theory Analysis (2010-present)**

## Overview

The Three Theories Political framework analyzes contemporary political discourse through three independent, competing gravitational wells that transcend traditional left-right categories. This **non-dipole framework** represents three fundamentally incompatible worldviews about human nature, social organization, and political legitimacy.

## Framework Type: **Non-Dipole Independent Wells**

Unlike dipole-based frameworks (MFT, IDITI), this framework uses **three independent wells** positioned at 120째 intervals, representing genuinely competing theories rather than opposing pairs.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Primary Sources
- **Three Gravitational Wells of Contemporary Political Discourse: An Integrative Analysis**

### Historical Context
- **Emergence Period**: 2010-present
- **Successor To**: Classical Liberal-Communist-Fascist Triangle (1900-1989)
- **Transition Period**: 1989-2010
- **Key Insight**: Contemporary politics organized around identity, dignity, and belonging questions rather than traditional economic redistribution

## Three Independent Wells

### 1. **Intersectionality Theory** (0째, Purple)
**Position**: [1.0, 0.0]  
**Core Focus**: Multiple overlapping identity categories and systemic oppression analysis

**Key Characteristics:**
- Treats individuals primarily through group membership
- Emphasizes structural inequality and group-based remedies
- Coalition building across marginalized groups
- Group-conscious policies and demographic representation

**Language Patterns:**
- "lived experience," "marginalized communities," "systemic racism"
- "targeted programs," "demographic equity," "historical injustices"

### 2. **Tribal Domination Theory** (120째, Red)
**Position**: [-0.5, 0.866]  
**Core Focus**: In-group loyalty and out-group exclusion with dominance seeking

**Key Characteristics:**
- Group supremacy and flexible tribal boundaries
- Loyalty over universal principles
- Exclusionary politics and cultural dominance
- Territory/institutional control seeking

**Language Patterns:**
- "our people first," "real Americans," "they don't belong"
- "group loyalty," "cultural invasion," "take back control"

### 3. **Pluralist Individual Dignity Theory** (240째, Blue)
**Position**: [-0.5, -0.866]  
**Core Focus**: Universal human dignity and cross-group cooperation

**Key Characteristics:**
- Individual moral agency and autonomy
- Merit-based institutions and equal treatment
- Bridging across group boundaries
- Civic cooperation and shared humanity

**Language Patterns:**
- "human dignity," "common humanity," "bring people together"
- "merit-based," "equal treatment," "civic engagement"

## Framework Comparison Benefits

### **Dipole vs. Non-Dipole Validation**
This framework enables comparative validation studies against dipole frameworks:

**Dipole Frameworks** (MFT, IDITI):
- Binary opposition structure
- Positive/negative weighting
- Moral hierarchy implied

**Non-Dipole Framework** (Three Wells):
- Independent competition model
- Equal weighting across all wells
- No inherent moral hierarchy

### **Experimental Design Advantages**
- **Same Corpus Analysis**: Can analyze identical texts with both framework types
- **Methodological Comparison**: Tests dipole vs. independent wells approaches
- **Academic Validation**: Demonstrates framework flexibility and robustness

## Analysis Focus

### **Primary Research Questions**
1. Which theoretical worldview drives the narrative's assumptions?
2. How does the text position individuals - as group representatives or autonomous agents?
3. Does the narrative promote integration or fragmentation of social bonds?
4. What are the long-term implications for democratic governance?

### **Analytical Distinctions**
- **Surface vs. Deep**: Policy positions vs. underlying theoretical commitments
- **Hybrid Recognition**: Narratives can show attraction to multiple wells
- **Temporal Evolution**: How political rhetoric evolves across the three theories

## Metrics & Measurement

### **Framework-Specific Metrics**
1. **Center of Mass**: Overall positioning across three theoretical worldviews
2. **Gravitational Pull Strength**: Total magnitude of theoretical forces
3. **Theoretical Coherence Score**: Consistency with single theory vs. mixed pulls

### **Comparative Analysis**
- **vs. Dipole Frameworks**: Different mathematical structure enables methodological comparison
- **Temporal Tracking**: Evolution of political discourse from 2010-present
- **Cross-Cultural**: Application to political discourse beyond US context

## Academic Applications

### **Research Opportunities**
- **Framework Validation**: Comparison with established political science measures
- **Methodological Studies**: Dipole vs. independent wells effectiveness
- **Discourse Evolution**: Temporal analysis of political language change
- **Cross-Cultural Analysis**: International political discourse patterns

### **Publication Targets**
- Computational Social Science journals
- Political Psychology publications
- Methodology and measurement studies
- Democratic theory and discourse analysis

## Validation Status
