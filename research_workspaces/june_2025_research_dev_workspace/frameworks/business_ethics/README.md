# Business Ethics Framework

**Version:** v2025.06.17  
**Status:** Production Ready  
**Framework Type:** Clustered Dipoles  

## Overview

The Business Ethics Framework analyzes business communications across three domains of ethical concern: stakeholder relationships, operational integrity, and strategic vision. This framework implements stakeholder-based ethical analysis with domain-specific clustering, demonstrating flexible dipole organization within defined business ethics arcs.

## Theoretical Foundation

Based on Freeman's Stakeholder Theory and Solomon's business ethics research, this framework focuses on three critical domains of business responsibility:

- **Freeman, R.E. (1984).** Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach
- **Solomon, R.C. (1992).** Ethics and Excellence: Cooperation and Integrity in Business

## Framework Structure

### Three Domain Clusters

#### 1. Stakeholder Relations (Upper-Right Quadrant)
**Arc Range:** 15° - 75° | **Weight:** 40%
- **Customer Relations:** Service vs. Exploitation
- **Employee Relations:** Development vs. Exploitation

#### 2. Operational Integrity (Left Quadrant)  
**Arc Range:** 120° - 210° | **Weight:** 40%
- **Governance Transparency:** Accountability vs. Opacity
- **Financial Integrity:** Responsibility vs. Manipulation

#### 3. Strategic Vision (Lower-Right Quadrant)
**Arc Range:** 270° - 360° | **Weight:** 20%
- **Strategic Purpose:** Sustainable Purpose vs. Short-term Extraction

## Dipoles Summary

| Dipole | Positive Pole | Negative Pole | Weight | Tier |
|--------|---------------|---------------|---------|------|
| Customer Relations | Customer Service | Customer Exploitation | 1.0 | Primary |
| Employee Relations | Employee Development | Employee Exploitation | 0.9 | Secondary |
| Governance Transparency | Accountability | Opacity | 0.8 | Secondary |
| Financial Integrity | Financial Responsibility | Financial Manipulation | 0.8 | Secondary |
| Strategic Purpose | Sustainable Purpose | Short-term Extraction | 0.7 | Tertiary |

## Key Features

### Clustered Architecture
- Dipoles are organized into domain-specific clusters
- Each cluster represents distinct ethical concerns in business communications
- Cluster-weighted center of mass calculation accounts for domain structure

### Ethical Language Detection
- Comprehensive language cue patterns for each pole
- Domain-specific terminology recognition
- Stakeholder vs. shareholder orientation identification

### Visualization Support
- Color-coded cluster boundaries with visual arc indicators
- Domain-specific color scheme (Green/Blue/Orange)
- Integrative vs. disintegrative pole distinction

## Usage Guidelines

### Best Suited For
- Corporate communications analysis
- CSR and sustainability reporting evaluation
- Business ethics research and consultation
- Stakeholder communication assessment

### Expert Analysis Focus
The framework guides analysis across three key questions:
1. **Stakeholder Relations:** How does the communication treat customers and employees?
2. **Operational Integrity:** What governance and financial practices are emphasized?
3. **Strategic Vision:** What long-term purpose and sustainability commitment is demonstrated?

## Academic Validation

- **Theoretical Standard:** Stakeholder Theory and Business Ethics literature
- **Academic Foundation:** Freeman Stakeholder Approach
- **Key Principles:** 
  - Stakeholder capitalism over shareholder primacy
  - Transparent governance and accountability
  - Sustainable long-term value creation
  - Employee dignity and development
  - Customer service over exploitation

## Implementation Notes

### Calculation Method
Uses `clustered_dipole_center_of_mass` with domain-specific cluster weighting:
- Stakeholder Relations: 40%
- Operational Integrity: 40%  
- Strategic Vision: 20%

### Compatibility
- **Prompt Templates:** `clustered_dipoles_v1.0`, `business_ethics_v2.1`
- **API Versions:** v2.1
- **Visualization:** Circular, clustered display types

## Migration Notes

This framework was successfully migrated from JSON to YAML format as part of the unified asset management architecture implementation. All theoretical content, dipole definitions, and calculation methodologies have been preserved while adopting the standardized YAML format for improved readability and version control.
