# THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
# =============================================================================

theoretical_foundation:
  primary_sources:
    - "Freeman, R.E. (1984). Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach"
    - "Solomon, R.C. (1992). Ethics and Excellence: Cooperation and Integrity in Business"
  
  theoretical_approach: |
    Stakeholder-based ethical analysis focusing on three domains of business 
    responsibility clustered around specific arcs of analytical space. Each domain 
    represents distinct ethical concerns that businesses must navigate in their 
    communications and operations.
  
  core_insight: |
    Business ethics manifests across distinct domains (stakeholder relations, 
    operational integrity, strategic vision) that can be systematically analyzed 
    through clustered dipole positioning to reveal ethical orientation patterns.
