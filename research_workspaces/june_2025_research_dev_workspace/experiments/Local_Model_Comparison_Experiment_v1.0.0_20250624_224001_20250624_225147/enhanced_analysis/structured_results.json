Features the iconic closing line from John Gillespie Magee Jr.'s poem \"High Flight.\"\n\n---\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the State of the Union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans.\n\nToday is a day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss.\n\nNineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground. But we've never lost an astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle. But they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly.\n\nWe mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn their loss as a nation together.\n\nFor the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, \"Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy.\" They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve, and they did. They served all of us.\n\nWe've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for twenty-five years, the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.\n\nAnd I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them.\n\nI've always had great faith in and respect for our space program, and what happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our space program. We don't keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in public. That's the way freedom is, and we wouldn't change it for a minute.\n\nWe'll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.\n\nI want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA or who worked on this mission and tell them: \"Your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your anguish. We share it.\"\n\nThere's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, \"He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it.\" Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake's, complete.\n\nThe crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and \"slipped the surly bonds of earth\" to \"touch the face of God.\"\n\nThank you.",

Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Dick Durbin. You make us all proud. On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention.\n\nTonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance, my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.\n\nWhile studying here my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor, my grandfather signed up for duty. Joined the army, marched across Europe. Back home my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through F.H.A., and later moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity. And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter.\n\nA common dream born of two continents. My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, believing in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined -- they imagined me going to the best schools in the land even though they weren't rich because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential. They have both passed away now and yet I know that on this night they look down on me with great pride.\n\nThey stand here and I stand here today grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me and that in no other country on earth is my story even possible.\n\nTonight we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation. Not because of the height of our skyscrapers or the power of our military or the size of our economy, our pride is based on a very simple premise. Summed up in a declaration made over 200 years ago. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThat is the true genius of America. A faith in simple dreams. An insistence on small miracles. That we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. And we can say what we think, write what we think without hearing a sudden knock on the door, that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe, that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution and that our votes will be counted, at least most of the time.\n\nThis year in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forebears and the promise of future generations. Fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents, I say to you we have more work to do.\n\nMore work to do for the workers I met in Illinois who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico and now we're having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay $7 an hour, or the father I met that was losing his job and choking back the tears wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on. More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis and thousands more like her who has the grades, has the drive, has the will but doesn't have the money to go to college.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, the people I meet in small towns and big cities and diners and office parks, they don't expect government to solve all of their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to. Go into the counties around Chicago and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or by the Pentagon. Go into any inner city neighborhood and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn. They know the parents have to teach. The children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things.\n\nPeople don't expect government to solve all their problems but they sense deep in their bones that with just a slight change in priorities we could make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life. And that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better and they want that choice.\n\nIn this election we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer and that man is John Kerry. John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because they've defined his life from his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate. He has devoted himself to this country. Again and again we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home. John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves. John Kerry believes in energy independence so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties or use faith as a wedge to divide us. And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes but it should never be the first option.\n\nYou know, a while back -- a while back I met a young man in a V.F.W. hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, 6'2\", clear-eyed with an easy smile. He told me he joined the Marines and was headed to Iraq the following week. As I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service I thought this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child.\n\nBut then I asked myself, are we serving him as well as he's serving us? I thought of the 900 men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who won't be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families I met struggling to get by without a loved one's full income or whose loved one returned with a limb missing but still lack long-term health care benefits because they were reservists.\n\nWhen we send our young men and women into harm's way we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace and earn the respect of the world.\n\nNow let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued. And they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in America. And he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism there's another ingredient in the American saga. A belief that we're all connected as one people. If there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me even if it's not my child. If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription drugs and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer even if it's not my grandparent. If there's an Arab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process that threatens my civil liberties.\n\nIt is that fundamental belief -- it is that fundamental belief I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper that makes this country work. It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one American family. Out of many, one.\n\nNow even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight there is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America. There's the United States of America.\n\nThe pundits, the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states, red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats, but I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and, yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who oppose the war in Iraq and there are patriots who support the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.\n\nIn the end that's what this election is about. Do we participate in the politics of cynicism or in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here, the willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it or health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. That's not what I'm talking about.\n\nI'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs. The hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores. The hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta, the hope of a mill worker's son who dares to defy the odds, the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. Hope -- hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope.\n\nIn the end that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation, a belief in things not seen. A belief that there are better days ahead. I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with the road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs for the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that we have righteous wind at our backs and as we stand on the crossroads of history we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.\n\nAmerica, tonight if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine the people will rise up in November and John Kerry will be sworn in as president and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president and this country will reclaim its promise and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.",

This speech helped establish him as a key leader in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n---\n\n[Applause] We march today for jobs and freedom, but we have nothing to be proud of, for hundreds and thousands of our brothers are not here. They're receiving starvation wages or no wages at all. While we stand here, there are sharecroppers in the Delta of Mississippi who are out in the field working for less than three dollars a day, twelve hours a day. While we stand here, there are students in jail on trumped-up charges. Our brother James Farmer, along with many others, is also in jail.\n\nWe come here today with a great sense of misgiving. It is true that we support the administration's civil rights bill. We support it with great reservations, however. Unless Title Three is put in this bill, there's nothing to protect the young children and old women who must face police dogs and fire hoses in the South while they engage in peaceful demonstrations. In its present form, this bill will not protect the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear of a police state. It will not protect the hundreds and thousands of people who have been arrested upon trumped-up charges.\n\nWhat about the three young men - SNCC field secretaries in Americus, Georgia - who face the death penalty for engaging in peaceful protest? As it stands now, the voting section of this bill will not help the thousands of black people who want to vote. It will not help the citizens of Mississippi, of Alabama, and Georgia, who are qualified to vote but lack a sixth-grade education.\n\nWe must have legislation that will protect the Mississippi sharecropper who is put off of his farm because he dares to register to vote. We need a bill that will provide for the homeless and starving people of this nation. We need a bill to ensure the equality of a maid who earns five dollars a week in the home of a family whose total income is one hundred thousand dollars a year. We must have a good FEPC bill.\n\nMy friends, let us not forget that we are involved in a serious social revolution. By and large, American politics is dominated by politicians who build their careers on immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political, economic, and social exploitation. There are exceptions, of course - we salute those - but what political leader can stand up and say, \"My party is the party of principles\"? For the party of Kennedy is also the party of Eastland. The party of Javits is also the party of Goldwater.\n\nWhere is our party? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march on Washington? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march in the streets of Birmingham? Where is the political party that will protect the citizens of Albany, Georgia? Do you know that in Albany, Georgia, nine of our leaders have been indicted, not by Dixiecrats, but by the federal government for peaceful protest?\n\nBut what did the federal government do when Albany police deputies beat Attorney C.B. King and left him half-dead? What did the federal government do when local police officials kicked and assaulted the pregnant wife of Slater King, and she lost her baby? To those who have said, \"Be patient and wait,\" we must say that we cannot be patient. We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now!\n\n[Applause] [Music] [Applause] \n\nWe are tired! We are tired of being beaten by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jails over and over again. And then you holler, \"Be patient.\" How long can we be patient? We want our freedom and we want it now!\n\n[Applause] \n\nWe do not want to go to jail, but we will go to jail if this is the price we must pay for love, brotherhood, and true peace. I appeal to all of you to get in this great revolution that is sweeping this nation. Get in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation until true freedom comes, until the revolution of 1776 is complete.\n\nWe must get in this revolution and complete the revolution. For in the Delta of Mississippi, in southwest Georgia, in the Black Belt of Alabama, in Harlem, in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and all over this nation, the black masses are on the march for jobs and freedom.\n\nThey're talking about slow down and stop. We will not stop! All of the forces of Eastland, Barnett, Wallace, and Thurmond will not stop this revolution!\n\n[Applause] \n\nIf we do not get meaningful legislation out of this Congress, the time will come when we will not confine our marching to Washington. We will march through the South, through the streets of Jackson, through the streets of Danville, through the streets of Cambridge, through the streets of Birmingham. But we will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of dignity that we have shown here today.\n\n[Music] [Applause] \n\nBy the forces of our demands, our determination, and our numbers, we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy. We must say: Wake up America! Wake up! For we cannot stop, and we will not and cannot be patient!\n\n[Applause]",

Features the iconic closing line from John Gillespie Magee Jr.'s poem \"High Flight.\"\n\n---\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the State of the Union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans.\n\nToday is a day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss.\n\nNineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground. But we've never lost an astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle. But they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly.\n\nWe mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn their loss as a nation together.\n\nFor the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, \"Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy.\" They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve, and they did. They served all of us.\n\nWe've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for twenty-five years, the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.\n\nAnd I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them.\n\nI've always had great faith in and respect for our space program, and what happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our space program. We don't keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in public. That's the way freedom is, and we wouldn't change it for a minute.\n\nWe'll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.\n\nI want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA or who worked on this mission and tell them: \"Your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your anguish. We share it.\"\n\nThere's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, \"He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it.\" Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake's, complete.\n\nThe crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and \"slipped the surly bonds of earth\" to \"touch the face of God.\"\n\nThank you.",

Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Dick Durbin. You make us all proud. On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention.\n\nTonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance, my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.\n\nWhile studying here my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor, my grandfather signed up for duty. Joined the army, marched across Europe. Back home my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through F.H.A., and later moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity. And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter.\n\nA common dream born of two continents. My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, believing in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined -- they imagined me going to the best schools in the land even though they weren't rich because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential. They have both passed away now and yet I know that on this night they look down on me with great pride.\n\nThey stand here and I stand here today grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me and that in no other country on earth is my story even possible.\n\nTonight we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation. Not because of the height of our skyscrapers or the power of our military or the size of our economy, our pride is based on a very simple premise. Summed up in a declaration made over 200 years ago. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThat is the true genius of America. A faith in simple dreams. An insistence on small miracles. That we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. And we can say what we think, write what we think without hearing a sudden knock on the door, that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe, that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution and that our votes will be counted, at least most of the time.\n\nThis year in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forebears and the promise of future generations. Fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents, I say to you we have more work to do.\n\nMore work to do for the workers I met in Illinois who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico and now we're having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay $7 an hour, or the father I met that was losing his job and choking back the tears wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on. More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis and thousands more like her who has the grades, has the drive, has the will but doesn't have the money to go to college.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, the people I meet in small towns and big cities and diners and office parks, they don't expect government to solve all of their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to. Go into the counties around Chicago and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or by the Pentagon. Go into any inner city neighborhood and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn. They know the parents have to teach. The children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things.\n\nPeople don't expect government to solve all their problems but they sense deep in their bones that with just a slight change in priorities we could make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life. And that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better and they want that choice.\n\nIn this election we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer and that man is John Kerry. John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because they've defined his life from his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate. He has devoted himself to this country. Again and again we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home. John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves. John Kerry believes in energy independence so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties or use faith as a wedge to divide us. And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes but it should never be the first option.\n\nYou know, a while back -- a while back I met a young man in a V.F.W. hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, 6'2\", clear-eyed with an easy smile. He told me he joined the Marines and was headed to Iraq the following week. As I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service I thought this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child.\n\nBut then I asked myself, are we serving him as well as he's serving us? I thought of the 900 men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who won't be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families I met struggling to get by without a loved one's full income or whose loved one returned with a limb missing but still lack long-term health care benefits because they were reservists.\n\nWhen we send our young men and women into harm's way we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace and earn the respect of the world.\n\nNow let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued. And they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in America. And he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism there's another ingredient in the American saga. A belief that we're all connected as one people. If there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me even if it's not my child. If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription drugs and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer even if it's not my grandparent. If there's an Arab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process that threatens my civil liberties.\n\nIt is that fundamental belief -- it is that fundamental belief I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper that makes this country work. It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one American family. Out of many, one.\n\nNow even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight there is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America. There's the United States of America.\n\nThe pundits, the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states, red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats, but I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and, yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who oppose the war in Iraq and there are patriots who support the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.\n\nIn the end that's what this election is about. Do we participate in the politics of cynicism or in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here, the willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it or health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. That's not what I'm talking about.\n\nI'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs. The hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores. The hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta, the hope of a mill worker's son who dares to defy the odds, the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. Hope -- hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope.\n\nIn the end that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation, a belief in things not seen. A belief that there are better days ahead. I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with the road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs for the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that we have righteous wind at our backs and as we stand on the crossroads of history we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.\n\nAmerica, tonight if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine the people will rise up in November and John Kerry will be sworn in as president and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president and this country will reclaim its promise and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.",

This speech helped establish him as a key leader in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n---\n\n[Applause] We march today for jobs and freedom, but we have nothing to be proud of, for hundreds and thousands of our brothers are not here. They're receiving starvation wages or no wages at all. While we stand here, there are sharecroppers in the Delta of Mississippi who are out in the field working for less than three dollars a day, twelve hours a day. While we stand here, there are students in jail on trumped-up charges. Our brother James Farmer, along with many others, is also in jail.\n\nWe come here today with a great sense of misgiving. It is true that we support the administration's civil rights bill. We support it with great reservations, however. Unless Title Three is put in this bill, there's nothing to protect the young children and old women who must face police dogs and fire hoses in the South while they engage in peaceful demonstrations. In its present form, this bill will not protect the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear of a police state. It will not protect the hundreds and thousands of people who have been arrested upon trumped-up charges.\n\nWhat about the three young men - SNCC field secretaries in Americus, Georgia - who face the death penalty for engaging in peaceful protest? As it stands now, the voting section of this bill will not help the thousands of black people who want to vote. It will not help the citizens of Mississippi, of Alabama, and Georgia, who are qualified to vote but lack a sixth-grade education.\n\nWe must have legislation that will protect the Mississippi sharecropper who is put off of his farm because he dares to register to vote. We need a bill that will provide for the homeless and starving people of this nation. We need a bill to ensure the equality of a maid who earns five dollars a week in the home of a family whose total income is one hundred thousand dollars a year. We must have a good FEPC bill.\n\nMy friends, let us not forget that we are involved in a serious social revolution. By and large, American politics is dominated by politicians who build their careers on immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political, economic, and social exploitation. There are exceptions, of course - we salute those - but what political leader can stand up and say, \"My party is the party of principles\"? For the party of Kennedy is also the party of Eastland. The party of Javits is also the party of Goldwater.\n\nWhere is our party? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march on Washington? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march in the streets of Birmingham? Where is the political party that will protect the citizens of Albany, Georgia? Do you know that in Albany, Georgia, nine of our leaders have been indicted, not by Dixiecrats, but by the federal government for peaceful protest?\n\nBut what did the federal government do when Albany police deputies beat Attorney C.B. King and left him half-dead? What did the federal government do when local police officials kicked and assaulted the pregnant wife of Slater King, and she lost her baby? To those who have said, \"Be patient and wait,\" we must say that we cannot be patient. We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now!\n\n[Applause] [Music] [Applause] \n\nWe are tired! We are tired of being beaten by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jails over and over again. And then you holler, \"Be patient.\" How long can we be patient? We want our freedom and we want it now!\n\n[Applause] \n\nWe do not want to go to jail, but we will go to jail if this is the price we must pay for love, brotherhood, and true peace. I appeal to all of you to get in this great revolution that is sweeping this nation. Get in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation until true freedom comes, until the revolution of 1776 is complete.\n\nWe must get in this revolution and complete the revolution. For in the Delta of Mississippi, in southwest Georgia, in the Black Belt of Alabama, in Harlem, in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and all over this nation, the black masses are on the march for jobs and freedom.\n\nThey're talking about slow down and stop. We will not stop! All of the forces of Eastland, Barnett, Wallace, and Thurmond will not stop this revolution!\n\n[Applause] \n\nIf we do not get meaningful legislation out of this Congress, the time will come when we will not confine our marching to Washington. We will march through the South, through the streets of Jackson, through the streets of Danville, through the streets of Cambridge, through the streets of Birmingham. But we will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of dignity that we have shown here today.\n\n[Music] [Applause] \n\nBy the forces of our demands, our determination, and our numbers, we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy. We must say: Wake up America! Wake up! For we cannot stop, and we will not and cannot be patient!\n\n[Applause]",

Features the iconic closing line from John Gillespie Magee Jr.'s poem \"High Flight.\"\n\n---\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the State of the Union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans.\n\nToday is a day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss.\n\nNineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground. But we've never lost an astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle. But they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly.\n\nWe mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn their loss as a nation together.\n\nFor the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, \"Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy.\" They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve, and they did. They served all of us.\n\nWe've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for twenty-five years, the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.\n\nAnd I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them.\n\nI've always had great faith in and respect for our space program, and what happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our space program. We don't keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in public. That's the way freedom is, and we wouldn't change it for a minute.\n\nWe'll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.\n\nI want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA or who worked on this mission and tell them: \"Your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your anguish. We share it.\"\n\nThere's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, \"He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it.\" Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake's, complete.\n\nThe crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and \"slipped the surly bonds of earth\" to \"touch the face of God.\"\n\nThank you.",

Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Dick Durbin. You make us all proud. On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention.\n\nTonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance, my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.\n\nWhile studying here my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor, my grandfather signed up for duty. Joined the army, marched across Europe. Back home my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through F.H.A., and later moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity. And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter.\n\nA common dream born of two continents. My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, believing in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined -- they imagined me going to the best schools in the land even though they weren't rich because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential. They have both passed away now and yet I know that on this night they look down on me with great pride.\n\nThey stand here and I stand here today grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me and that in no other country on earth is my story even possible.\n\nTonight we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation. Not because of the height of our skyscrapers or the power of our military or the size of our economy, our pride is based on a very simple premise. Summed up in a declaration made over 200 years ago. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThat is the true genius of America. A faith in simple dreams. An insistence on small miracles. That we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. And we can say what we think, write what we think without hearing a sudden knock on the door, that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe, that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution and that our votes will be counted, at least most of the time.\n\nThis year in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forebears and the promise of future generations. Fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents, I say to you we have more work to do.\n\nMore work to do for the workers I met in Illinois who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico and now we're having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay $7 an hour, or the father I met that was losing his job and choking back the tears wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on. More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis and thousands more like her who has the grades, has the drive, has the will but doesn't have the money to go to college.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, the people I meet in small towns and big cities and diners and office parks, they don't expect government to solve all of their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to. Go into the counties around Chicago and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or by the Pentagon. Go into any inner city neighborhood and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn. They know the parents have to teach. The children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things.\n\nPeople don't expect government to solve all their problems but they sense deep in their bones that with just a slight change in priorities we could make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life. And that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better and they want that choice.\n\nIn this election we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer and that man is John Kerry. John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because they've defined his life from his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate. He has devoted himself to this country. Again and again we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home. John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves. John Kerry believes in energy independence so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties or use faith as a wedge to divide us. And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes but it should never be the first option.\n\nYou know, a while back -- a while back I met a young man in a V.F.W. hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, 6'2\", clear-eyed with an easy smile. He told me he joined the Marines and was headed to Iraq the following week. As I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service I thought this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child.\n\nBut then I asked myself, are we serving him as well as he's serving us? I thought of the 900 men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who won't be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families I met struggling to get by without a loved one's full income or whose loved one returned with a limb missing but still lack long-term health care benefits because they were reservists.\n\nWhen we send our young men and women into harm's way we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace and earn the respect of the world.\n\nNow let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued. And they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in America. And he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism there's another ingredient in the American saga. A belief that we're all connected as one people. If there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me even if it's not my child. If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription drugs and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer even if it's not my grandparent. If there's an Arab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process that threatens my civil liberties.\n\nIt is that fundamental belief -- it is that fundamental belief I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper that makes this country work. It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one American family. Out of many, one.\n\nNow even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight there is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America. There's the United States of America.\n\nThe pundits, the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states, red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats, but I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and, yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who oppose the war in Iraq and there are patriots who support the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.\n\nIn the end that's what this election is about. Do we participate in the politics of cynicism or in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here, the willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it or health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. That's not what I'm talking about.\n\nI'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs. The hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores. The hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta, the hope of a mill worker's son who dares to defy the odds, the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. Hope -- hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope.\n\nIn the end that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation, a belief in things not seen. A belief that there are better days ahead. I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with the road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs for the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that we have righteous wind at our backs and as we stand on the crossroads of history we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.\n\nAmerica, tonight if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine the people will rise up in November and John Kerry will be sworn in as president and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president and this country will reclaim its promise and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.",

This speech helped establish him as a key leader in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n---\n\n[Applause] We march today for jobs and freedom, but we have nothing to be proud of, for hundreds and thousands of our brothers are not here. They're receiving starvation wages or no wages at all. While we stand here, there are sharecroppers in the Delta of Mississippi who are out in the field working for less than three dollars a day, twelve hours a day. While we stand here, there are students in jail on trumped-up charges. Our brother James Farmer, along with many others, is also in jail.\n\nWe come here today with a great sense of misgiving. It is true that we support the administration's civil rights bill. We support it with great reservations, however. Unless Title Three is put in this bill, there's nothing to protect the young children and old women who must face police dogs and fire hoses in the South while they engage in peaceful demonstrations. In its present form, this bill will not protect the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear of a police state. It will not protect the hundreds and thousands of people who have been arrested upon trumped-up charges.\n\nWhat about the three young men - SNCC field secretaries in Americus, Georgia - who face the death penalty for engaging in peaceful protest? As it stands now, the voting section of this bill will not help the thousands of black people who want to vote. It will not help the citizens of Mississippi, of Alabama, and Georgia, who are qualified to vote but lack a sixth-grade education.\n\nWe must have legislation that will protect the Mississippi sharecropper who is put off of his farm because he dares to register to vote. We need a bill that will provide for the homeless and starving people of this nation. We need a bill to ensure the equality of a maid who earns five dollars a week in the home of a family whose total income is one hundred thousand dollars a year. We must have a good FEPC bill.\n\nMy friends, let us not forget that we are involved in a serious social revolution. By and large, American politics is dominated by politicians who build their careers on immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political, economic, and social exploitation. There are exceptions, of course - we salute those - but what political leader can stand up and say, \"My party is the party of principles\"? For the party of Kennedy is also the party of Eastland. The party of Javits is also the party of Goldwater.\n\nWhere is our party? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march on Washington? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march in the streets of Birmingham? Where is the political party that will protect the citizens of Albany, Georgia? Do you know that in Albany, Georgia, nine of our leaders have been indicted, not by Dixiecrats, but by the federal government for peaceful protest?\n\nBut what did the federal government do when Albany police deputies beat Attorney C.B. King and left him half-dead? What did the federal government do when local police officials kicked and assaulted the pregnant wife of Slater King, and she lost her baby? To those who have said, \"Be patient and wait,\" we must say that we cannot be patient. We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now!\n\n[Applause] [Music] [Applause] \n\nWe are tired! We are tired of being beaten by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jails over and over again. And then you holler, \"Be patient.\" How long can we be patient? We want our freedom and we want it now!\n\n[Applause] \n\nWe do not want to go to jail, but we will go to jail if this is the price we must pay for love, brotherhood, and true peace. I appeal to all of you to get in this great revolution that is sweeping this nation. Get in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation until true freedom comes, until the revolution of 1776 is complete.\n\nWe must get in this revolution and complete the revolution. For in the Delta of Mississippi, in southwest Georgia, in the Black Belt of Alabama, in Harlem, in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and all over this nation, the black masses are on the march for jobs and freedom.\n\nThey're talking about slow down and stop. We will not stop! All of the forces of Eastland, Barnett, Wallace, and Thurmond will not stop this revolution!\n\n[Applause] \n\nIf we do not get meaningful legislation out of this Congress, the time will come when we will not confine our marching to Washington. We will march through the South, through the streets of Jackson, through the streets of Danville, through the streets of Cambridge, through the streets of Birmingham. But we will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of dignity that we have shown here today.\n\n[Music] [Applause] \n\nBy the forces of our demands, our determination, and our numbers, we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy. We must say: Wake up America! Wake up! For we cannot stop, and we will not and cannot be patient!\n\n[Applause]",

Features the iconic closing line from John Gillespie Magee Jr.'s poem \"High Flight.\"\n\n---\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the State of the Union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans.\n\nToday is a day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss.\n\nNineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground. But we've never lost an astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle. But they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly.\n\nWe mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn their loss as a nation together.\n\nFor the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, \"Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy.\" They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve, and they did. They served all of us.\n\nWe've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for twenty-five years, the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.\n\nAnd I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them.\n\nI've always had great faith in and respect for our space program, and what happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our space program. We don't keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in public. That's the way freedom is, and we wouldn't change it for a minute.\n\nWe'll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.\n\nI want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA or who worked on this mission and tell them: \"Your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your anguish. We share it.\"\n\nThere's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, \"He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it.\" Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake's, complete.\n\nThe crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and \"slipped the surly bonds of earth\" to \"touch the face of God.\"\n\nThank you.",

Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Dick Durbin. You make us all proud. On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention.\n\nTonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance, my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.\n\nWhile studying here my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor, my grandfather signed up for duty. Joined the army, marched across Europe. Back home my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through F.H.A., and later moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity. And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter.\n\nA common dream born of two continents. My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, believing in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined -- they imagined me going to the best schools in the land even though they weren't rich because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential. They have both passed away now and yet I know that on this night they look down on me with great pride.\n\nThey stand here and I stand here today grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me and that in no other country on earth is my story even possible.\n\nTonight we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation. Not because of the height of our skyscrapers or the power of our military or the size of our economy, our pride is based on a very simple premise. Summed up in a declaration made over 200 years ago. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThat is the true genius of America. A faith in simple dreams. An insistence on small miracles. That we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. And we can say what we think, write what we think without hearing a sudden knock on the door, that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe, that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution and that our votes will be counted, at least most of the time.\n\nThis year in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forebears and the promise of future generations. Fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents, I say to you we have more work to do.\n\nMore work to do for the workers I met in Illinois who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico and now we're having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay $7 an hour, or the father I met that was losing his job and choking back the tears wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on. More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis and thousands more like her who has the grades, has the drive, has the will but doesn't have the money to go to college.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, the people I meet in small towns and big cities and diners and office parks, they don't expect government to solve all of their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to. Go into the counties around Chicago and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or by the Pentagon. Go into any inner city neighborhood and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn. They know the parents have to teach. The children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things.\n\nPeople don't expect government to solve all their problems but they sense deep in their bones that with just a slight change in priorities we could make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life. And that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better and they want that choice.\n\nIn this election we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer and that man is John Kerry. John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because they've defined his life from his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate. He has devoted himself to this country. Again and again we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home. John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves. John Kerry believes in energy independence so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties or use faith as a wedge to divide us. And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes but it should never be the first option.\n\nYou know, a while back -- a while back I met a young man in a V.F.W. hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, 6'2\", clear-eyed with an easy smile. He told me he joined the Marines and was headed to Iraq the following week. As I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service I thought this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child.\n\nBut then I asked myself, are we serving him as well as he's serving us? I thought of the 900 men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who won't be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families I met struggling to get by without a loved one's full income or whose loved one returned with a limb missing but still lack long-term health care benefits because they were reservists.\n\nWhen we send our young men and women into harm's way we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace and earn the respect of the world.\n\nNow let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued. And they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in America. And he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism there's another ingredient in the American saga. A belief that we're all connected as one people. If there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me even if it's not my child. If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription drugs and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer even if it's not my grandparent. If there's an Arab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process that threatens my civil liberties.\n\nIt is that fundamental belief -- it is that fundamental belief I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper that makes this country work. It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one American family. Out of many, one.\n\nNow even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight there is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America. There's the United States of America.\n\nThe pundits, the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states, red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats, but I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and, yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who oppose the war in Iraq and there are patriots who support the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.\n\nIn the end that's what this election is about. Do we participate in the politics of cynicism or in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here, the willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it or health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. That's not what I'm talking about.\n\nI'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs. The hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores. The hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta, the hope of a mill worker's son who dares to defy the odds, the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. Hope -- hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope.\n\nIn the end that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation, a belief in things not seen. A belief that there are better days ahead. I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with the road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs for the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that we have righteous wind at our backs and as we stand on the crossroads of history we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.\n\nAmerica, tonight if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine the people will rise up in November and John Kerry will be sworn in as president and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president and this country will reclaim its promise and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.",

This speech helped establish him as a key leader in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n---\n\n[Applause] We march today for jobs and freedom, but we have nothing to be proud of, for hundreds and thousands of our brothers are not here. They're receiving starvation wages or no wages at all. While we stand here, there are sharecroppers in the Delta of Mississippi who are out in the field working for less than three dollars a day, twelve hours a day. While we stand here, there are students in jail on trumped-up charges. Our brother James Farmer, along with many others, is also in jail.\n\nWe come here today with a great sense of misgiving. It is true that we support the administration's civil rights bill. We support it with great reservations, however. Unless Title Three is put in this bill, there's nothing to protect the young children and old women who must face police dogs and fire hoses in the South while they engage in peaceful demonstrations. In its present form, this bill will not protect the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear of a police state. It will not protect the hundreds and thousands of people who have been arrested upon trumped-up charges.\n\nWhat about the three young men - SNCC field secretaries in Americus, Georgia - who face the death penalty for engaging in peaceful protest? As it stands now, the voting section of this bill will not help the thousands of black people who want to vote. It will not help the citizens of Mississippi, of Alabama, and Georgia, who are qualified to vote but lack a sixth-grade education.\n\nWe must have legislation that will protect the Mississippi sharecropper who is put off of his farm because he dares to register to vote. We need a bill that will provide for the homeless and starving people of this nation. We need a bill to ensure the equality of a maid who earns five dollars a week in the home of a family whose total income is one hundred thousand dollars a year. We must have a good FEPC bill.\n\nMy friends, let us not forget that we are involved in a serious social revolution. By and large, American politics is dominated by politicians who build their careers on immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political, economic, and social exploitation. There are exceptions, of course - we salute those - but what political leader can stand up and say, \"My party is the party of principles\"? For the party of Kennedy is also the party of Eastland. The party of Javits is also the party of Goldwater.\n\nWhere is our party? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march on Washington? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march in the streets of Birmingham? Where is the political party that will protect the citizens of Albany, Georgia? Do you know that in Albany, Georgia, nine of our leaders have been indicted, not by Dixiecrats, but by the federal government for peaceful protest?\n\nBut what did the federal government do when Albany police deputies beat Attorney C.B. King and left him half-dead? What did the federal government do when local police officials kicked and assaulted the pregnant wife of Slater King, and she lost her baby? To those who have said, \"Be patient and wait,\" we must say that we cannot be patient. We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now!\n\n[Applause] [Music] [Applause] \n\nWe are tired! We are tired of being beaten by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jails over and over again. And then you holler, \"Be patient.\" How long can we be patient? We want our freedom and we want it now!\n\n[Applause] \n\nWe do not want to go to jail, but we will go to jail if this is the price we must pay for love, brotherhood, and true peace. I appeal to all of you to get in this great revolution that is sweeping this nation. Get in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation until true freedom comes, until the revolution of 1776 is complete.\n\nWe must get in this revolution and complete the revolution. For in the Delta of Mississippi, in southwest Georgia, in the Black Belt of Alabama, in Harlem, in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and all over this nation, the black masses are on the march for jobs and freedom.\n\nThey're talking about slow down and stop. We will not stop! All of the forces of Eastland, Barnett, Wallace, and Thurmond will not stop this revolution!\n\n[Applause] \n\nIf we do not get meaningful legislation out of this Congress, the time will come when we will not confine our marching to Washington. We will march through the South, through the streets of Jackson, through the streets of Danville, through the streets of Cambridge, through the streets of Birmingham. But we will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of dignity that we have shown here today.\n\n[Music] [Applause] \n\nBy the forces of our demands, our determination, and our numbers, we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy. We must say: Wake up America! Wake up! For we cannot stop, and we will not and cannot be patient!\n\n[Applause]",

This is truly a national loss.\n\nNineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground. But we've never lost an astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle. But they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly.\n\nWe mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn their loss as a nation together.\n\nFor the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, \"Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy.\" They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve, and they did. They served all of us.\n\nWe've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for twenty-five years, the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.\n\nAnd I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them.\n\nI've always had great faith in and respect for our space program, and what happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our space program. We don't keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in public. That's the way freedom is, and we wouldn't change it for a minute.\n\nWe'll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.\n\nI want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA or who worked on this mission and tell them: \"Your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your anguish. We share it.\"\n\nThere's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, \"He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it.\" Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake's, complete.\n\nThe crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and \"slipped the surly bonds of earth\" to \"touch the face of God.\"\n\nThank you.",

Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Dick Durbin. You make us all proud. On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention.\n\nTonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance, my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.\n\nWhile studying here my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor, my grandfather signed up for duty. Joined the army, marched across Europe. Back home my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through F.H.A., and later moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity. And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter.\n\nA common dream born of two continents. My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, believing in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined -- they imagined me going to the best schools in the land even though they weren't rich because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential. They have both passed away now and yet I know that on this night they look down on me with great pride.\n\nThey stand here and I stand here today grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me and that in no other country on earth is my story even possible.\n\nTonight we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation. Not because of the height of our skyscrapers or the power of our military or the size of our economy, our pride is based on a very simple premise. Summed up in a declaration made over 200 years ago. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThat is the true genius of America. A faith in simple dreams. An insistence on small miracles. That we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. And we can say what we think, write what we think without hearing a sudden knock on the door, that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe, that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution and that our votes will be counted, at least most of the time.\n\nThis year in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forebears and the promise of future generations. Fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents, I say to you we have more work to do.\n\nMore work to do for the workers I met in Illinois who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico and now we're having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay $7 an hour, or the father I met that was losing his job and choking back the tears wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on. More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis and thousands more like her who has the grades, has the drive, has the will but doesn't have the money to go to college.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, the people I meet in small towns and big cities and diners and office parks, they don't expect government to solve all of their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to. Go into the counties around Chicago and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or by the Pentagon. Go into any inner city neighborhood and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn. They know the parents have to teach. The children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things.\n\nPeople don't expect government to solve all their problems but they sense deep in their bones that with just a slight change in priorities we could make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life. And that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better and they want that choice.\n\nIn this election we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer and that man is John Kerry. John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because they've defined his life from his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate. He has devoted himself to this country. Again and again we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home. John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves. John Kerry believes in energy independence so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties or use faith as a wedge to divide us. And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes but it should never be the first option.\n\nYou know, a while back -- a while back I met a young man in a V.F.W. hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, 6'2\", clear-eyed with an easy smile. He told me he joined the Marines and was headed to Iraq the following week. As I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service I thought this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child.\n\nBut then I asked myself, are we serving him as well as he's serving us? I thought of the 900 men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who won't be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families I met struggling to get by without a loved one's full income or whose loved one returned with a limb missing but still lack long-term health care benefits because they were reservists.\n\nWhen we send our young men and women into harm's way we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace and earn the respect of the world.\n\nNow let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued. And they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in America. And he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism there's another ingredient in the American saga. A belief that we're all connected as one people. If there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me even if it's not my child. If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription drugs and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer even if it's not my grandparent. If there's an Arab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process that threatens my civil liberties.\n\nIt is that fundamental belief -- it is that fundamental belief I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper that makes this country work. It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one American family. Out of many, one.\n\nNow even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight there is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America. There's the United States of America.\n\nThe pundits, the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states, red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats, but I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and, yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who oppose the war in Iraq and there are patriots who support the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.\n\nIn the end that's what this election is about. Do we participate in the politics of cynicism or in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here, the willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it or health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. That's not what I'm talking about.\n\nI'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs. The hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores. The hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta, the hope of a mill worker's son who dares to defy the odds, the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. Hope -- hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope.\n\nIn the end that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation, a belief in things not seen. A belief that there are better days ahead. I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with the road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs for the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that we have righteous wind at our backs and as we stand on the crossroads of history we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.\n\nAmerica, tonight if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine the people will rise up in November and John Kerry will be sworn in as president and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president and this country will reclaim its promise and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.",

This speech helped establish him as a key leader in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n---\n\n[Applause] We march today for jobs and freedom, but we have nothing to be proud of, for hundreds and thousands of our brothers are not here. They're receiving starvation wages or no wages at all. While we stand here, there are sharecroppers in the Delta of Mississippi who are out in the field working for less than three dollars a day, twelve hours a day. While we stand here, there are students in jail on trumped-up charges. Our brother James Farmer, along with many others, is also in jail.\n\nWe come here today with a great sense of misgiving. It is true that we support the administration's civil rights bill. We support it with great reservations, however. Unless Title Three is put in this bill, there's nothing to protect the young children and old women who must face police dogs and fire hoses in the South while they engage in peaceful demonstrations. In its present form, this bill will not protect the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear of a police state. It will not protect the hundreds and thousands of people who have been arrested upon trumped-up charges.\n\nWhat about the three young men - SNCC field secretaries in Americus, Georgia - who face the death penalty for engaging in peaceful protest? As it stands now, the voting section of this bill will not help the thousands of black people who want to vote. It will not help the citizens of Mississippi, of Alabama, and Georgia, who are qualified to vote but lack a sixth-grade education.\n\nWe must have legislation that will protect the Mississippi sharecropper who is put off of his farm because he dares to register to vote. We need a bill that will provide for the homeless and starving people of this nation. We need a bill to ensure the equality of a maid who earns five dollars a week in the home of a family whose total income is one hundred thousand dollars a year. We must have a good FEPC bill.\n\nMy friends, let us not forget that we are involved in a serious social revolution. By and large, American politics is dominated by politicians who build their careers on immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political, economic, and social exploitation. There are exceptions, of course - we salute those - but what political leader can stand up and say, \"My party is the party of principles\"? For the party of Kennedy is also the party of Eastland. The party of Javits is also the party of Goldwater.\n\nWhere is our party? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march on Washington? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march in the streets of Birmingham? Where is the political party that will protect the citizens of Albany, Georgia? Do you know that in Albany, Georgia, nine of our leaders have been indicted, not by Dixiecrats, but by the federal government for peaceful protest?\n\nBut what did the federal government do when Albany police deputies beat Attorney C.B. King and left him half-dead? What did the federal government do when local police officials kicked and assaulted the pregnant wife of Slater King, and she lost her baby? To those who have said, \"Be patient and wait,\" we must say that we cannot be patient. We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now!\n\n[Applause] [Music] [Applause] \n\nWe are tired! We are tired of being beaten by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jails over and over again. And then you holler, \"Be patient.\" How long can we be patient? We want our freedom and we want it now!\n\n[Applause] \n\nWe do not want to go to jail, but we will go to jail if this is the price we must pay for love, brotherhood, and true peace. I appeal to all of you to get in this great revolution that is sweeping this nation. Get in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation until true freedom comes, until the revolution of 1776 is complete.\n\nWe must get in this revolution and complete the revolution. For in the Delta of Mississippi, in southwest Georgia, in the Black Belt of Alabama, in Harlem, in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and all over this nation, the black masses are on the march for jobs and freedom.\n\nThey're talking about slow down and stop. We will not stop! All of the forces of Eastland, Barnett, Wallace, and Thurmond will not stop this revolution!\n\n[Applause] \n\nIf we do not get meaningful legislation out of this Congress, the time will come when we will not confine our marching to Washington. We will march through the South, through the streets of Jackson, through the streets of Danville, through the streets of Cambridge, through the streets of Birmingham. But we will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of dignity that we have shown here today.\n\n[Music] [Applause] \n\nBy the forces of our demands, our determination, and our numbers, we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy. We must say: Wake up America! Wake up! For we cannot stop, and we will not and cannot be patient!\n\n[Applause]",

Features the iconic closing line from John Gillespie Magee Jr.'s poem \"High Flight.\"\n\n---\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the State of the Union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans.\n\nToday is a day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss.\n\nNineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground. But we've never lost an astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle. But they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly.\n\nWe mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn their loss as a nation together.\n\nFor the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, \"Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy.\" They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve, and they did. They served all of us.\n\nWe've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for twenty-five years, the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.\n\nAnd I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them.\n\nI've always had great faith in and respect for our space program, and what happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our space program. We don't keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in public. That's the way freedom is, and we wouldn't change it for a minute.\n\nWe'll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.\n\nI want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA or who worked on this mission and tell them: \"Your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your anguish. We share it.\"\n\nThere's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, \"He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it.\" Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake's, complete.\n\nThe crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and \"slipped the surly bonds of earth\" to \"touch the face of God.\"\n\nThank you.",

Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Dick Durbin. You make us all proud. On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention.\n\nTonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance, my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.\n\nWhile studying here my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor, my grandfather signed up for duty. Joined the army, marched across Europe. Back home my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through F.H.A., and later moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity. And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter.\n\nA common dream born of two continents. My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, believing in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined -- they imagined me going to the best schools in the land even though they weren't rich because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential. They have both passed away now and yet I know that on this night they look down on me with great pride.\n\nThey stand here and I stand here today grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me and that in no other country on earth is my story even possible.\n\nTonight we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation. Not because of the height of our skyscrapers or the power of our military or the size of our economy, our pride is based on a very simple premise. Summed up in a declaration made over 200 years ago. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThat is the true genius of America. A faith in simple dreams. An insistence on small miracles. That we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. And we can say what we think, write what we think without hearing a sudden knock on the door, that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe, that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution and that our votes will be counted, at least most of the time.\n\nThis year in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forebears and the promise of future generations. Fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents, I say to you we have more work to do.\n\nMore work to do for the workers I met in Illinois who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico and now we're having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay $7 an hour, or the father I met that was losing his job and choking back the tears wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on. More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis and thousands more like her who has the grades, has the drive, has the will but doesn't have the money to go to college.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, the people I meet in small towns and big cities and diners and office parks, they don't expect government to solve all of their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to. Go into the counties around Chicago and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or by the Pentagon. Go into any inner city neighborhood and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn. They know the parents have to teach. The children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things.\n\nPeople don't expect government to solve all their problems but they sense deep in their bones that with just a slight change in priorities we could make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life. And that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better and they want that choice.\n\nIn this election we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer and that man is John Kerry. John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because they've defined his life from his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate. He has devoted himself to this country. Again and again we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home. John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves. John Kerry believes in energy independence so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties or use faith as a wedge to divide us. And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes but it should never be the first option.\n\nYou know, a while back -- a while back I met a young man in a V.F.W. hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, 6'2\", clear-eyed with an easy smile. He told me he joined the Marines and was headed to Iraq the following week. As I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service I thought this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child.\n\nBut then I asked myself, are we serving him as well as he's serving us? I thought of the 900 men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who won't be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families I met struggling to get by without a loved one's full income or whose loved one returned with a limb missing but still lack long-term health care benefits because they were reservists.\n\nWhen we send our young men and women into harm's way we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace and earn the respect of the world.\n\nNow let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued. And they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in America. And he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism there's another ingredient in the American saga. A belief that we're all connected as one people. If there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me even if it's not my child. If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription drugs and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer even if it's not my grandparent. If there's an Arab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process that threatens my civil liberties.\n\nIt is that fundamental belief -- it is that fundamental belief I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper that makes this country work. It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one American family. Out of many, one.\n\nNow even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight there is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America. There's the United States of America.\n\nThe pundits, the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states, red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats, but I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and, yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who oppose the war in Iraq and there are patriots who support the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.\n\nIn the end that's what this election is about. Do we participate in the politics of cynicism or in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here, the willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it or health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. That's not what I'm talking about.\n\nI'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs. The hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores. The hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta, the hope of a mill worker's son who dares to defy the odds, the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. Hope -- hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope.\n\nIn the end that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation, a belief in things not seen. A belief that there are better days ahead. I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with the road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs for the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that we have righteous wind at our backs and as we stand on the crossroads of history we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.\n\nAmerica, tonight if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine the people will rise up in November and John Kerry will be sworn in as president and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president and this country will reclaim its promise and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.",

This speech helped establish him as a key leader in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n---\n\n[Applause] We march today for jobs and freedom, but we have nothing to be proud of, for hundreds and thousands of our brothers are not here. They're receiving starvation wages or no wages at all. While we stand here, there are sharecroppers in the Delta of Mississippi who are out in the field working for less than three dollars a day, twelve hours a day. While we stand here, there are students in jail on trumped-up charges. Our brother James Farmer, along with many others, is also in jail.\n\nWe come here today with a great sense of misgiving. It is true that we support the administration's civil rights bill. We support it with great reservations, however. Unless Title Three is put in this bill, there's nothing to protect the young children and old women who must face police dogs and fire hoses in the South while they engage in peaceful demonstrations. In its present form, this bill will not protect the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear of a police state. It will not protect the hundreds and thousands of people who have been arrested upon trumped-up charges.\n\nWhat about the three young men - SNCC field secretaries in Americus, Georgia - who face the death penalty for engaging in peaceful protest? As it stands now, the voting section of this bill will not help the thousands of black people who want to vote. It will not help the citizens of Mississippi, of Alabama, and Georgia, who are qualified to vote but lack a sixth-grade education.\n\nWe must have legislation that will protect the Mississippi sharecropper who is put off of his farm because he dares to register to vote. We need a bill that will provide for the homeless and starving people of this nation. We need a bill to ensure the equality of a maid who earns five dollars a week in the home of a family whose total income is one hundred thousand dollars a year. We must have a good FEPC bill.\n\nMy friends, let us not forget that we are involved in a serious social revolution. By and large, American politics is dominated by politicians who build their careers on immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political, economic, and social exploitation. There are exceptions, of course - we salute those - but what political leader can stand up and say, \"My party is the party of principles\"? For the party of Kennedy is also the party of Eastland. The party of Javits is also the party of Goldwater.\n\nWhere is our party? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march on Washington? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march in the streets of Birmingham? Where is the political party that will protect the citizens of Albany, Georgia? Do you know that in Albany, Georgia, nine of our leaders have been indicted, not by Dixiecrats, but by the federal government for peaceful protest?\n\nBut what did the federal government do when Albany police deputies beat Attorney C.B. King and left him half-dead? What did the federal government do when local police officials kicked and assaulted the pregnant wife of Slater King, and she lost her baby? To those who have said, \"Be patient and wait,\" we must say that we cannot be patient. We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now!\n\n[Applause] [Music] [Applause] \n\nWe are tired! We are tired of being beaten by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jails over and over again. And then you holler, \"Be patient.\" How long can we be patient? We want our freedom and we want it now!\n\n[Applause] \n\nWe do not want to go to jail, but we will go to jail if this is the price we must pay for love, brotherhood, and true peace. I appeal to all of you to get in this great revolution that is sweeping this nation. Get in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation until true freedom comes, until the revolution of 1776 is complete.\n\nWe must get in this revolution and complete the revolution. For in the Delta of Mississippi, in southwest Georgia, in the Black Belt of Alabama, in Harlem, in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and all over this nation, the black masses are on the march for jobs and freedom.\n\nThey're talking about slow down and stop. We will not stop! All of the forces of Eastland, Barnett, Wallace, and Thurmond will not stop this revolution!\n\n[Applause] \n\nIf we do not get meaningful legislation out of this Congress, the time will come when we will not confine our marching to Washington. We will march through the South, through the streets of Jackson, through the streets of Danville, through the streets of Cambridge, through the streets of Birmingham. But we will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of dignity that we have shown here today.\n\n[Music] [Applause] \n\nBy the forces of our demands, our determination, and our numbers, we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy. We must say: Wake up America! Wake up! For we cannot stop, and we will not and cannot be patient!\n\n[Applause]",
