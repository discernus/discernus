## Overview
This framework assesses civic character through virtue and vice dimensions in political discourse, providing a systematic approach to evaluating the character traits exhibited in public communication.

## Analytical Dimensions

### Virtues (Positive Character Traits)
- **Integrity**: Consistency between stated values and actions, honesty in communication
- **Courage**: Willingness to take principled stands despite opposition or political cost  
- **Compassion**: Demonstrated concern for others' wellbeing, empathy in policy positions
- **Justice**: Commitment to fairness, equal treatment, and procedural fairness
- **Wisdom**: Sound judgment, long-term thinking, evidence-based decision making

### Vices (Negative Character Traits)  
- **Corruption**: Self-serving behavior at public expense, conflicts of interest
- **Cowardice**: Avoiding difficult decisions, failure to take principled stands
- **Cruelty**: Callousness toward others' suffering, harmful policy positions
- **Injustice**: Unfair treatment, discrimination, procedural violations
- **Folly**: Poor judgment, short-sighted thinking, ignoring evidence

## Research Hypotheses

### H1: Virtue Cluster Coherence
Virtue dimensions will demonstrate positive inter-correlations, forming a coherent psychological construct.

### H2: Vice Cluster Coherence
Vice dimensions will demonstrate positive inter-correlations, forming a coherent psychological construct.

### H3: Virtue-Vice Opposition  
Virtue and vice dimensions will demonstrate negative correlations, indicating they represent opposing character traits.

### H4: Overall Civic Character
The overall virtue score will significantly exceed the overall vice score, indicating net positive civic character in democratic discourse.

## Statistical Requirements

### Reliability Assessment
- Calculate Cronbach's alpha for virtue cluster (threshold: Œ± ‚â• 0.70)
- Calculate Cronbach's alpha for vice cluster (threshold: Œ± ‚â• 0.70)
- Report reliability implications for construct validity

### Correlation Analysis
- Generate correlation matrices for virtue and vice clusters separately
- Generate comprehensive correlation matrix including all dimensions
- Calculate overall virtue vs. overall vice correlation

### Hypothesis Testing
- Test H1-H4 using appropriate statistical methods
- Report p-values, confidence intervals, and effect sizes
- Use Œ± = 0.05 significance level with Bonferroni correction where applicable

### Effect Size Analysis
- Calculate Cohen's d for significant mean differences
- Calculate Œ∑¬≤ (eta-squared) for ANOVA effects where applicable
- Interpret practical significance alongside statistical significance

## Expected Theoretical Outcomes
1. Strong internal consistency within virtue and vice clusters
2. Moderate to strong negative correlations between virtue and vice dimensions  
3. Overall virtue scores exceeding vice scores in democratic political discourse
4. Meaningful individual differences enabling character assessment
