The fight for a sustainable future is, at its core, a fight for human dignity. Every person on this planet has a fundamental right to clean air, clean water, and a healthy environment. This principle transcends borders and politics. It is a universal charge to protect our shared home for our children and grandchildren, ensuring that they too have the opportunity to lead lives of health and prosperity. To achieve this, we must foster a global community where innovation, collaboration, and individual responsibility are celebrated. We must empower scientists, engineers, and citizens to develop the solutions that will power our world without poisoning it, and we must ensure that the benefits of this green transition are accessible to all, not just a privileged few.

Yet, we must be undeceived about the nature of this challenge. Our collective progress is being actively sabotaged by a cabal of fossil fuel executives and their paid-for politicians who have prioritized their short-term profits over the long-term health of our planet and its people. For decades, they have known the truth and have spent billions to spread lies and confusion. This is not an honest disagreement among well-meaning parties. This is a moral battle between the people who cherish our planet and a greedy, reckless industry that sees it as nothing more than a resource to be plundered.

Our movement, the climate justice movement, is the immune system of the planet. We are the ones who must stand up and say, "no more." We are a tribe of protectors, of activists, of concerned citizens from every walk of life, bound together by our commitment to a livable future. They will call us radical, but there is nothing more radical than sacrificing the future of humanity for another quarter of record profits. We must be unapologetic in our demands for a rapid transition to renewable energy. We must hold these corporate polluters and their political allies accountable for the damage they have caused.

While our goal is a world that honors the dignity of every person, we can only achieve it by recognizing that we are in a fight. It is us—the protectors of the Earth—against them, the architects of its destruction. We must build our coalition, strengthen our bonds of solidarity, and relentlessly pursue our agenda. The future of our world depends on our ability to embrace the universal dignity of all people while simultaneously waging a tribal struggle against the powerful forces of greed and destruction that threaten us all. There is no middle ground when the fate of our planet is at stake.
