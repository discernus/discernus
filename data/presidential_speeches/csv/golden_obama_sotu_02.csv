obama_sotu_02_002,Obama,SOTU,02,2,"For 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty. They've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility, and they've done so in the midst of war and depression, at moments of great strife and great struggle. It's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable, that America was always destined to succeed.",0,59,351,3,17.7

obama_sotu_02_006,Obama,SOTU,02,6,"Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression. So we acted, immediately and aggressively. And 1 year later, the worst of the storm has passed.",0,36,204,3,10.8

obama_sotu_02_009,Obama,SOTU,02,9,"This recession has also compounded the burdens that America's families have been dealing with for decades: the burden of working harder and longer for less, of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college. So I know the anxieties that are out there right now. They're not new.",0,52,295,3,15.6
obama_sotu_02_010,Obama,SOTU,02,10,"These struggles are the reason I ran for President. These struggles are what I've witnessed for years, in places like Elkhart, Indiana; Galesburg, Illinois. I hear about them in the letters that I read each night.",0,36,213,3,10.8

obama_sotu_02_012,Obama,SOTU,02,12,"For these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough. Some are frustrated, some are angry.

obama_sotu_02_015,Obama,SOTU,02,15,"For while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same. The aspirations they hold are shared: a job that pays the bills, a chance to get ahead, most of all, the ability to give their children a better life. And you know what else they share?",0,58,327,3,17.4

And tonight I'd like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise.",0,46,258,3,13.8
obama_sotu_02_020,Obama,SOTU,02,20,It begins with our economy. Our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis. It was not easy to do.,0,30,152,3,9.0
obama_sotu_02_021,Obama,SOTU,02,21,"And if there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank bailout. I hated it. I hated it; you hated it.",0,32,172,3,9.6
obama_sotu_02_022,Obama,SOTU,02,22,"It was about as popular as a root canal. [Laughter] But when I ran for President, I promised I wouldn't just do what was popular; I would do what was necessary.

obama_sotu_02_023,Obama,SOTU,02,23,More businesses would certainly have closed. More homes would have surely been lost. So I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program.,0,26,173,3,7.8
obama_sotu_02_024,Obama,SOTU,02,24,"And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable. And as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banks-- most but not all.",0,40,214,2,12.0
obama_sotu_02_025,Obama,SOTU,02,25,"To recover the rest, I've proposed a fee on the biggest banks. Now, I know Wall Street isn't keen on this idea.",0,22,111,2,6.6
obama_sotu_02_026,Obama,SOTU,02,26,"But if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need. Now, as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help Americans who had become unemployed. That's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans, made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRA, and passed 25 different tax cuts.",0,95,549,3,28.5
obama_sotu_02_027,Obama,SOTU,02,27,"Now, let me repeat: We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. We cut taxes for small businesses.",0,22,117,3,6.6
obama_sotu_02_028,Obama,SOTU,02,28,We cut taxes for first-time home buyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college.,0,28,157,3,8.4
obama_sotu_02_029,Obama,SOTU,02,29,"[Applause ] I thought I'd get some applause on that one. [Laughter] As a result, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers. And we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person--not a single dime.",0,54,300,3,16.2
obama_sotu_02_030,Obama,SOTU,02,30,"Now, because of the steps we took, there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed. Two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy. Three hundred thousand are teachers and other education workers.",0,39,248,3,11.7
obama_sotu_02_031,Obama,SOTU,02,31,"Tens of thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, first-responders. And we're on track to add another 1 1/2 million jobs to this total by the end of the year. The plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the Recovery Act.",0,49,270,3,14.7
obama_sotu_02_032,Obama,SOTU,02,32,"That's right, the Recovery Act, also known as the stimulus bill. Economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster.",0,28,156,2,8.4
obama_sotu_02_033,Obama,SOTU,02,33,"But you don't have to take their word for it. Talk to the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the Recovery Act. Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the Recovery Act, until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created.",0,61,330,3,18.3
obama_sotu_02_034,Obama,SOTU,02,34,"Talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the Recovery Act, she wouldn't be laid off after all. There are stories like this all across America. And after 2 years of recession, the economy is growing again.",0,52,280,3,15.6
obama_sotu_02_035,Obama,SOTU,02,35,"Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly some are starting to hire again.",0,25,149,2,7.5
obama_sotu_02_036,Obama,SOTU,02,36,"But I realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from, who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response.",0,44,238,1,13.2
obama_sotu_02_037,Obama,SOTU,02,37,"That is why jobs must be our number-one focus in 2010, and that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight. Now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's businesses. [Applause ] I agree, absolutely.",0,42,233,3,12.6
obama_sotu_02_038,Obama,SOTU,02,38,"But Government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers. We should start where most new jobs do, in small businesses, companies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker decides it's time she became her own boss. Through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the recession, and they're ready to grow.",0,65,393,3,19.5
obama_sotu_02_039,Obama,SOTU,02,39,"But when you talk to small-business owners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, they're mostly lending to bigger companies. Financing remains difficult for small-business owners across the country, even those that are making a profit. So tonight I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat.",0,84,511,3,25.2
obama_sotu_02_040,Obama,SOTU,02,40,"I'm also proposing a new small business tax credit, one that will go to over 1 million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages. While we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small-business investment and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment. Next, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow.",0,73,432,3,21.9
obama_sotu_02_041,Obama,SOTU,02,41,"From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System, our Nation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products. Tomorrow I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act.",0,58,359,3,17.4
obama_sotu_02_042,Obama,SOTU,02,42,"There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our Nation's goods, services, and information. We should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy efficient, which supports clean energy jobs. And to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America.",0,96,570,3,28.8
obama_sotu_02_043,Obama,SOTU,02,43,"Now, the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps. As the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same, and I know they will. They will.",0,37,181,3,11.1
obama_sotu_02_044,Obama,SOTU,02,44,People are out of work. They're hurting. They need our help.,0,11,60,3,3.3

obama_sotu_02_046,Obama,SOTU,02,46,"But the truth is, these steps won't make up for the 7 million jobs that we've lost over the last 2 years. The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth and finally address the problems that America's families have confronted for years. We can't afford another so-called economic expansion like the one from the last decade, what some call the ""lost decade,"" where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion, where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs, where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation.",0,113,667,3,33.9
obama_sotu_02_047,Obama,SOTU,02,47,"From the day I took office, I've been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious; such an effort would be too contentious. I've been told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for a while.",0,46,254,2,13.8
obama_sotu_02_048,Obama,SOTU,02,48,"For those who make these claims, I have one simple question: How long should we wait? How long should America put its future on hold? You see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse.",0,43,233,3,12.9
obama_sotu_02_049,Obama,SOTU,02,49,"Meanwhile, China's not waiting to revamp its economy. Germany's not waiting. India's not waiting.",0,14,97,3,4.2
obama_sotu_02_050,Obama,SOTU,02,50,These nations are-- they're not standing still. These nations aren't playing for second place. They're putting more emphasis on math and science.,0,22,145,3,6.6

obama_sotu_02_052,Obama,SOTU,02,52,"As hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth. Now, one place to start is serious financial reform. Look, I am not interested in punishing banks.",0,46,262,3,13.8
obama_sotu_02_053,Obama,SOTU,02,53,"I'm interested in protecting our economy. A strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes.",0,34,220,3,10.2
obama_sotu_02_054,Obama,SOTU,02,54,"But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy. We need to make sure consumers and middle class families have the information they need to make financial decisions. We can't allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy.",0,57,355,3,17.1
obama_sotu_02_055,Obama,SOTU,02,55,"Now, the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes, and the lobbyists are trying to kill it.",0,21,119,1,6.3
obama_sotu_02_056,Obama,SOTU,02,56,"But we cannot let them win this fight. And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, I will send it back until we get it right. We've got to get it right.",0,42,187,3,12.6
obama_sotu_02_057,Obama,SOTU,02,57,"Next, we need to encourage American innovation. Last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history, an investment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells, but leaves healthy ones untouched. And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy.",0,53,324,3,15.9
obama_sotu_02_058,Obama,SOTU,02,58,"You can see the results of last year's investments in clean energy in the North Carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries or in the California business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels.",0,44,261,1,13.2
obama_sotu_02_059,Obama,SOTU,02,59,"But to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives. And that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country. It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development.",0,48,293,3,14.4
obama_sotu_02_060,Obama,SOTU,02,60,"It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies. And yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America. Now, I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year.",0,51,306,3,15.3
obama_sotu_02_061,Obama,SOTU,02,61,"And this year, I'm eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate. I know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy. I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change.",0,47,273,3,14.1
obama_sotu_02_062,Obama,SOTU,02,62,"But here's the thing: Even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future, because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy. And America must be that nation. Third, we need to export more of our goods, because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America.",0,80,448,3,24.0
obama_sotu_02_063,Obama,SOTU,02,63,"So tonight we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next 5 years, an increase that will support 2 million jobs in America.",0,27,136,1,8.1
obama_sotu_02_064,Obama,SOTU,02,64,"To help meet this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security.",0,29,197,1,8.7

obama_sotu_02_066,Obama,SOTU,02,66,"But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules. And that's why we'll continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama and Colombia. Fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people.",0,66,385,3,19.8
obama_sotu_02_067,Obama,SOTU,02,67,"Now, this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools. And the idea here is simple: Instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform, reform that raises student achievement, inspires students to excel in math and science, and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans, from rural communities to the inner city.",0,80,491,3,24.0
obama_sotu_02_068,Obama,SOTU,02,68,"In the 21st century, the best antipoverty program around is a world-class education. And in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential.",0,33,196,2,9.9
obama_sotu_02_069,Obama,SOTU,02,69,"When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 States. Still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job.

obama_sotu_02_070,Obama,SOTU,02,70,"To make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans. Instead, let's take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for 4 years of college and increase Pell grants. And let's tell another 1 million students that when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college.",0,111,620,3,33.3
obama_sotu_02_071,Obama,SOTU,02,71,"And by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs, because they too have a responsibility to help solve this problem.

obama_sotu_02_072,Obama,SOTU,02,72,"That's why we're nearly doubling the childcare tax credit and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg. That's why we're working to lift the value of a family's single largest investment, their home.

obama_sotu_02_074,Obama,SOTU,02,74,"Now, let's clear a few things up. I didn't choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt. And by now it should be fairly obvious that I didn't take on health care because it was good politics.",0,42,220,3,12.6
obama_sotu_02_075,Obama,SOTU,02,75,"[Laughter] I took on health care because of the stories I've heard from Americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage, patients who've been denied coverage, families, even those with insurance, who are just one illness away from financial ruin.",0,42,275,1,12.6
obama_sotu_02_076,Obama,SOTU,02,76,"After nearly a century of trying--Democratic administrations, Republican administrations--we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans.
