At this moment—with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy production—we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.

Like millions of hard-working Americans, Rebekah isn't asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.

obama_sotu_01_031,Obama,SOTU,01,31,"We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet, tools they needed to go as far as their efforts and their dreams will take them. That's what middle class economics is: the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everyone plays by the same set of rules.",0,75,457,3,22.5

obama_sotu_01_033,Obama,SOTU,01,33,"That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement. And my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year. Here's one example.",0,41,260,3,12.3
obama_sotu_01_034,Obama,SOTU,01,34,"During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority, so this country provided universal childcare. In today's economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. It's not a nice-to-have, it's a must-have.",0,64,404,3,19.2
obama_sotu_01_035,Obama,SOTU,01,35,"So it's time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or as a women's issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us. And that's why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle class and low-income family with young children in America, by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year. Here's another example.",0,77,419,3,23.1
obama_sotu_01_036,Obama,SOTU,01,36,"Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave—43 million. Think about that.",0,34,209,3,10.2
obama_sotu_01_037,Obama,SOTU,01,37,"And that forces too many parents to make the gut- wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I'll be taking new action to help States adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let's put it to a vote right here in Washington.",0,61,310,3,18.3
obama_sotu_01_038,Obama,SOTU,01,38,Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn 7 days of paid sick leave. It's the right thing to do. [Applause ] It's the right thing to do.,0,34,168,3,10.2
obama_sotu_01_039,Obama,SOTU,01,39,"Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That's why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. I mean, it's 2015.",0,42,212,3,12.6
obama_sotu_01_040,Obama,SOTU,01,40,"[Laughter] It's time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they've earned.

obama_sotu_01_041,Obama,SOTU,01,41,"If not, vote to give millions of the hardest working people in America a raise. Now, these ideas won't make everybody rich, won't relieve every hardship. That's not the job of government.",0,32,187,3,9.6
obama_sotu_01_042,Obama,SOTU,01,42,"To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter's earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company's long-term interest. We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice.",0,47,291,2,14.1
obama_sotu_01_043,Obama,SOTU,01,43,"But you know, things like childcare and sick leave and equal pay, things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage—these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. That's a fact. And that's what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do.",0,53,308,3,15.9

It's not fair to them, and it's sure not smart for our future.",0,53,284,3,15.9
obama_sotu_01_048,Obama,SOTU,01,48,"And that's why I'm sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero. Keep in mind, 40 percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out.",0,38,212,3,11.4
obama_sotu_01_049,Obama,SOTU,01,49,"Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt.",0,43,232,3,12.9
obama_sotu_01_050,Obama,SOTU,01,50,"Understand, you've got to earn it. You've got to keep your grades up and graduate on time. Tennessee, a State with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible.",0,38,238,3,11.4
obama_sotu_01_051,Obama,SOTU,01,51,I want to spread that idea all across America so that 2 years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today.

obama_sotu_01_064,Obama,SOTU,01,64,"It's the right thing to do. Look, I'm the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype, and that's why we've gone after countries that break the rules at our expense.",0,38,198,2,11.4
obama_sotu_01_065,Obama,SOTU,01,65,But 95 percent of the world's customers live outside our borders. We can't close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they're actively looking to bring jobs back from China.,0,36,229,3,10.8
