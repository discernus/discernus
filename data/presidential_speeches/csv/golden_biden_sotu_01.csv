biden_sotu_01_003,Biden,SOTU,01,3,"As Mitch and Chuck will understand, it's good to be almost home, down the hall. [Laughter] Anyway, thank you all. Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President—no President has ever said those words from this podium.",0,34,206,3,10.2
biden_sotu_01_004,Biden,SOTU,01,4,"No President has ever said those words, and it's about time. First Lady—I'm her husband; Second Gentleman; Chief Justice; Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet; distinguished guests; my fellow Americans: While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is just a little bit different, a reminder of the extraordinary times we're in. Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this Chamber to speak to Congress, to the Nation, and to the world; to declare war, to celebrate peace; to announce new plans and possibilities.",0,87,546,3,26.1
biden_sotu_01_005,Biden,SOTU,01,5,"Tonight I come to talk about crisis and opportunity, about rebuilding the Nation, revitalizing our democracy, and winning the future for America. I stand here tonight, 1 day shy of the hundredth day of my administration, hundred days since I took the oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a Nation—we all did—that was in crisis: the worst pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the Nation: America is on the move again, turning peril into possibility, crisis to opportunity, setbacks into strength.",0,113,664,3,33.9

biden_sotu_01_009,Biden,SOTU,01,9,"We have shown each other and the world that there's no quit in America—none. One hundred days ago, America's house was on fire. And we had to act.",0,28,146,3,8.4
biden_sotu_01_010,Biden,SOTU,01,10,"And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi; Majority Leader Schumer; and the overwhelming support of the American people— Democrats, Independents, and Republicans—we did act. Together we passed the American Rescue Plan, one of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We're already seeing the results.",0,48,338,3,14.4

Thanks to all the help of all of you, we're marshaling—with your help, everyone's help—we're marshaling every Federal resource. We've gotten vaccines to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers where the poorest of the poor can be reached.",0,70,424,3,21.0

One hundred days later, 70 percent of seniors in America over 65 are protected—fully protected. Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80 percent since January—down 80 percent—because of all of you.",0,53,317,3,15.9
biden_sotu_01_016,Biden,SOTU,01,16,"And more than half of all the adults in America have gotten at least one shot. At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked the nurse—I said, ""What's it like?"" She looked at me, and she said, ""It's like every shot is giving a dose of hope""—was her phrase. ""A dose of hope."" A dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune disease—wrote to me, said she's worried—that she was worrying about bringing the virus home.",0,86,467,5,25.8
biden_sotu_01_017,Biden,SOTU,01,17,"She said she then got vaccinated at a large site, in her car. She said she sat in her car, when she got vaccinated and just cried, cried out of joy and cried out of relief. Parents seeing the smiles on their kids' faces, for those who are able to go back to school because the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated.",0,67,352,3,20.1

biden_sotu_01_020,Biden,SOTU,01,20,"But tonight I can say it: Because of you, the American people, our progress these past hundred days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical achievements—logistical achievements— this country has ever seen. What else have we done in those first hundred days? We kept our commitment—Democrats and Republicans—of sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households.",0,66,422,3,19.8
biden_sotu_01_021,Biden,SOTU,01,21,We've already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. It's making the difference. You all know it when you go home.,0,23,123,3,6.9
biden_sotu_01_022,Biden,SOTU,01,22,"For many people, it's making all the difference in the world. The single mom in Texas who wrote to me, she said she couldn't work, but she said the relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment. A grandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor, something she said she put off for months because she didn't have the money.",0,77,417,3,23.1
biden_sotu_01_023,Biden,SOTU,01,23,"One of the defining images, at least from my perspective, in this crisis has been cars lined up, cars lined up for miles. And not people who just barely ever start those cars, nice cars lined up for miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk. I don't know about you, but I didn't ever think I'd see that in America.",0,66,330,3,19.8
biden_sotu_01_024,Biden,SOTU,01,24,"And all of this is through no fault of their own. No fault of their own, these people are in this position. That's why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already.",0,45,254,3,13.5
biden_sotu_01_025,Biden,SOTU,01,25,"We're also providing rental assistance—you all know this, but the American people, I want to make sure they understand—keeping people from being evicted from their homes, providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the job. During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act when I established the special signup period to do that —800,000 in that period. We're making one of the largest one-time ever investments—ever—in improving health care for veterans.",0,82,527,3,24.6
biden_sotu_01_026,Biden,SOTU,01,26,"Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we're on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. And, in the process, while this was all going on, the economy created more than 1,300,000 new jobs in 100 days, more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record.",0,63,355,3,18.9

biden_sotu_01_028,Biden,SOTU,01,28,America is moving—moving forward—but we can't stop now. We're in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century. We're at a great inflection point in history.,0,29,178,3,8.7

biden_sotu_01_030,Biden,SOTU,01,30,"We have to compete more strenuously than we have. Throughout our history, if you think about it, public investment in infrastructure has literally transformed America: our attitudes, as well as our opportunities. The transcontinental railroad, the interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United States of America.",0,55,360,3,16.5
biden_sotu_01_031,Biden,SOTU,01,31,"Universal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon—now we're on Mars—discovering vaccines, gave us the internet, and so much more. These are the investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the Government was in a position to make.",0,53,330,3,15.9
biden_sotu_01_032,Biden,SOTU,01,32,"Time and again, they propel us into the future. That's why I proposed the American Jobs Plan, a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. This is the largest jobs plan since World War II.",0,33,196,3,9.9
biden_sotu_01_033,Biden,SOTU,01,33,"It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure; jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways; jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors, transit lines. It's clean water. And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water, a clear and present danger to our children's health.",0,62,401,3,18.6
biden_sotu_01_034,Biden,SOTU,01,34,"The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the Nation's lead pipes and service lines so every American can drink clean water.

It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn't have it.",0,58,362,3,17.4
biden_sotu_01_035,Biden,SOTU,01,35,"This is going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st-century economy. And I'm asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would—— Vice President Kamala D. Harris .",0,34,190,3,10.2

biden_sotu_01_037,Biden,SOTU,01,37,"It creates jobs, building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, catastrophic failures, with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter storms. The American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid.",0,56,337,3,16.8
biden_sotu_01_038,Biden,SOTU,01,38,"We can do that. Look, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careers. Two million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic—2 million, and too often because they couldn't get the care they needed to care for their child or care for an elderly parent who needs help.",0,62,338,3,18.6

The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy-efficient buildings and homes; electrical workers— IBEW members—installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways so we can own the electric car market.
