bush_sotu_01_002,Bush,SOTU,01,2,"Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, members of the Supreme Court and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: Today our Nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous woman who called America to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream.",0,42,278,1,12.6
bush_sotu_01_003,Bush,SOTU,01,3,"Tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was taken so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of Coretta Scott King. Every time I'm invited to this rostrum, I'm humbled by the privilege and mindful of the history we've seen together.",0,52,276,2,15.6
bush_sotu_01_004,Bush,SOTU,01,4,We have gathered under this Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement.,0,15,98,1,4.5
bush_sotu_01_005,Bush,SOTU,01,5,"We have served America through one of the most consequential periods of our history, and it has been my honor to serve with you. In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there will always be differences and debate.",0,43,241,2,12.9
bush_sotu_01_006,Bush,SOTU,01,6,"But even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger.",0,21,116,1,6.3

bush_sotu_01_010,Bush,SOTU,01,10,"We will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world economy, or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity. In a complex and challenging time, the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting, yet it ends in danger and decline. The only way to protect our people, the only way to secure the peace, the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership.",0,69,388,3,20.7
bush_sotu_01_011,Bush,SOTU,01,11,"So the United States of America will continue to lead. Abroad, our Nation is committed to an historic, long-term goal: We seek the end of tyranny in our world. Some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism.",0,36,205,3,10.8
bush_sotu_01_012,Bush,SOTU,01,12,"In reality, the future security of America depends on it. On September the 11th, 2001, we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state 7,000 miles away could bring murder and destruction to our country. Dictatorships shelter terrorists, and feed resentment and radicalism, and seek weapons of mass destruction.",0,51,330,3,15.3
bush_sotu_01_013,Bush,SOTU,01,13,"Democracies replace resentment with hope, respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight against terror. Every step toward freedom in the world makes our country safer, so we will act boldly in freedom's cause. Far from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great story of our time.",0,56,328,3,16.8
bush_sotu_01_014,Bush,SOTU,01,14,"In 1945, there were about two dozen lonely democracies in the world. Today, there are 122. And we're writing a new chapter in the story of self-government—with women lining up to vote in Afghanistan, and millions of Iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink, and men and women from Lebanon to Egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of freedom.",0,62,366,3,18.6
bush_sotu_01_015,Bush,SOTU,01,15,"At the start of 2006, more than half the people of our world live in democratic nations. And we do not forget the other half—in places like Syria and Burma, Zimbabwe, North Korea, and Iran—because the demands of justice and the peace of this world require their freedom as well. No one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight against it.",0,66,358,3,19.8
bush_sotu_01_016,Bush,SOTU,01,16,"And one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is radical Islam—the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death. Terrorists like bin Laden are serious about mass murder, and all of us must take their declared intentions seriously. They seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the Middle East and arm themselves with weapons of mass murder.",0,69,406,3,20.7
bush_sotu_01_017,Bush,SOTU,01,17,"Their aim is to seize power in Iraq and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks against America and the world. Lacking the military strength to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear.",0,39,214,2,11.7
bush_sotu_01_018,Bush,SOTU,01,18,"When they murder children at a school in Beslan or blow up commuters in London or behead a bound captive, the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will, allowing the violent to inherit the Earth.",0,36,203,1,10.8
bush_sotu_01_019,Bush,SOTU,01,19,"But they have miscalculated: We love our freedom, and we will fight to keep it. In a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our commitments and retreating within our borders. If we were to leave these vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone.",0,48,272,3,14.4
bush_sotu_01_020,Bush,SOTU,01,20,"They would simply move the battlefield to our own shores. There is no peace in retreat, and there is no honor in retreat. By allowing radical Islam to work its will, by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself, we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals or even in our own courage.",0,60,310,3,18.0
bush_sotu_01_021,Bush,SOTU,01,21,"But our enemies and our friends can be certain: The United States will not retreat from the world, and we will never surrender to evil.",0,25,135,1,7.5

Once again, we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed and move this world toward peace. We remain on the offensive against terror networks.",0,50,288,3,15.0
bush_sotu_01_024,Bush,SOTU,01,24,"We have killed or captured many of their leaders. And for the others, their day will come. We remain on the offensive in Afghanistan, where a fine President and a National Assembly are fighting terror while building the institutions of a new democracy.",0,43,252,3,12.9
bush_sotu_01_025,Bush,SOTU,01,25,"We're on the offensive in Iraq with a clear plan for victory. First, we're helping Iraqis build an inclusive government, so that old resentments will be eased and the insurgency will be marginalized. Second, we're continuing reconstruction efforts and helping the Iraqi Government to fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all Iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom.",0,60,382,3,18.0
bush_sotu_01_026,Bush,SOTU,01,26,"And third, we're striking terrorist targets while we train Iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating the enemy. Iraqis are showing their courage every day, and we are proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom. Our work in Iraq is difficult because our enemy is brutal.",0,50,289,3,15.0
bush_sotu_01_027,Bush,SOTU,01,27,"But that brutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy. In less than 3 years, the nation has gone from dictatorship to liberation, to sovereignty, to a Constitution, to national elections. At the same time, our coalition has been relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgent strongholds, and turning over territory to Iraqi security forces.",0,60,390,3,18.0
bush_sotu_01_028,Bush,SOTU,01,28,"I am confident in our plan for victory; I am confident in the will of the Iraqi people; I am confident in the skill and spirit of our military. Fellow citizens, we are in this fight to win, and we are winning. The road of victory is the road that will take our troops home.",0,55,273,3,16.5
bush_sotu_01_029,Bush,SOTU,01,29,"As we make progress on the ground and Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead, we should be able to further decrease our troop levels.",0,24,134,1,7.2
bush_sotu_01_030,Bush,SOTU,01,30,"But those decisions will be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, DC. Our coalition has learned from our experience in Iraq. We've adjusted our military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction.",0,36,233,3,10.8
bush_sotu_01_031,Bush,SOTU,01,31,"Along the way, we have benefited from responsible criticism and counsel offered by Members of Congress of both parties. In the coming year, I will continue to reach out and seek your good advice. Yet there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for success and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure.",0,55,337,3,16.5
bush_sotu_01_032,Bush,SOTU,01,32,"Hindsight alone is not wisdom, and second-guessing is not a strategy. With so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty to speak with candor. A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would abandon our Iraqi allies to death and prison, would put men like bin Laden and Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country, and show that a pledge from America means little.",0,70,382,3,21.0
bush_sotu_01_033,Bush,SOTU,01,33,"Members of Congress, however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past, our Nation has only one option: We must keep our word, defeat our enemies, and stand behind the American military in this vital mission. Our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices and showing a sense of duty stronger than all fear. They know what it's like to fight house to house in a maze of streets, to wear heavy gear in the desert heat, to see a comrade killed by a roadside bomb.",0,89,475,3,26.7
bush_sotu_01_034,Bush,SOTU,01,34,"And those who know the costs also know the stakes. Marine Staff Sergeant Dan Clay was killed last month fighting in Fallujah. He left behind a letter to his family, but his words could just as well be addressed to every American.",0,42,229,3,12.6
bush_sotu_01_035,Bush,SOTU,01,35,"Here is what Dan wrote: ""I know what honor is— it has been an honor to protect and serve all of you. I faced death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to. Never falter.",0,37,182,3,11.1

Staff Sergeant Dan Clay's wife, Lisa, and his mom and dad, Sara Jo and Bud, are with us this evening. Welcome. Our Nation is grateful to the fallen, who live in the memory of our country.",0,56,301,4,16.8
bush_sotu_01_037,Bush,SOTU,01,37,"We're grateful to all who volunteer to wear our Nation's uniform. And as we honor our brave troops, let us never forget the sacrifices of America's military families. Our offensive against terror involves more than military action.",0,37,231,3,11.1
bush_sotu_01_038,Bush,SOTU,01,38,"Ultimately, the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful change. So the United States of America supports democratic reform across the broader Middle East. Elections are vital, but they are only the beginning.",0,52,322,3,15.6
bush_sotu_01_039,Bush,SOTU,01,39,"Raising up a democracy requires the rule of law and protection of minorities and strong, accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote. The great people of Egypt have voted in a multiparty Presidential election, and now their Government should open paths of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism. The Palestinian people have voted in elections, and now the leaders of Hamas must recognize Israel, disarm, reject terrorism, and work for lasting peace.",0,77,489,3,23.1
bush_sotu_01_040,Bush,SOTU,01,40,"Saudi Arabia has taken the first steps of reform; now it can offer its people a better future by pressing forward with those efforts. Democracies in the Middle East will not look like our own, because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens. Yet liberty is the future of every nation in the Middle East because liberty is the right and hope of all humanity.",0,67,372,3,20.1
bush_sotu_01_041,Bush,SOTU,01,41,"The same is true of Iran, a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elite that is isolating and repressing its people. The regime in that country sponsors terrorists in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon, and that must come to an end. The Iranian Government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions, and the nations of the world must not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons.",0,71,407,3,21.3
bush_sotu_01_042,Bush,SOTU,01,42,America will continue to rally the world to confront these threats.,0,11,67,1,3.3

We respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom. And our Nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends with a free and democratic Iran.",0,50,270,3,15.0
bush_sotu_01_044,Bush,SOTU,01,44,"To overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by encouraging economic progress and fighting disease and spreading hope in hopeless lands. Isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting enemies, it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need. We show compassion abroad because Americans believe in the God-given dignity and worth of a villager with HIV/AIDS or an infant with malaria or a refugee fleeing genocide or a young girl sold into slavery.",0,81,487,3,24.3
bush_sotu_01_045,Bush,SOTU,01,45,"We also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by poverty, corruption, and despair are sources of terrorism and organized crime and human trafficking and the drug trade. In recent years, you and I have taken unprecedented action to fight AIDS and malaria, expand the education of girls, and reward developing nations that are moving forward with economic and political reform.",0,60,388,2,18.0
bush_sotu_01_046,Bush,SOTU,01,46,"For people everywhere, the United States is a partner for a better life. Shortchanging these efforts would increase the suffering and chaos of our world, undercut our long-term security, and dull the conscience of our country. I urge Members of Congress to serve the interests of America by showing the compassion of America.",0,53,325,3,15.9
bush_sotu_01_047,Bush,SOTU,01,47,"Our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home. The enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us. Fortunately, this Nation has superb professionals in law enforcement, intelligence, the military, and homeland security.",0,40,260,3,12.0
bush_sotu_01_048,Bush,SOTU,01,48,"These men and women are dedicating their lives, protecting us all, and they deserve our support and our thanks. They also deserve the same tools they already use to fight drug trafficking and organized crime, so I ask you to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. It is said that prior to the attacks of September the 11th, our Government failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy.",0,66,374,3,19.8
bush_sotu_01_049,Bush,SOTU,01,49,We now know that two of the hijackers in the United States placed telephone calls to Al Qaida operatives overseas.,0,20,114,1,6.0
bush_sotu_01_050,Bush,SOTU,01,50,"But we did not know about their plans until it was too late. So to prevent another attack—based on authority given to me by the Constitution and by statute—I have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected Al Qaida operatives and affiliates to and from America. Previous Presidents have used the same constitutional authority I have, and Federal courts have approved the use of that authority.",0,72,463,3,21.6
bush_sotu_01_051,Bush,SOTU,01,51,Appropriate Members of Congress have been kept informed. The terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks. It remains essential to the security of America.,0,25,178,3,7.5
bush_sotu_01_052,Bush,SOTU,01,52,"If there are people inside our country who are talking with Al Qaida, we want to know about it, because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again. In all these areas—from the disruption of terror networks, to victory in Iraq, to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions—we need the support of our friends and allies.",0,62,330,2,18.6
bush_sotu_01_053,Bush,SOTU,01,53,"To draw that support, we must always be clear in our principles and willing to act. The only alternative to American leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world. Yet we also choose to lead because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth.",0,49,272,3,14.7
bush_sotu_01_054,Bush,SOTU,01,54,"American leaders—from Roosevelt to Truman to Kennedy to Reagan —rejected isolation and retreat, because they knew that America is always more secure when freedom is on the march. Our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy, a war that will be fought by Presidents of both parties who will need steady bipartisan support from the Congress. And tonight I ask for yours.",0,66,386,3,19.8
bush_sotu_01_055,Bush,SOTU,01,55,"Together, let us protect our country, support the men and women who defend us, and lead this world toward freedom. Here at home, America also has a great opportunity: We will build the prosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the world. Our economy is healthy and vigorous and growing faster than other major industrialized nations.",0,59,361,3,17.7
bush_sotu_01_056,Bush,SOTU,01,56,"In the last 2 1/2 years, America has created 4.6 million new jobs, more than Japan and the European Union combined. Even in the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters, the American people have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world. The American economy is preeminent, but we cannot afford to be complacent.",0,60,344,4,18.0
bush_sotu_01_057,Bush,SOTU,01,57,"In a dynamic world economy, we are seeing new competitors like China and India, and this creates uncertainty, which makes it easier to feed people's fears. So we're seeing some old temptations return. Protectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy.",0,53,330,3,15.9
bush_sotu_01_058,Bush,SOTU,01,58,"Others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy, centralizing more power in Washington and increasing taxes. We hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy, even though this economy could not function without them. All these are forms of economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction, toward a stagnant and second-rate economy.",0,63,387,3,18.9
bush_sotu_01_059,Bush,SOTU,01,59,Tonight I will set out a better path: an agenda for a nation that competes with confidence; an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate new jobs.

bush_sotu_01_060,Bush,SOTU,01,60,"And our economy grows when Americans have more of their own money to spend, save, and invest. In the last 5 years, the tax relief you passed has left $880 billion in the hands of American workers, investors, small businesses, and families. And they have used it to help produce more than 4 years of uninterrupted economic growth.",0,58,329,3,17.4
bush_sotu_01_061,Bush,SOTU,01,61,"Yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next few years.

bush_sotu_01_062,Bush,SOTU,01,62,"Keeping America competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax dollars. Every year of my Presidency, we've reduced the growth of nonsecurity discretionary spending, and last year, you passed bills that cut this spending. This year, my budget will cut it again and reduce or eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling essential priorities.",0,60,377,3,18.0
