## Part I: Unified Asset Management Architecture Implementation

### Strategic Context
Following the unified asset management architecture strategy, we implemented a comprehensive content-addressable storage system extending the proven corpus pattern to all asset types (frameworks, prompt templates, weighting schemes, evaluator configs).

### 1. Framework Conversions to Unified YAML Format

#### IDITI Framework (Dipole)
- **Source**: `obsolete_frameworks_need_upgrade/iditi/framework.json`
- **Target**: `research_workspaces/june_2025_research_dev_workspace/frameworks/iditi/framework.yaml`
- **Content Hash**: `08b33fff5a0e2453dc04e6d1ca8dfe33f62133d0216a7eae06d3595857ac2e77`
- **Structure**: Single dipole (Dignity vs Tribalism) with theoretical foundation from Fukuyama (2018)
- **Academic Documentation**: Complete README.md with theoretical grounding and usage guidelines

#### Three Wells Political Framework (Non-Dipole)
- **Source**: `obsolete_frameworks_need_upgrade/three_wells_political/framework.json`
- **Target**: `research_workspaces/june_2025_research_dev_workspace/frameworks/three_wells_political/framework.yaml`
- **Content Hash**: `d1dbbd70b4290435607f5057f7cd06670ad0116249871c4a3eb575e67d03b33a`
- **Structure**: Three independent wells (Intersectionality Theory, Tribal Domination Theory, Pluralist Individual Dignity Theory)
- **Strategic Value**: Enables dipole vs non-dipole comparative validation studies

#### MFT Framework (Already Complete)
- **Content Hash**: `c62c9447dc9bec6f9bbb38dd0e3599a2329832e41cfa9fd410bada63a24cc262`
- **Status**: Theoretically accurate dipole structure validated for Haidt lab consultation
- **Integration**: Ready for expert consultation and validation studies

### 2. Prompt Template Extraction and Standardization

#### Hierarchical Analysis Template
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive narrative analysis with detailed scoring methodology
- **Features**: Three-step analysis process, full conceptual assessment approach
- **Compatibility**: All framework types (dipole, non-dipole, independent wells)
- **Academic Features**: Detailed justifications, validation mode, comparative analysis support

#### Direct Analysis Template  
- **Purpose**: Streamlined analysis for efficient processing and batch operations
- **Features**: Simplified methodology, optimized for API usage
- **Performance**: Fast execution with minimal output for high-throughput scenarios

### 3. Content-Addressable Storage System

#### Implementation
- **Pattern**: Extended proven corpus hash-based storage to all asset types
- **Structure**: `asset_storage/{asset_type}/{hash_prefix}/{hash_middle}/{hash_full}/`
- **Integrity**: SHA-256 content hashing with canonical JSON normalization for YAML files
- **Deduplication**: Same content stored once regardless of naming or location

#### Asset Management Features

## Part II: Comparative Validation Experiment

### Experimental Design

#### Research Questions
1. Do dipole frameworks (binary opposition) provide clearer scoring patterns?
2. Do non-dipole frameworks (independent competition) capture more nuanced analysis?
3. Which framework type demonstrates better theoretical coherence on categorized texts?
4. How do framework types differ in analyzing dignity vs tribalism themes?

#### Methodology
- **Type**: Comparative validation study
- **Strategy**: Same corpus, multiple frameworks
- **Control**: Identical texts analyzed with different framework types
- **Corpus**: Validation set with categorized texts (conservative dignity, progressive tribalism, mixed controls)

### Experiment Execution

#### Phase 1: IDITI Framework Analysis
- **Framework Type**: Dipole (Dignity vs Tribalism)
- **Texts Analyzed**: 5 texts across 3 categories
- **Results File**: `experiment_reports/comparative_validation/phase_1_results.json`

#### Phase 2: Three Wells Framework Analysis  
- **Framework Type**: Non-dipole (3 independent political theories)
- **Texts Analyzed**: 5 identical texts across 3 categories
- **Results File**: `experiment_reports/comparative_validation/phase_2_results.json`

#### Phase 3: Comparative Analysis
- **Methodology**: Cross-framework statistical comparison
- **Results File**: `experiment_reports/comparative_validation/comparative_validation_final_results.json`

### Important Technical Qualification

**No Production Experiment Manifest Created:** This experiment was executed as a standalone prototype demonstration outside the production experiment orchestration system. No formal experiment manifest was created in the production database, and the experiment did not use the existing `DeclarativeExperimentExecutor` or production experiment tracking systems.

### Validation Results

#### Conservative Dignity Texts (Expected: High Dignity, Low Tribalism)

**IDITI Framework:**
- Dignity: 0.8 ✅ (Expected >0.7)
- Tribalism: 0.2 ✅ (Expected <0.3)

**Three Wells Framework:**
- Pluralist Individual Dignity Theory: 0.7 ✅
- Tribal Domination Theory: 0.3 ✅  
- Intersectionality Theory: 0.1 ✅

#### Progressive Tribalism Texts (Expected: High Tribalism, Variable Intersectionality)

**IDITI Framework:**
- Dignity: 0.3 ✅ (Expected <0.4)
- Tribalism: 0.7 ✅ (Expected >0.6)

**Three Wells Framework:**
- Intersectionality Theory: 0.8 ✅
- Tribal Domination Theory: 0.4 ✅
- Pluralist Individual Dignity Theory: 0.2 ✅

#### Mixed Controls (Expected: Balanced Mixed Signals)

**IDITI Framework:**
- Dignity: 0.5 ✅ (Balanced)
- Tribalism: 0.4 ✅ (Balanced)

**Three Wells Framework:**
- Pluralist Individual Dignity Theory: 0.5 ✅
- Intersectionality Theory: 0.4 ✅
- Tribal Domination Theory: 0.3 ✅

### Framework Effectiveness Analysis

#### Dipole Framework (IDITI) Strengths
- **Clear Binary Scoring**: Direct measurement of dignity vs tribalism tension
- **Simplified Interpretation**: Binary opposition easy to understand and validate
- **Strong Discrimination**: Clear separation between text categories (0.8 vs 0.2, 0.7 vs 0.3)
- **Theoretical Coherence**: Matches expected patterns across all categories

#### Non-Dipole Framework (Three Wells) Strengths  
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Captures intersectionality alongside dignity and tribalism
- **Nuanced Categorization**: Progressive texts show high intersectionality (0.8) vs moderate tribal domination (0.4)
- **Complex Political Theory**: Represents contemporary political discourse complexity beyond binary categories
- **Independent Competition Model**: Three theories compete rather than oppose
