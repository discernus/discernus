# Agent Registry Cleanup - July 22, 2025

## Summary
Investigated and resolved agent registry inconsistencies by removing references to missing agent files and updating documentation to accurately reflect the current production pipeline.

## Background
During investigation of Experiment 3's production workflow, discovered that the agent registry referenced several agents with missing source files:
- StatisticalAnalysisAgent (only .pyc file existed)
- StatisticalInterpretationAgent (only .pyc file existed) 
- JsonExtractionAgent (no implementation found)

## Work Performed

### Investigation Phase
1. **Analyzed Experiment 3 workflow**: Identified actual production pipeline as AnalysisAgent → DataExtractionAgent → CalculationAgent → SynthesisAgent
2. **Compared agent functionality**: Determined functional overlap between missing and existing agents
3. **Verified source files**: Confirmed which agents had actual implementations

### Registry Updates
1. **Removed obsolete entries**:
   - StatisticalAnalysisAgent (missing source, functionality absorbed by CalculationAgent)
   - StatisticalInterpretationAgent (missing source, functionality likely absorbed by SynthesisAgent)
   - JsonExtractionAgent (missing source, functionality completely absorbed by DataExtractionAgent)

2. **Enhanced existing documentation**:
   - Added complete DataExtractionAgent specification with archetype, description, inputs/outputs
   - Added explanatory comments about agent evolution

3. **Verified integrity**: Confirmed all 11 remaining agents have corresponding source files

## Key Findings

### Functional Evolution
- **DataExtractionAgent** provides superior functionality compared to the planned JsonExtractionAgent:
  - LLM-assisted extraction with retry logic
  - Framework-aware JSON transformation
  - Individual file processing with graceful degradation
  
- **CalculationAgent** handles mathematical operations originally planned for StatisticalAnalysisAgent:
  - Deterministic calculations from framework specifications
  - Framework-agnostic numeric field processing
  - Secure code execution with proper error handling

### Architecture Assessment
The current production agents represent an **evolved and improved architecture** rather than missing functionality. The registry documentation simply hadn't been updated to reflect the working reality.

## Files Modified
- `discernus/core/agent_registry.yaml` - Updated to reflect actual agent implementations

## Impact
- Registry documentation now accurately matches working codebase
- Eliminates confusion from references to non-existent agents
- Provides clear documentation of actual production pipeline capabilities

## GitHub Issue
Created issue #133 to track this work: https://github.com/discernus/discernus/issues/133
