# The Attesor Study: Strategic Overview & Methodological Framework
**Date**: January 12, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Validation Testing  
**Project**: Cross-Linguistic Bias Mitigation in Computational Political Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

The **Attesor Study** addresses systematic speaker identity bias observed in Large Language Model (LLM) political analysis. Initial bias testing revealed consistent scoring variations based on speaker identification, prompting development of cross-linguistic methodology to eliminate identity-based analytical contamination.

**Findings**: LLMs exhibit systematic identity-driven bias even with minimal speaker identification cues. This study develops and tests Esperanto translation as a potential bias mitigation approach.

## Initial Findings: Speaker Identity Bias Effects

### Observed Phenomena
Systematic testing of the PDAF (Political Discourse Analysis Framework) revealed consistent scoring variations based on speaker identity knowledge. Identical political content received different analytical scores when speaker information was available versus anonymized conditions.

**Case Example**: Constitutional language analysis showed:
- **Anonymous condition**: Authenticity score of 1.7
- **Identity-aware condition**: Authenticity score of 0.3
- **Variance**: 1.4-point difference on 2.0 scale (70% variation)

### Scope Assessment
Preliminary testing indicates this bias pattern occurs across:
- Multiple LLM architectures (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- Different analytical frameworks beyond PDAF
- Various content types (speeches, documents, social media)
- Minimal identity triggers (including filename-based identification)

### Research Implications
These findings suggest potential systematic bias in existing LLM-based political research, indicating need for methodological examination and possible bias mitigation strategies.

## Methodological Response: Attesor Study Framework

### Theoretical Approach
The study employs cross-linguistic methodology to test bias mitigation through translation. The hypothesis posits that Esperanto translation may eliminate LLM associations with English political discourse while maintaining analytical validity.

### Research Design
**Two-Phase Structure**:
1. **Bias Quantification**: Systematic measurement of identity bias effects across models and frameworks
2. **Mitigation Testing**: Cross-linguistic bias elimination effectiveness assessment

### Implementation Architecture
**Identity Protection Protocol**:
- **Hash-based file identification**: Cryptographic speaker identity protection
- **Content sanitization**: Systematic removal of identifying markers
- **Cross-linguistic translation**: Esperanto versions for bias comparison
- **Secure corpus management**: Controlled access to identity mapping

---

## Preliminary Findings: Methodological Observations

### 1. Identity Trigger Sensitivity
Minimal identity cues (including filename-based speaker identification) produce systematic analytical bias. Complete identity elimination appears necessary beyond content sanitization alone.

### 2. Framework Generalizability
Identity bias effects observed across multiple analytical frameworks, suggesting general rather than framework-specific phenomenon.

### 3. Confidence Metric Limitations
LLMs maintain high confidence scores while producing contradictory analyses based on identity knowledge, limiting confidence as bias detection mechanism.

### 4. Training Data Associations
LLMs appear to have established associative networks linking speaker identities to analytical expectations, suggesting technical rather than prompt-based mitigation approaches may be required.

### 5. Cross-Linguistic Potential
Esperanto's limited political discourse representation in LLM training data, combined with maintained expressive capacity, suggests potential for bias mitigation while preserving analytical validity.

### 6. Framework-Level Bias Contamination
Systematic review of PDAF v1.0 revealed embedded bias triggers including politician names, partisan language, and ideological markers that could independently contaminate analysis regardless of corpus sanitization. Framework sanitization (PDAF v1.1) represents critical methodological advancement beyond content-level bias mitigation.

### 7. Framework Optimization and Context Window Efficiency
Integration of calibration packet concepts into inline framework architecture achieved 85% context window reduction (212.5KB → 36KB, 3,440 lines → 505 lines) while enhancing analytical precision through comprehensive disambiguation features. This optimization eliminates external dependencies, reduces computational costs, and improves deployment reliability for large-scale multi-LLM analysis.

### 8. Scale Polarity Correction and Methodological Defensibility Enhancement
Systematic review revealed scale inversion in economic measurement creating systematic ideological bias where left-wing and right-wing populist discourse of equivalent intensity received different scores. Resolution through 10-anchor dual-track architecture separates populist intensity measurement from economic direction classification, eliminating bias while preserving descriptive richness. Additionally, removed weighted composite formulas from primary analysis, implementing transparent unweighted raw score collection with comprehensive post-hoc analysis guidance to ensure maximum methodological defensibility.
