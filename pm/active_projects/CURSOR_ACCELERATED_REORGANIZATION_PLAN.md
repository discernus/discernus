## Development Phases & Sequencing

### **Week 1 (Aug 3-10): Foundation Sprint**
```
Day 1 (0.5 Cursor Days): Complete Sprint 6 provenance fixes
- Morning: Fix field name mismatch (#293)
- Afternoon: Fix CSV export silent failure (#294)  
- Evening: Add artifact metadata & validation (#295, #296)

Result: Provenance chain fully functional
```

### **Week 2-3 (Aug 11-24): Evidence Architecture**
```
Days 2-3 (1.5 Cursor Days): Evidence architecture & provenance UX
- Epic #280 integration work
- Human-readable artifact names (#297)
- Enhanced Git integration (#298)
- Provenance dashboard (#299)

Result: Transparent, user-friendly provenance system
```

### **Week 4 (Aug 25-31): Academic Quality**
```
Day 4 (1 Cursor Day): Final report quality transformation
- Dual-purpose report structure (#300)
- Defensive prompting (#301)
- Methodology transparency (#302)
- Integration testing with existing experiments

Result: Academic collaboration-ready reports
```

### **Final Week (Sep 1-5): Framework Migration & Polish**
```
Day 5 (1 Cursor Day): Framework v7.1 migration
- Framework specification update (#286)
- Reference framework migration (#287-290)
- Comprehensive testing and validation

Result: Complete platform ready for academic collaboration
```

## Quality Gates & Success Metrics

### **Alpha Foundation Success Criteria**
- [ ] `statistical_results.csv` properly populated in all test runs
- [ ] Provenance chain instantly traversable from final report to raw artifacts
- [ ] No silent failures in CSV export pipeline
- [ ] All artifact hashes properly validated and logged

### **Alpha Comprehensive Success Criteria**
- [ ] External academic reviewer can understand methodology without expert knowledge
- [ ] Complete replication package automatically generated
- [ ] Final reports meet academic collaboration standard from personas document
- [ ] All frameworks migrated to v7.1 specification
- [ ] Provenance system human-friendly and transparent

## Resource Allocation Strategy

### **Cursor Optimization Approach**
1. **Parallel Development**: Use Cursor's multi-file editing for coordinated changes
2. **Rapid Iteration**: Leverage instant feedback loops for quality improvement
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Use acceleration for thorough validation, not just speed
4. **Documentation Integration**: Build documentation as part of development, not after

### **Budget Utilization**
- **Maximum Mode Usage**: For complex architectural changes and multi-component integration
- **Quality Focus**: Use acceleration for thoroughness, not just delivery speed  
- **Testing Investment**: Comprehensive validation of all improvements
- **Academic Standard**: Time for proper peer-review readiness, not "good enough"

## Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks**
- **Framework Migration Complexity**: Staggered approach with validation at each step
- **Integration Challenges**: Epic #280 work may require coordination with other components
- **Academic Quality Standards**: Use personas document as quality gate

### **Timeline Risks**
- **Scope Creep**: Strict focus on academic collaboration readiness
- **Quality vs. Speed**: Cursor acceleration allows both - no compromise needed
- **External Dependencies**: Minimal - mostly internal architectural improvements

## Success Indicators

### **Immediate (Aug 14)**
- Provenance chain crisis resolved
- Statistical results properly exported
- Development velocity unblocked

### **Comprehensive (Sep 1)**
- Academic reviewers can evaluate methodology
- Complete replication packages generated
- Final reports meet collaboration standard
- Platform ready for academic partnerships

## Strategic Benefits

### **Academic Credibility**
- Methodology transparency enables proper evaluation
- Complete provenance chain supports replication
- Professional report structure facilitates collaboration

### **Development Velocity**
- No technical debt from rushing
- Comprehensive testing prevents regression
- Quality-first approach reduces future maintenance

### **Competitive Position**
- Academic gold standard differentiates from other platforms
- Peer-review readiness enables academic adoption
- Complete transparency builds trust and credibility
