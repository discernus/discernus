# DataIntegrityAnalyst Implementation Handoff

**Date:** July 18, 2025  
**Session:** MVA Experiment 3 Analysis Session  
**Status:** ðŸ”„ HANDOFF TO NEXT AGENT  
**Priority:** High - Critical for research integrity

## Session Summary

### What Was Accomplished âœ…

1. **Root Cause Identified & Fixed** - Synthesis agent data contamination issue
   - Problem: LLM was simulating data instead of using real experimental results
   - Solution: Fixed data extraction in `discernus/agents/synthesis_agent.py` 
   - Status: âœ… Committed to dev branch (7e52623e)

2. **Issue Documentation** - Comprehensive analysis and resolution documentation
   - File: `pm/active_projects/SYNTHESIS_AGENT_DATA_CONTAMINATION_FIX.md`
   - Status: âœ… Committed to dev branch (1e07943f)

3. **Architectural Design** - DataIntegrityAnalyst agent specification
   - File: `docs/DATA_INTEGRITY_ANALYST_DESIGN.md`
   - Status: âœ… Committed to dev branch (1e07943f)

### Key Technical Insights

- **LLM "Helpfulness" Problem:** LLMs will fill data gaps even with explicit instructions not to
- **Data Completeness Critical:** Partial data samples inevitably lead to contamination
- **System-Level Solutions:** Fix data handling architecture rather than relying on prompt engineering
- **THIN Architecture Alignment:** Specialized agents with single responsibilities prevent complexity

## Outstanding Work Items

### 1. DataIntegrityAnalyst Implementation ðŸŸ¡ NEXT AGENT
**Status:** Design approved, ready for implementation  
**Files:** See design document at `docs/DATA_INTEGRITY_ANALYST_DESIGN.md`

**Phase 1 Requirements:**
- [ ] Create `discernus/agents/data_integrity_analyst.py`
- [ ] Implement core data quality validation (completeness, consistency, ranges)
- [ ] Add to workflow orchestration between CalculationAgent and SynthesisAgent
- [ ] Test with MVA Experiment 3 data to validate functionality

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- Must be framework-agnostic (works with any experimental data structure)
- Should follow THIN architecture (LLM intelligence + thin software routing)
- Needs to integrate with existing workflow state management
- Should produce detailed quality reports for provenance

### 2. Workflow Integration Updates ðŸŸ¡ NEXT AGENT
**Status:** Architecture designed, needs implementation

**Required Changes:**
- [ ] Update `WorkflowOrchestrator` to include DataIntegrityAnalyst step
- [ ] Modify workflow state to include data quality results
- [ ] Update CLI to handle new workflow step
- [ ] Add data integrity step to experiment definitions

### 3. Testing & Validation ðŸŸ¡ NEXT AGENT
**Status:** Test cases identified, needs implementation

**Test Requirements:**
- [ ] Test with MVA Experiment 3 dataset (46 successful runs, 1 failed)
- [ ] Test with incomplete/corrupted data to validate error handling
- [ ] Test with different framework types (CFF, PDAF, etc.)
- [ ] Validate statistical results match manual analysis benchmarks

## Key Files & References

### Documentation
- `pm/active_projects/SYNTHESIS_AGENT_DATA_CONTAMINATION_FIX.md` - Problem analysis & resolution
- `docs/DATA_INTEGRITY_ANALYST_DESIGN.md` - Complete architectural specification
- `docs/AGENT_BRIEFING.md` - Core THIN architecture principles

### Code References  
- `discernus/agents/synthesis_agent.py` - Recently fixed (data extraction method)
- `discernus/orchestration/workflow_orchestrator.py` - Needs DataIntegrityAnalyst integration
- `discernus/agents/` - Directory for new agent implementation

### Test Data
- `projects/MVA/experiments/experiment_3/results/2025-07-18_09-05-44/` - Original experimental data
- `projects/MVA/experiments/experiment_3/results/2025-07-18_16-50-03/` - Results from fixed synthesis agent
- `projects/MVA/experiments/experiment_3/results/2025-07-18_09-05-44/SHOULD_HAVE_BEEN_GENERATED_REPORT.md` - Gold standard manual analysis

## Current System State

### Working Components âœ…
- AnalysisAgent: Generating CFF scores successfully
- DataExtractionAgent: Extracting structured data properly  
- CalculationAgent: Computing cohesion indices correctly
- SynthesisAgent: **FIXED** - Now uses real data instead of simulating

### Integration Points ðŸ”„
- Workflow orchestration ready for new agent insertion
- State management supports additional agent results
- LLM gateway configured for all agent types
- CLI supports workflow resumption and step insertion

### Known Issues ðŸš¨
- **Data Quality Gap:** No systematic validation before synthesis (what DataIntegrityAnalyst will solve)
- **Error Propagation:** Failed runs can create downstream statistical issues
- **Quality Visibility:** No explicit reporting of data quality metrics

## Success Criteria for Next Agent

### Minimum Viable Implementation
- [ ] DataIntegrityAnalyst creates clean datasets for SynthesisAgent
- [ ] Basic quality validation (completeness, range checking, duplicates)
- [ ] Integration with existing workflow without breaking changes
- [ ] Quality report generation for provenance

### Validation Metrics
- [ ] MVA Experiment 3 data processed without quality issues
- [ ] SynthesisAgent statistical results remain accurate with cleansed data
- [ ] Clear quality metrics and cleansing actions reported
- [ ] No regression in existing workflow functionality

### Research Integrity Goals
- [ ] Prevent contaminated data from reaching statistical analysis
- [ ] Provide audit trail for all data quality decisions
- [ ] Flag potential issues for human review when appropriate
- [ ] Maintain framework-agnostic operation across different experimental types

## Technical Context

### Architecture Constraints
- **THIN Principle:** LLM provides intelligence, software provides infrastructure
- **Framework Agnostic:** Must work with CFF, PDAF, and future frameworks
- **State Management:** Must integrate with existing workflow state structure
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation when data quality is poor

### Performance Considerations
- Data quality analysis should add minimal latency to workflow
- Quality reports should be human-readable and actionable
- Cleansing operations should preserve experimental validity
- LLM calls should be efficient (avoid redundant analysis)

**Handoff Date:** July 18, 2025  
**Next Agent Instructions:** Begin with Phase 1 implementation of DataIntegrityAnalyst per design specification  
**Escalation:** If architectural questions arise, refer to THIN principles and framework-agnostic design requirements
