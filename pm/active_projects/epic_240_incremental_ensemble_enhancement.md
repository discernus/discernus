# Epic #240: Incremental Ensemble Enhancement
*Pragmatic reliability improvements through progressive ensemble optimization*

**Milestone**: Alpha Comprehensive (Academic Gold Standard)  
**Timeline**: September 1, 2025  
**Estimated Effort**: ~0.6 Cursor days (4 weeks traditional development)

## Executive Summary

This epic implements focused reliability improvements by progressively enhancing ensemble capabilities within the existing THIN v2.0 architecture. Rather than comprehensive research, this approach builds incrementally on the proven Gemini-first foundation to deliver immediate value through self-consistency ensembles, temperature optimization, and strategic model validation.

**Core Philosophy**: Build on proven infrastructure rather than replacing it. Deliver measurable improvements at each phase with minimal architectural complexity.

## Strategic Context

### Current State Analysis
- **Proven Baseline**: Gemini 2.5 Flash/Pro pipeline with $0.39 cost and 87%/84% confidence scores
- **Existing Infrastructure**: `ensemble_runs` parameter exists but disabled (set to 1)  
- **THIN v2.0 Foundation**: Direct function call orchestration ready for ensemble enhancement
- **DSQ Advantage**: Dynamic Shared Quota provides cost-effective scaling for ensemble methods

### Business Justification
- **Immediate ROI**: 40-60% variance reduction with 3x cost increase (acceptable for academic research)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Incremental changes preserve existing functionality
- **User Value**: Higher reliability without workflow disruption
- **Competitive Advantage**: Systematic ensemble optimization differentiates from ad-hoc approaches

## Epic Structure and Issues

### Issue #241: Enable Self-Consistency Ensemble
**Priority**: High  
**Epic**: #240  
**Phase**: Foundation Enhancement  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 week

**Description**: Activate existing ensemble infrastructure with median aggregation for immediate reliability improvements.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uncomment/enhance `ensemble_runs` logic in `ThinOrchestrator.run_experiment()`
- Implement median aggregation for synthesis results
- Add ensemble metadata tracking for provenance
- Integrate with existing audit logging system

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Working `--ensemble-runs 3` CLI parameter
- [ ] Median aggregation implementation for LLM responses  
- [ ] Comparative testing framework (single vs ensemble runs)
- [ ] Performance metrics collection and reporting

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- `discernus run --ensemble-runs 3` executes successfully
- Median aggregation reduces response variance by 40-60%
- No breaking changes to existing single-run functionality
- Provenance system captures ensemble metadata correctly

**Validation Approach**:
- Run same experiment with `ensemble_runs=1` vs `ensemble_runs=3`  
- Measure variance reduction across framework dimensions
- Document cost vs quality improvement metrics
- Validate on 2-3 existing experiments for baseline comparison

### Issue #243: Strategic Model Validation Pipeline
**Priority**: Low  
**Epic**: #240  
**Phase**: Quality Validation  
**Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks

**Description**: Add Claude 4 Sonnet as strategic validation model for quality assurance without major cost increases.

**Technical Implementation**:
