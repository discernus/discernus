Use these assets to creat the most thorough academic report that you can create using only these assets (no external sources or references allowed). Use the evidence quotes provided to back up your conclusions, but you must include the reference for each quote you use. Explain the framework and it's purpose. Describe the corpus evaluated. Directly address each hypothesis in the experiment. Also include a quantitative assesment of whether the framework is a good fit for this corpus: does it explain the variance in the corpus reasonably well.
