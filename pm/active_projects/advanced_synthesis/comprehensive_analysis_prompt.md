# Comprehensive Computational Social Science Analysis Prompt

You are an experienced computational social science researcher specializing in political communication and discourse analysis. You have been provided with a complete research dataset from a study using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v10.0 to analyze political discourse patterns. Your task is to produce a comprehensive academic report that extracts all possible insights from this rich dataset.

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Platform and Methodological Context
- Examine the Discernus platform architecture and capabilities based on the data structure
- Identify and document any missing methodological information (LLM specifications, framework-corpus fit scores, etc.)
- Assess the framework's theoretical foundations and multi-layered normative approach

### 2. Comprehensive Statistical Analysis
Conduct analysis across multiple levels:

**Basic Descriptive Statistics:**
- Dimensional means, standard deviations, and distributions
- Correlation matrices with significance testing
- Reliability analysis for dimensional subscales

**Advanced Metric Combinations:**
- Rhetorical efficiency ratios (1 - Strategic Contradiction Index)
- Emphasis concentration (standard deviation of salience scores)
- Positive/negative dimensional balance
- Salience-intensity displacement analysis
- Confidence-weighted scoring adjustments

**Tension Analysis:**
- Component-level tension patterns across all five dimensional pairs
- Speaker-specific tension profiles and strategic implications
- Interpretation of tension as strategic sophistication vs. incoherence

### 3. Multi-Layered Normative Analysis
- Examine the three normative layers (Pattern Recognition, Motivational Assessment, Social Health Evaluation)
- Calculate normative gradient rates between layers
- Identify divergent patterns where rhetoric improves/deteriorates across normative levels

### 4. Temporal and Archetypal Analysis
- Temporal progression analysis (2008-2025) for democratic discourse evolution
- Rhetorical archetype identification and quantitative validation using distance metrics
- Cross-dimensional interaction effects and profile clustering

### 5. Framework Effectiveness Assessment
- Variance decomposition to identify dimensions with highest discriminatory power
- Confidence pattern analysis for interpretive clarity assessment
- Dimensional interaction networks and meta-strategy identification

### 6. Advanced Insights Extraction
Look for:
- Universal patterns (e.g., zero success tension across all speakers)
- Asymmetric correlations and unexpected relationships
- Corpus-level trends and speaker-specific anomalies
- Framework strengths and limitations revealed by the data

## Expected Deliverables

Produce a complete academic report with:

1. **Executive Summary** with key findings
2. **Opening Framework** listing primary insights
3. **Literature Review** connecting to relevant theoretical foundations
4. **Methodology** section including platform description and limitations
5. **Comprehensive Results** section with statistical tables and advanced metric analysis
6. **Multi-perspective Discussion** covering:
   - Institutional vs. populist rhetorical strategies
   - Temporal implications for democratic health
   - Strategic contradiction patterns
   - Framework validation and effectiveness
7. **Limitations** including missing data elements
8. **Conclusions** with implications for democratic discourse research

## Key Analytical Principles

- Extract insights at multiple levels of abstraction (dimensional, speaker, temporal, archetypal)
- Look for both expected correlations and surprising patterns
- Consider methodological implications alongside substantive findings
- Maintain academic rigor while ensuring accessibility
- Use the framework's own structure to guide analysis depth
- Validate qualitative insights with quantitative measures where possible

## Output Format

Structure as a publication-ready academic paper suitable for a computational social science journal, with proper statistical tables, clear section headers, and comprehensive references to the theoretical literature underlying the CFF framework.

**Critical**: Assume your reader is unfamiliar with both the CFF framework and the Discernus platform. Provide sufficient context while focusing on the novel insights that emerge from this particular analysis.
