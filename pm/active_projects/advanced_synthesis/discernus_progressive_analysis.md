## Critical Design Constraints

### Mathematical Operation Restrictions
**Provenance and Replication Requirements**: To maintain unassailable scientific standards, synthesis agents are restricted to interpretive analysis only. Any new mathematical operations must:

1. **Be Proposed as Validated Code**: Agents identify need for new calculations and generate code specifications
2. **Execute in Tracked Environment**: Discernus validates and executes all mathematical operations with full provenance
3. **Maintain Replication Chain**: All statistical computations are logged and reproducible
4. **Flow Back to Synthesis**: Results integrate back into interpretive pipeline

**Agent Capabilities**:
- ✅ **Permitted**: Pattern recognition, relationship interpretation, categorical classification, comparative analysis, insight synthesis
- ❌ **Prohibited**: Statistical calculations, mathematical transformations, weighted averaging, distance computations

**When New Math is Required**:
- Agent identifies analytical need and proposes calculation methodology
- Discernus validates code and executes in controlled environment  
- Results feed back to synthesis agents for interpretation
- Full audit trail maintained for scientific replication

### Analytical Efficiency
- **Parallel Foundation Processing**: Stage 1 agents run simultaneously to maximize throughput
- **Sequential Synthesis**: Stages 2-3 build incrementally to avoid redundant computation
- **Cached Computation**: Statistical operations shared across agents to minimize processing time
- **Progressive Refinement**: Each stage adds analytical depth without repeating previous work

### Insight Maximization
- **Systematic Coverage**: Every analytical dimension explicitly addressed by specialized agents
- **Cross-Validation**: Multiple agents validate key findings through different approaches
- **Novelty Detection**: Systematic exploration of unexpected patterns and edge cases
- **Framework Optimization**: Full utilization of framework-specific analytical opportunities

### Quality Assurance
- **Multi-Agent Validation**: Critical insights confirmed by multiple analytical approaches
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Confidence levels and limitations explicitly tracked
- **Methodological Transparency**: All analytical decisions and limitations documented
- **Reproducibility Focus**: Clear documentation for replication and validation
