# Milestone Consolidation Strategy
*Simplifying fragmented milestone structure for Cursor-accelerated development*

## Current State Analysis

### **Existing Milestones** *(8 active, 88 open issues)*
```
Alpha v1.0: Gasket Architecture (25 issues)
Alpha v1.1: Performance & UX (21 issues) 
Alpha v1.2: Integration & Testing (6 issues)
Alpha v1.3: Academic Foundation & Release Readiness (10 issues)
Framework Specification v7.1 Migration (5 issues)
Research & Future Work (10 issues)
Alpha Foundation (Immediate) (4 issues) [NEW]
Alpha Comprehensive (Academic Gold Standard) (7 issues) [NEW]
```

### **Problems with Current Structure**
1. **Fragmentation**: 8 milestones create coordination overhead
2. **Artificial Deadlines**: v1.0, v1.1, v1.2 structure assumes traditional development pace
3. **Blocking Dependencies**: Issues scattered across milestones with unclear sequencing
4. **Mixed Priorities**: Critical fixes mixed with future research work

## Consolidation Strategy

### **New Simplified Structure** *(2 active milestones)*

#### **Alpha Foundation (Immediate)** - *4 issues*
**Purpose**: Critical fixes to unblock development  
**Timeline**: ~0.5 Cursor days (August 14)
- Provenance connection fixes (#293-296)
- Essential stability work from old milestones

#### **Alpha Comprehensive (Academic Gold Standard)** - *7+ issues*  
**Purpose**: Academic collaboration readiness
**Timeline**: ~3.5 Cursor days (September 1)
- Evidence architecture and provenance UX
- Final report quality improvements
- Framework v7.1 migration
- Selected high-value items from old milestones

#### **Research & Future Work** - *10 issues* *(UNCHANGED)*
**Purpose**: Post-alpha research and exploration
**Timeline**: Post-September 1
- Keep existing research milestone for future work

### **Migration Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Issue Triage** *(Immediate)*
For each old milestone, categorize issues:

**Alpha v1.0: Gasket Architecture (25 issues)**
- **Critical**: Move to Alpha Foundation (gasket blockers)
- **Important**: Move to Alpha Comprehensive (gasket enhancements)  
- **Future**: Move to Research & Future Work or close

**Alpha v1.1: Performance & UX (21 issues)**
- **Critical**: Move to Alpha Foundation (UX blockers)
- **Important**: Move to Alpha Comprehensive (academic UX)
- **Future**: Defer to post-alpha or close

**Alpha v1.2: Integration & Testing (6 issues)**
- **Critical**: Move to Alpha Foundation (integration blockers)
- **Important**: Move to Alpha Comprehensive (testing infrastructure)
- **Future**: Defer or close

**Alpha v1.3: Academic Foundation & Release Readiness (10 issues)**
- **All Issues**: Move to Alpha Comprehensive (perfect fit)

**Framework Specification v7.1 Migration (5 issues)**
- **All Issues**: Already moved to Alpha Comprehensive

#### **Phase 2: Milestone Deprecation**
1. **Close Old Milestones**: v1.0, v1.1, v1.2, v1.3, Framework v7.1
2. **Update Issue References**: Ensure no broken links
3. **Archive Documentation**: Preserve old milestone rationale for reference

## Issue Prioritization Matrix

### **Alpha Foundation (Immediate) Criteria**
- **Blocks Development**: Issue prevents other work from proceeding
- **Data Integrity**: Issue affects research validity (e.g., empty CSV files)
- **System Stability**: Issue causes crashes or silent failures
- **Quick Win**: Issue can be resolved in < 4 hours

### **Alpha Comprehensive Criteria**  
- **Academic Quality**: Issue improves peer review readiness
- **User Experience**: Issue improves researcher workflow
- **Transparency**: Issue improves provenance or methodology clarity
- **Collaboration**: Issue enables external academic partnerships

### **Research & Future Work Criteria**
- **Experimental**: Issue explores new capabilities
- **Performance**: Issue optimizes existing functionality
- **Advanced Features**: Issue adds sophisticated capabilities
- **Post-Alpha**: Issue can wait until after initial release

## Execution Timeline

### **Week 1: Issue Migration** *(Manual Triage)*
- **Day 1**: Triage Alpha v1.0 issues (25 issues)
- **Day 2**: Triage Alpha v1.1 issues (21 issues)  
- **Day 3**: Triage Alpha v1.2 & v1.3 issues (16 issues)
- **Day 4**: Close old milestones and update references

### **Week 2: Development Focus**
- **Alpha Foundation**: Execute critical fixes
- **Alpha Comprehensive**: Begin evidence architecture work

## Success Metrics

### **Consolidation Success**
- [ ] Reduced from 8 to 3 active milestones
- [ ] All issues properly categorized and migrated
- [ ] Clear development sequence established
- [ ] No blocking dependencies between milestones

### **Development Velocity**
- [ ] Alpha Foundation completed in 0.5 Cursor days
- [ ] Alpha Comprehensive progress measurable daily
- [ ] No coordination overhead from milestone fragmentation
- [ ] Clear priority focus for each development phase

## Risk Mitigation

### **Issue Loss Risk**
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive triage with explicit accept/defer decisions
- **Tracking**: Document all migration decisions for audit trail

### **Priority Confusion Risk**  
- **Mitigation**: Clear criteria for each milestone category
- **Validation**: Review migration decisions with stakeholder

### **Scope Creep Risk**
- **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to academic collaboration focus
- **Control**: Regular milestone scope review and adjustment

**Next Steps**:
1. Execute issue triage for old milestones
2. Migrate high-priority issues to new milestone structure  
3. Close deprecated milestones
4. Begin Alpha Foundation development sprint
