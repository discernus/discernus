# Active Projects Status Summary

**Date**: January 31, 2025  
**Status**: Cleaned, aligned with Gasket Architecture, consolidated, implementation status updated, and prototype deprecated

## Overview

The `pm/active_projects/` directory has been cleaned, reorganized, and consolidated to align with the new Discernus Gasket Architecture. Documents that were superseded by our new architectural approach have been moved to the `deprecated/` directory, while remaining documents have been updated to acknowledge the new architecture. Mathematical framework documents have been consolidated into a single comprehensive guide. Implementation status has been updated to reflect what's already built in the system. The standalone prototype has been deprecated and archived.

## Prototype Deprecation (January 31, 2025)

### Deprecated: `prototypes/thin_synthesis_architecture/`
- **Action**: Moved to `pm/active_projects/deprecated/prototype_thin_synthesis_architecture/`
- **Reason**: Superseded by production system in `discernus/agents/thin_synthesis/`
- **Architectural Difference**: Prototype used code generation approach, production uses MathToolkit approach
- **Status**: Not integrated with main Discernus infrastructure, not used by production code
- **Preservation**: Archived for historical reference and architectural evolution documentation

### Impact:
- **Clean Development Environment**: Removed confusion between prototype and production components
- **Clear Architecture**: Production system now clearly represents the current architectural approach
- **Historical Record**: Prototype preserved for research and documentation purposes

## Implementation Status Summary

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented and Operational
- **MathToolkit** (`discernus/core/math_toolkit.py`) - Comprehensive mathematical functions
- **THIN Synthesis Pipeline** (`discernus/agents/thin_synthesis/`) - Complete 4-agent architecture
- **Evidence Curator** - Fan-out/fan-in pattern with evidence selection
- **Results Interpreter** - Narrative synthesis and report generation
- **Replication Package** - Provenance tracking and artifact management
- **Validation Agent** (`discernus/agents/experiment_coherence_agent.py`) - Gasket #1

### üîÑ Partially Implemented (Needs Updates)
- **ThinOrchestrator** - Needs gasket integration
- **Framework Validation** - Needs v7.0 schema support

### ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented
- **Intelligent Extractor Gasket** - Critical gap (Gasket #2)
- **CSV Export Agent** - Mid-point data export (Gasket #3a)
- **Framework Specification v7.0** - New specification with gasket schema

## Archived Documents (Moved to deprecated/)

The following documents were moved to `pm/active_projects/deprecated/` because they were superseded by the new gasket architecture or consolidated:

### Superseded by Gasket Architecture:
1. **`CSV_TO_JSON_MIGRATION_STRATEGIC_ANALYSIS.md`** - Superseded by Raw Analysis Log approach
2. **`THIN_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`** - Outdated analysis before gasket architecture
3. **`THIN_Code_Generated_Synthesis_Architecture.md`** - Superseded by parallel stream approach
4. **`academic_ensemble_strategy.md`** - Superseded by simplified gasket approach
5. **`epic_218_academic_ensemble_architecture.md`** - Superseded by gasket architecture
6. **`LLM_MODEL_SELECTION_RESEARCH_PLAN.md`** - Superseded by focused gasket model selection

### Consolidated into Mathematical Framework Guide:
7. **`discernus_declarative_mathematical_specification_model.md`** - Consolidated into comprehensive guide
8. **`QUANTQA_AGENT_MATHEMATICAL_VERIFICATION_PLAN.md`** - Consolidated into comprehensive guide
9. **`llm_math_framework_guide.md`** - Consolidated into comprehensive guide

### Deprecated Prototype:
10. **`prototype_thin_synthesis_architecture/`** - Standalone prototype superseded by production system

## Document Consolidation Benefits

### Before Consolidation:
- 9 active documents
- 3 separate mathematical framework documents with overlapping content
- 1 standalone prototype creating confusion
- Potential for conflicting guidance and maintenance overhead

### After Consolidation:
- 7 active documents
- 1 comprehensive mathematical framework guide
- 1 deprecated prototype (archived)
- Single source of truth for mathematical operations
- Reduced redundancy and improved organization

## Architectural Alignment

All remaining active documents now align with the Gasket Architecture principles:

- **THIN Design**: Clear separation between LLM intelligence and deterministic operations
- **Framework Agnostic**: Support for any framework that provides a `gasket_schema`
- **Parallel Streams**: Quantitative (scores) and qualitative (evidence) processing paths
- **Raw Analysis Log**: Single source of truth for both streams
- **Three Gaskets**: Human-to-Pipeline, LLM-to-Math, and Pipeline-to-Human interfaces
- **Mathematical Verification**: QuantQA integration ensures reliability at critical stages

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Framework Specification v7.0** (Phase 1 of roadmap)
2. **Build Intelligent Extractor Gasket** (Phase 2 of roadmap) - Critical gap
3. **Update existing frameworks** to include `gasket_schema` sections
4. **Test and validate** the new architecture with existing experiments
5. **Reference the comprehensive mathematical guide** for all mathematical framework decisions
6. **Leverage existing MathToolkit and THIN synthesis pipeline** for faster implementation

The active_projects directory is now clean, focused, consolidated, and accurately reflects the current implementation status. The roadmap shows that significant components are already built, reducing the implementation effort and risk. The prototype has been properly deprecated and archived to maintain a clean development environment.
