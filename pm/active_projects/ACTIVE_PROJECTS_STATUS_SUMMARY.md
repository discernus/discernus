# Active Projects Status Summary

**Date**: January 28, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ CURRENT - Reflects latest architectural decisions and plans

---

This document provides a high-level summary of the active projects and canonical architectural documents for the Discernus platform. Its purpose is to serve as a stable entry point for understanding our current technical direction.

## üèõÔ∏è **Canonical Architecture Document**

-   **Document**: `SYNTHESIS_SCALABILITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`
-   **Purpose**: This is the **single source of truth** for our entire synthesis architecture, scalability strategy, and implementation plan.
-   **Contains**:
    -   Strategic context and architectural philosophy.
    -   Root cause analysis of the synthesis bottlenecks (output tokens, mathematical reliability).
    -   The Embedded CSV architecture decision and technical specification.
    -   Post-CSV scalability projections (3,000-8,000+ document synthesis).
    -   A complete, phased implementation and prototyping plan.
    -   Risk mitigation strategies and governance checkpoints.

## üöÄ **Current Active Project**

-   **Project**: **Embedded CSV Architecture - Phase 1 Isolated Proof of Concept**
-   **Objective**: Validate the core mechanics of the new architecture in an isolated environment.
-   **Details**: See Section 4 of `SYNTHESIS_SCALABILITY_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the detailed plan.
-   **Status**: üìã **READY TO START**

## deprecated **Historical & Deprecated Documents**

-   **Directory**: `deprecated_20250128/`
-   **Purpose**: This directory archives the research, analysis, and prior plans that led to the current architectural decision. It is preserved for historical context and provenance but should not be used for current planning.
-   **Includes**:
    -   `LLM_LIMITS_RESEARCH_HANDOFF.md`
    -   `LLAMA_SCOUT_VS_GEMINI_COMPARISON.md`
    -   `SYNTHESIS_VERBOSITY_ANALYSIS.md`
    -   And other superseded synthesis-related planning documents.
