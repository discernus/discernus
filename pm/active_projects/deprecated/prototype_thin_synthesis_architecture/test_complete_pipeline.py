Complete Pipeline Test

This is the ultimate validation of the THIN Code-Generated Synthesis Architecture.
Tests the complete 4-agent pipeline end-to-end with real data.

This test validates the breakthrough synthesis approach that solves the 
fundamental scalability limitations of monolithic LLM synthesis.

## Overview
This framework assesses civic character through virtue and vice dimensions in political discourse.
It represents a comprehensive analytical approach to evaluating political rhetoric.

## Analytical Dimensions

### Virtues (Expected to be positively correlated)
- **Integrity**: Consistency between stated values and actions, honesty in communication
- **Courage**: Willingness to take principled stands despite opposition or political cost
- **Compassion**: Demonstrated concern for others' wellbeing, empathy in policy positions
- **Justice**: Commitment to fairness, equal treatment, and procedural fairness
- **Wisdom**: Sound judgment, long-term thinking, evidence-based decision making

### Vices (Expected to be positively correlated, negatively correlated with virtues)
- **Corruption**: Self-serving behavior at public expense, conflicts of interest
- **Cowardice**: Avoiding difficult decisions, failure to take principled stands
- **Cruelty**: Callousness toward others' suffering, harmful policy positions
- **Injustice**: Unfair treatment, discrimination, procedural violations
- **Folly**: Poor judgment, short-sighted thinking, ignoring evidence

## Research Hypotheses

### H1: Virtue Cluster Coherence
Virtue dimensions (integrity, courage, compassion, justice, wisdom) will demonstrate positive inter-correlations, forming a coherent construct.

### H2: Vice Cluster Coherence  
Vice dimensions (corruption, cowardice, cruelty, injustice, folly) will demonstrate positive inter-correlations, forming a coherent construct.

### H3: Virtue-Vice Opposition
Virtue and vice dimensions will demonstrate negative correlations, indicating they represent opposing character traits.

### H4: Overall Civic Character
The overall virtue score will significantly exceed the overall vice score across the corpus, indicating net positive civic character.

## Statistical Requirements

### Reliability Assessment
- Calculate Cronbach's alpha for virtue cluster (expected Œ± ‚â• 0.70)
- Calculate Cronbach's alpha for vice cluster (expected Œ± ‚â• 0.70)
- Report reliability assessment and implications

### Correlation Analysis
- Generate correlation matrix for virtue dimensions only
- Generate correlation matrix for vice dimensions only
- Generate comprehensive correlation matrix including all dimensions
- Calculate overall virtue vs. overall vice correlation

### Hypothesis Testing
- Test H1-H4 using appropriate statistical methods
- Report p-values, effect sizes, and practical significance
- Use Œ± = 0.05 significance level

### Effect Size Analysis
- Calculate Cohen's d for significant mean differences
- Calculate Œ∑¬≤ (eta-squared) for ANOVA effects where applicable
- Interpret practical significance alongside statistical significance

## Expected Outcomes
Based on civic character theory, we expect to find:
1. Strong internal consistency within virtue and vice clusters
2. Moderate to strong negative correlations between virtue and vice dimensions
3. Overall virtue scores exceeding vice scores in democratic political discourse
4. Meaningful individual differences that can inform character assessment
