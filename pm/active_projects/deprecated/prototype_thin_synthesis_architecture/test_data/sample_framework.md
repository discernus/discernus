## Analytical Dimensions

### Virtues
- **Integrity**: Consistency between stated values and actions

- **Cowardice**: Avoiding difficult decisions or principled stands
- **Cruelty**: Callousness toward others' suffering
- **Injustice**: Unfair treatment or discrimination
- **Folly**: Poor judgment or short-sighted thinking

## Statistical Requirements

### Reliability Assessment
- Calculate Cronbach's alpha for virtue and vice clusters
- Minimum acceptable reliability: α ≥ 0.70

### Correlation Analysis
- Examine relationships within virtue cluster
- Examine relationships within vice cluster
- Test virtue-vice inverse correlation hypothesis

### Hypothesis Testing
- H1: Virtue dimensions positively correlate with each other
- H2: Vice dimensions positively correlate with each other  
- H3: Virtue and vice dimensions negatively correlate
- H4: Overall virtue score > overall vice score (civic character hypothesis)

### Effect Size Requirements
- Report Cohen's d for all significant comparisons
- Report η² (eta-squared) for ANOVA effects
- Interpret practical significance alongside statistical significance
