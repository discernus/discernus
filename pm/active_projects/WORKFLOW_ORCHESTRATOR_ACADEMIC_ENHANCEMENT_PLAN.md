# WorkflowOrchestrator Academic Enhancement Plan
**MVA Phase 2.5 Implementation Guide**

**Date**: January 16, 2025  
**Status**: Chartered  
**Context**: Post-regression recovery of academic capabilities in the WorkflowOrchestrator

---

## Executive Summary

The `WorkflowOrchestrator` successfully implements the "Show Your Work" pattern but lacks the academic rigor present in the `EnsembleOrchestrator`. This plan systematically restores publication-quality research capabilities while maintaining the clean architecture of the workflow system.

**Strategic Principle**: Enhance, don't replace. The WorkflowOrchestrator's clean design is preserved while adding sophisticated academic agents as workflow steps.
