## **🚨 OUTSTANDING CRITICAL ISSUES**

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure Overhaul (HIGH PRIORITY)**

#### **1.1 LiteLLM Proxy Migration** 
**Issue**: Currently pounding Vertex AI APIs with no rate limiting
**Impact**: Risk of hitting API limits, inefficient resource usage
**Solution**: Migrate to LiteLLM proxy for enterprise-grade traffic management

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create LiteLLM proxy configuration with Vertex AI models
- [ ] Update LLMGateway to use proxy endpoint instead of direct SDK
- [ ] Configure rate limiting rules (RPM/TPM per model, per user)
- [ ] Set up cost budgets and alerts
- [ ] Test proxy with existing experiments
- [ ] Document proxy configuration and deployment

**Expected Benefits**:
- ✅ Automatic rate limiting and queuing
- ✅ Built-in cost tracking and budgets  
- ✅ Request/response logging
- ✅ Circuit breaker patterns
- ✅ Health checks and monitoring

#### **1.2 Session Architecture Redesign**
**Issue**: Directory structure chaos, no centralized session management
**Impact**: Difficult to track experiment progress, poor provenance
**Solution**: Implement proper project/experiment/session hierarchy

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Design unified session directory structure
- [ ] Create SessionManager class for centralized session handling
- [ ] Implement session resumption capabilities
- [ ] Consolidate scattered logs into single session folder
- [ ] Update WorkflowOrchestrator to use new session structure
- [ ] Migrate existing experiments to new structure

**Expected Structure**:
```
projects/MVA/
├── PROJECT_CHRONOLOG_MVA.jsonl
└── experiments/
    └── experiment_3/
        ├── experiment_snapshot.md
        ├── framework_snapshot.md
        └── sessions/
            └── session_20250117_215915/
                ├── session_chronolog.jsonl
                ├── llm_archive/
                ├── extracted/
                ├── results/
                └── logs/
```

#### **1.3 Real-Time Logging System**
**Issue**: Session logs buffer in memory, not fault tolerant
**Impact**: Lost logs if crash occurs in first 5 minutes
**Solution**: Implement append-only real-time logging

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Replace buffered logging with immediate disk writes
- [ ] Implement <500ms persistence requirement
- [ ] Add log rotation and compression
- [ ] Create log recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Test fault tolerance with simulated crashes

#### **1.4 THIN Schema Transformation**
**Issue**: Hardcoded CFF patterns break with other frameworks/models
**Impact**: System fails with Claude, GPT, or custom frameworks
**Solution**: Replace THICK parsing with LLM-to-LLM transformation

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Remove hardcoded CFF extraction patterns
- [ ] Implement LLM-driven schema flattening
- [ ] Create framework-agnostic transformation prompts
- [ ] Test with multiple LLM providers (Claude, GPT, Gemini)
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for transformation failures

### **Phase 2: User Experience Improvements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

#### **2.1 Human-Readable Score Display**
**Issue**: Logs show "tantalizing" score previews but cut off juicy details
**Impact**: Researchers can't monitor actual CFF scores during runs
**Solution**: Show full CFF anchor scores in human-readable format

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Modify session logging to show complete scores
- [ ] Format scores for human readability (not hash truncation)
- [ ] Add confidence levels and supporting evidence
- [ ] Create real-time score monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Implement score threshold alerts

#### **2.2 True Conversation Logging**
**Issue**: "Conversation log" contains workflow telemetry, not LLM interactions
**Impact**: No record of actual prompts/responses for debugging
**Solution**: Capture actual LLM conversations with full context

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Separate workflow telemetry from conversation logs
- [ ] Capture complete prompt/response pairs
- [ ] Include model metadata and timing information
- [ ] Add conversation replay capabilities
- [ ] Implement conversation search and filtering

#### **2.3 Performance Parallelization**
**Issue**: Sequential processing makes experiments painfully slow
**Impact**: Hour-long experiments could run in 15-20 minutes
**Solution**: Implement intelligent parallelization across the workflow

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Parallel LLM analysis calls within batches
- [ ] Concurrent data extraction while analysis continues
- [ ] Progressive CSV writing as results arrive
- [ ] Batch processing for similar operations
- [ ] Resource management to prevent API overload

#### **2.4 Session Resumption System**
**Issue**: No way to resume failed experiments from checkpoint
**Impact**: Expensive LLM costs lost when experiments crash
**Solution**: Implement robust session resumption with state management

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create comprehensive state checkpointing
- [ ] Implement "resume from step X" CLI functionality
- [ ] Add experiment state validation
- [ ] Create resume conflict resolution
- [ ] Test resumption with various failure scenarios

### **Phase 3: Academic Integrity & Provenance (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

#### **3.1 Forensic LLM Version Tracking**
**Issue**: Only records generic model names, not specific versions
**Impact**: Cannot reproduce experiments with exact model versions
**Solution**: Capture complete model provenance metadata

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Record exact model version hashes and build dates
- [ ] Capture model configuration parameters
- [ ] Store model capability metadata
- [ ] Implement model version validation
- [ ] Create provenance export for academic papers

#### **3.2 Statistical Plan Clarification**
**Issue**: Experiment has "deprecated" statistical plan but calculations still needed
**Impact**: CalculationAgent unclear about required calculations
**Solution**: Clarify calculation requirements in framework specifications

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update Framework Specification v4.0 for calculation clarity
- [ ] Migrate existing experiments to new calculation format
- [ ] Document calculation specification standards
- [ ] Create calculation validation tools
- [ ] Test calculation accuracy across frameworks

#### **3.3 Comprehensive Cost Reporting**
**Issue**: Individual call costs tracked but no session/experiment summaries
**Impact**: Researchers can't budget or optimize experiment costs
**Solution**: Implement hierarchical cost reporting and budgeting

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Session-level cost aggregation
- [ ] Experiment-level cost reporting
- [ ] Cost projection for planned experiments
- [ ] Budget alerts and limits
- [ ] Cost optimization recommendations

### **Phase 4: System Reliability & Monitoring (LOW PRIORITY)**

#### **4.1 Health Monitoring Dashboard**
**Issue**: No visibility into system health or performance
**Impact**: Issues discovered too late, poor operational awareness
**Solution**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create system health dashboard
- [ ] Implement performance metrics collection
- [ ] Add alerting for system issues
- [ ] Create operational runbooks
- [ ] Implement automated health checks

#### **4.2 Error Classification & Recovery**
**Issue**: All errors treated equally, no intelligent recovery
**Impact**: Experiments fail unnecessarily on recoverable errors
**Solution**: Implement error taxonomy and recovery strategies

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Classify error types (transient, permanent, recoverable)
- [ ] Implement error-specific recovery strategies
- [ ] Add intelligent retry mechanisms
- [ ] Create error reporting and analytics
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation patterns

- Measure success against actual researcher workflow needs

### **2. Backward Compatibility**
- Existing experiments must work with new architecture
- Preserve all existing data and provenance
- Provide migration tools for legacy experiments

### **3. Testing Strategy**
- Each phase must pass end-to-end validation
- Use existing MVA experiments as integration tests
- Simulate failure scenarios to validate fault tolerance

### **4. Documentation Excellence**
- Every change must update relevant documentation
- Create migration guides for existing users
- Document operational procedures for system administrators
