## Strategic Context

Discernus aims to democratize framework-based text analysis by providing rapid, reliable insights across arbitrary research frameworks. Our current synthesis architecture hits fundamental scalability limits when processing large corpora (40+ documents) with complex frameworks, failing due to LLM output token constraints and mathematical unreliability.

The strategic opportunity is to achieve **"mean time to insight"** superiority over traditional research methods while maintaining framework generalizability. A gifted researcher with pandas can produce superior analysis for any specific experiment, but requires days/weeks per analysis and custom coding for each framework type. We seek to provide 80% of expert-level insights in 5% of expert-level time across any framework-compliant experiment.

This positions Discernus as the research acceleration platform that scales expert-level analytical thinking to problems and timeframes where hiring domain experts isn't practical.

## Problem Statement

**Current Synthesis Limitations:**
1. **Output Token Ceiling**: All top-tier LLMs (Claude, Gemini Pro) have ~5500-8000 token output limits that cannot accommodate comprehensive synthesis of large experiments
2. **Mathematical Unreliability**: LLMs produce inconsistent statistical calculations and occasionally hallucinate numerical results
3. **Framework Specificity**: Current architecture requires manual optimization for each framework type, limiting generalizability
4. **Cognitive Overload**: Monolithic synthesis agents attempt to simultaneously integrate data, calculate statistics, detect patterns, AND generate narratives within token constraints
5. **Evidence Integration Paradox**: Removing evidence.csv to reduce tokens makes synthesis harder by eliminating structural scaffolding that helps LLMs organize analysis

**Core Challenge**: We need synthesis that scales to arbitrarily large corpora while maintaining framework agnosticism, analytical reliability, and intelligent evidence integration.

## Proposed Solution: THIN Code-Generated Synthesis with Separation of Concerns

### Architectural Philosophy

The breakthrough insight is **separation of concerns**: deterministic computation should be separated from subjective judgment, with proper sequencing to ensure each agent has the context needed for intelligent decision-making.

**Core Principle**: Instead of asking LLMs to perform analysis, we ask them to design analysis strategies and make informed judgments about results.

### 4-Agent Architecture with Proper Sequencing

#### **Agent 1: AnalyticalCodeGenerator**
**Role**: Framework interpretation and statistical strategy generation  
**Intelligence Type**: LLM-based analytical reasoning  
**Input**: Framework specification, experiment configuration, data schema  
**Output**: Executable Python analysis code using pandas/scipy  

**Why This Works**: LLMs excel at understanding context and translating analytical requirements into code patterns. By constraining the task to code generation (not execution), we leverage LLM intelligence while avoiding mathematical unreliability.

**Design Principle**: Generate deterministic statistical operations only—no subjective decisions, no evidence handling, pure mathematical analysis.

```python
# Example generated code - pure statistical focus
def analyze_character_data(scores_df, metadata_df):
    # Framework-specific statistical approach
    descriptive_stats = scores_df.groupby('president').mean()
    virtue_correlations = scores_df[virtue_dimensions].corr()
    temporal_trends = scores_df.groupby('decade').mean()
    
    return {
        'individual_profiles': descriptive_stats,
        'correlations': virtue_correlations,
        'temporal_evolution': temporal_trends
    }
```

#### **Agent 2: CodeExecutor** 
**Role**: Deterministic code execution  
**Intelligence Type**: Pure software (no LLM)  
**Input**: Generated Python code + scores.csv  
**Output**: Statistical results (numbers, correlations, trends)  

**Why This Works**: Mathematical calculations are handled by proven libraries (pandas/scipy) rather than unreliable LLM computation. This ensures 100% mathematical accuracy and eliminates token limits on data processing.

**Design Principle**: Execute code in sandboxed environment, return structured statistical results only.

#### **Agent 3: EvidenceCurator** 
**Role**: Intelligent evidence selection based on statistical findings  
**Intelligence Type**: LLM-based subjective judgment  
**Input**: Statistical results + evidence.csv + framework specification  
**Output**: Curated evidence samples with clear provenance  

**Why This Sequencing Matters**: The EvidenceCurator makes informed decisions based on actual statistical results rather than guessing what might be relevant. This solves the "Evidence CSV Paradox" by preserving evidence scaffolding while ensuring intelligent selection.

**Design Principle**: Select existing evidence that illustrates statistical patterns—never modify or hallucinate quotes, maintain clear artifact_id provenance.

```python
# EvidenceCurator sees actual results and selects accordingly
"""
STATISTICAL FINDINGS:
- Unity scores declined 15% from 1990s (0.45) to 2000s (0.38)
- Strong correlation between truth and justice (r=0.81)
- Obama scored highest on hope dimension (0.72)

Select quotes that illustrate these specific patterns.
"""
```

#### **Agent 4: ResultsInterpreter**
**Role**: Final synthesis integrating statistical results with curated evidence  
**Intelligence Type**: LLM-based narrative synthesis  
**Input**: Statistical results + curated evidence + framework specification  
**Output**: Final research narrative  

**Why This Works**: With reliable statistics and intelligently selected evidence, the ResultsInterpreter can focus purely on synthesis without computational overhead. Token limits are manageable because the heavy analytical lifting is already complete.

**Design Principle**: Weave statistical findings with supporting evidence into coherent academic narrative, staying within token constraints through focused scope.

### Information Flow and Separation of Concerns

```python
def separated_concerns_synthesis(framework_path, experiment_path, corpus_path):
    # Step 1: Generate pure statistical analysis strategy
    statistical_code = analytical_code_generator.generate_code(
        framework_spec=framework_spec,
        focus='deterministic_analysis_only'  # No evidence, no subjective decisions
    )
    
    # Step 2: Execute statistical code (deterministic, reliable)
    statistical_results = code_executor.execute_analysis(
        code=statistical_code,
        data_files={'scores_csv': f"{corpus_path}/scores.csv"}
    )
    
    # Step 3: Intelligent evidence curation based on actual results
    curated_evidence = evidence_curator.curate_evidence(
        statistical_results=statistical_results,  # Real findings to illustrate
        evidence_df=load_evidence_csv(f"{corpus_path}/evidence.csv"),
        framework_spec=framework_spec
    )
    
    # Step 4: Final synthesis with both statistical backbone and evidence salt
    narrative = results_interpreter.synthesize(
        statistical_results=statistical_results,  # The analytical meat
        curated_evidence=curated_evidence,        # The illustrative salt
        framework_spec=framework_spec
    )
    
    return narrative
```

### Why This Architecture Solves Core Problems

#### **1. Token Limit Resolution**
- **Agent 1**: Generates code (2-3K tokens max)
- **Agent 2**: No tokens (pure software execution)
- **Agent 3**: Evidence curation (2-3K tokens max)
- **Agent 4**: Final synthesis (3-4K tokens max)
- **Total**: ~7-10K tokens vs. current 50K+ with retries

#### **2. Mathematical Reliability**
- All calculations performed by pandas/scipy (100% accurate)
- LLMs only generate code strategy, never perform math
- Statistical results are deterministic and verifiable

#### **3. Framework Generalizability**
- Agent 1 adapts statistical approach based on framework requirements
- Agent 3 adapts evidence selection based on framework priorities
- Agent 4 adapts narrative style based on framework context
- No framework-specific engineering required

#### **4. Evidence Integration Intelligence**
- Evidence preserved and intelligently curated (not randomly sampled)
- Curation based on actual statistical findings (not guesswork)
- Clear provenance maintained (no hallucinated quotes)
- Structural scaffolding preserved for synthesis quality

#### **5. Scalability**
- Statistical analysis scales with pandas performance (not LLM limits)
- Evidence curation scales through intelligent sampling
- No fundamental corpus size constraints

### Key Innovation: Post-Computation Evidence Curation

**Traditional Approach**: Select evidence before analysis (blind sampling)  
**Our Approach**: Select evidence after analysis (informed curation)

This enables the EvidenceCurator to make intelligent decisions:
- "Show me quotes that illustrate the 15% decline in unity scores"
- "Find examples of high truth-justice correlation"
- "Select evidence that demonstrates outlier patterns"

Rather than:
- "Give me some random quotes about unity"
- "Sample evidence proportionally across dimensions"

## Falsifiable Hypotheses

### **H1: Reliability Hypothesis**
Code-generated synthesis will achieve >95% success rate on large experiments (40+ documents) compared to ~60-70% success rate of current monolithic approach.

**Falsification Criteria**: If code-generated approach achieves <90% success rate across 20 test experiments, hypothesis is rejected.

**Rationale**: Separation of concerns eliminates the cognitive overload that causes current synthesis failures. Each agent has a focused, manageable task.

### **H2: Speed Hypothesis**  
Code-generated synthesis will complete large experiment synthesis in <10 minutes compared to 26-48 hours for traditional researcher approach.

**Falsification Criteria**: If median synthesis time exceeds 15 minutes for experiments with 40+ documents, hypothesis is rejected.

**Rationale**: Most computation happens at pandas speed (seconds), not LLM speed (minutes). Total LLM time is <5 minutes across all agents.

### **H3: Framework Generalizability Hypothesis**
Single code-generation architecture will successfully adapt to ≥5 different framework types (temporal, comparative, psychological, network, ethical) without framework-specific engineering.

**Falsification Criteria**: If architecture requires >20% custom code changes for any new framework type, hypothesis is rejected.

**Rationale**: LLMs can interpret framework requirements and generate appropriate statistical approaches without hardcoded logic for each framework type.

### **H4: Quality Maintenance Hypothesis**
Code-generated synthesis will achieve ≥80% of expert-quality insights as measured by blind researcher evaluation.

**Falsification Criteria**: If expert evaluators rate code-generated insights <70% quality compared to manual analysis, hypothesis is rejected.

**Rationale**: Combination of reliable statistics + intelligent evidence curation + focused synthesis should approach expert quality while maintaining speed advantages.

### **H5: Cost Efficiency Hypothesis**
Code-generated approach will reduce total synthesis cost (including researcher time) by ≥60% compared to current approach.

**Falsification Criteria**: If total cost reduction is <40%, hypothesis is rejected.

**Rationale**: Dramatic reduction in LLM token usage + elimination of failed synthesis retries + researcher time savings justify higher per-synthesis complexity.

## Post-Prototyping Optimization Opportunities

### **Data Format Optimization**

**Current Approach**: The architecture is designed to work with the existing v5 CSV-based output contracts (scores.csv + evidence.csv).

**Potential Optimization**: Analysis suggests the new architecture might work more effectively with the original v4 JSON-based output contracts, which provide:
- Richer data structure with reasoning and confidence scores
- Natural evidence organization by dimension  
- Better framework generalizability
- Enhanced context for intelligent agent decision-making

**Contingency Plan**: If Phase 1-2 prototyping validates the core architecture, Phase 3 should include comparative testing of:
1. **CSV-based implementation** (current plan)
2. **JSON-based implementation** (using v4 output contracts)
3. **Hybrid approach** (JSON for rich analysis, CSV for statistical processing)

**Success Criteria for Format Migration**: JSON-based approach should demonstrate:
- ≥10% improvement in evidence curation relevance
- ≥15% improvement in narrative synthesis quality  
- ≥20% reduction in framework adaptation complexity
- Maintained or improved processing speed and reliability

**Implementation Note**: JSON-based prototyping can use synthetic analysis artifacts matching v4 output contract specifications, eliminating dependency on historical data extraction.
