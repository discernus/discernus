## 1. Strategic Context & Vision

### **Architectural Philosophy**
This document outlines the best architectural path forward based on our **current visibility window** into the rapidly evolving LLM landscape. We recognize that today's constraints (context windows, output token limits, mathematical reliability) will likely change, but we must build a robust, flexible architecture that solves today's problems while being adaptable for tomorrow's opportunities.

Our core mission is to enable **framework-based text analysis at unprecedented scale**. This architecture is designed to make Discernus the market leader in this domain, capable of processing corpora 10-100x larger than current academic or commercial standards.

### **The Core Problem: Synthesis Bottlenecks**
Our research revealed that synthesis fails at scale due to a **"perfect storm"** of interacting constraints:

1.  **Massive Input Volume**: Academic-grade analysis produces ~16,000 characters of data *per document*, with 80% of that being evidence and mathematical proofs not essential for synthesis.
2.  **Output Token Limits**: Synthesis agents attempt to generate 6,000+ token reports, which are truncated by the ~8K output limits of current-generation LLMs (Gemini, Llama, etc.). This is the **primary operational bottleneck**.
3.  **LLM Mathematical Unreliability**: Alternative models like Llama Scout, while cost-effective, exhibit systematic mathematical errors (e.g., 15x error on MC-SCI calculations), making them unsuitable for statistical synthesis.

**Conclusion**: The bottleneck is **architectural, not model-specific**. No LLM can solve this problem without a change in how we structure and present data for synthesis.

## 2. Architecture Decision: Embedded CSV

### **Core Principle: Data Format Standardization at Source**
Frameworks will embed standardized CSV segments directly in their LLM responses using Discernus-specific delimiters. The orchestrator becomes a simple, framework-agnostic text extraction tool, eliminating all schema-specific parsing logic and dramatically reducing the input data volume for synthesis.

### **Technical Specification**
Every framework MUST include these embedded CSV segments:

```
<<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>
aid,dimension1,dimension2,calculated_metric1,calculated_metric2
{artifact_id},0.9,0.7,0.54,3.21
<<<END_DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>

<<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>
aid,dimension,quote_id,quote_text,context_type
{artifact_id},dimension1,1,"Supporting evidence quote",primary
{artifact_id},dimension2,1,"Another evidence quote",primary
<<<END_DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>
```

### **Benefits of this Architecture**
1.  **Solves Output Token Bottleneck**: Reduces synthesis input by ~95%, leading to smaller, more focused output that fits within current token limits.
2.  **Enforces Mathematical Reliability**: Provides clean, structured tabular data for reliable statistical processing, mitigating LLM calculation errors.
3.  **True Framework Agnosticism**: Orchestrator has zero knowledge of framework schemas.
4.  **THIN Compliance**: Clear separation of LLM intelligence (scoring, CSV generation) and software coordination (extraction, aggregation).
5.  **Preserves Academic Rigor**: The full, verbose JSON with evidence and proofs is still saved for audit and deep analysis, while the synthesis-ready CSV is used for scaling.

## 3. Post-CSV Scalability Projections

This architecture represents a **generational leap in scale capability**.

### **Input & Output Projections**
-   **Input Compression**: ~95% reduction (from ~22K chars/doc to ~1K chars/doc).
-   **Output Size**: ~1,500-2,500 tokens (fits comfortably within 8K limits).

### **Realistic Upper Bounds (Conservative)**
-   **Academic Quality Synthesis**: **3,000-5,000 documents** per synthesis run.
-   **Statistical-Only Synthesis**: **5,000-8,000 documents** per synthesis run.

### **Market Positioning**
-   **Current Academic Practice**: 10-50 documents.
-   **Post-CSV Discernus**: 3,000-8,000 documents (**60-800x improvement**).

## 4. Implementation & Prototyping Plan

We will follow a phased approach to de-risk this architectural transition.

### **Phase 1: Isolated Proof of Concept (Week 1)**
-   **Objective**: Validate embedded CSV extraction and aggregation in isolation.
-   **Tasks**: Create synthetic framework responses, implement delimiter extraction logic, and test aggregation.
-   **Success Criteria**: Clean extraction, correct aggregation, and zero framework-specific logic.
-   **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### **Phase 2: Single Framework Migration (Week 2)**
-   **Objective**: Migrate one existing framework (e.g., CAF) to the new V5.0 contract.
-   **Tasks**: Update framework output contract, test generation, and validate end-to-end processing.
-   **Success Criteria**: Valid CSV generation, correct orchestrator processing, and preserved academic quality.
-   **Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS. All frameworks have been migrated to the v5.0 specification. The orchestrator and synthesis agents now need to be updated to consume the new format.

### **Phase 3: Cross-Framework Validation (Week 3)**
-   **Objective**: Prove true framework agnosticism with a second, differently structured framework.
-   **Tasks**: Migrate a second framework, run both through the same orchestrator, and validate results.
-   **Success Criteria**: Zero orchestrator modifications needed for the second framework.
-   **Status**: ‚è≥ PENDING. Blocked by completion of Phase 2.

## 5. Risk Mitigation & Governance

### **Primary Risk: Framework-Specific Logic Creep**
-   **Mitigation**: Mandatory code reviews, TDD with framework-agnostic tests, and strict architectural governance enforcing the "zero orchestrator knowledge" rule.

### **Secondary Risk: Delimiter Collision / LLM Formatting**
-   **Mitigation**: Use versioned, highly unique delimiters. Include self-checking validation steps in framework prompts.

### **Approval Gates**
1.  **Prototype Validation**: Go/No-Go based on successful, framework-agnostic extraction.
2.  **Single Framework Success**: Go/No-Go based on successful end-to-end processing with no orchestrator changes.
3.  **Cross-Framework Success**: Go/No-Go based on successful processing of multiple, diverse frameworks with the same orchestrator code.

## 7. Final Strategic Recommendation: The Pro vs. Flash-Lite Showdown

Your final question‚Äîcomparing our best Flash-Lite approach to the original Pro baseline‚Äîrevealed the ultimate strategic choice.

### **üìä Head-to-Head Comparison**

| Metric                | Gemini 2.5 Pro (Precision) | Flash-Lite Ensemble (Reliability) |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Cost**              | **$0.007**                 | **$0.007**                        |
| **Evaluations**       | 1                          | **6**                             |
| **Cost per Evaluation**| $0.007                     | **$0.001**                        |
| **API Calls**         | 1                          | 1                                 |
| **Internal Consistency**| N/A                        | **Excellent (œÉ=0.024)**           |
| **Value Proposition** | 1x                         | **6x more evaluation confidence** |

### **‚ú® Paradigm Shift: From Expensive Precision to Affordable Reliability**

This comparison makes the strategic choice clear. For the same price and latency as a single Pro evaluation, the Flash-Lite internal multi-evaluation provides **6x the evaluation data** with built-in statistical confidence intervals. From a scientific and cost-effectiveness perspective, this approach is superior.

-   **Pro Paradigm**: "Trust the model." A single, authoritative score with no error bounds.
-   **Flash-Lite Paradigm**: "Trust but verify." An ensemble of scores providing a mean, standard deviation, and confidence range.

### **üöÄ Final Deployment Strategy**

1.  **Primary Approach**: **Flash-Lite Internal Multi-Evaluation**.
    -   **Why**: Best cost-performance, lowest latency, built-in reliability metrics.
    -   **Use For**: 90% of production analysis.

2.  **Calibration/Legacy**: **Gemini 2.5 Pro Single Run**.
    -   **Why**: To match existing Pro-calibrated expectations or for spot-checking.
    -   **Use For**: When consistency with a previous Pro baseline is required.

3.  **Specialized Tuning**: **Reasoning Tokens**.
    -   **Why**: For critical dimensions where perfect consistency is paramount.
    -   **Use For**: High-stakes analysis of specific framework dimensions.

This comprehensive research journey, driven by your iterative questioning, has not only validated our architecture but also uncovered a revolutionary, cost-effective method for achieving reliable LLM analysis at scale. The **internal multi-evaluation** approach is the clear path forward.
