# Statistical Preparation Offramp
*Strategic Enhancement to Discernus Orchestration*

---

## Executive Summary

**Proposal**: Add a "Statistical Preparation" stage between Analysis and Synthesis that produces researcher-ready datasets for external statistical analysis, creating a clean offramp for users who trust Discernus for text processing but prefer their own analytical tools.

**Market Position**: "Discernus handles large-scale text analysis; researchers handle statistical interpretation and conclusions."

**Implementation**: New CLI flag `--statistical-prep` that stops after producing executable Python notebooks with framework-specific derived metrics calculations and complete provenance.

---

## Strategic Rationale

### The Trust Boundary Problem

Current Discernus offers an all-or-nothing proposition: either accept our complete analysis pipeline (including statistical analysis and interpretation) or don't use the system at all. This creates a trust barrier for researchers who:

- **Trust us for text processing**: "I don't want to manually score 1000 documents"
- **Don't trust us for statistics**: "I'll choose my own statistical methods"
- **Don't trust us for interpretation**: "I'll draw my own research conclusions"

### Target User Profile

**Primary**: Academic researchers conducting text analysis studies who:
- Have expertise in statistical analysis using R, Python, STATA, or SPSS
- Need large-scale text processing capabilities beyond manual coding
- Require methodological control over statistical analysis and interpretation
- Must satisfy peer review standards for statistical rigor
- Want to collaborate with colleagues using different analytical approaches

**Secondary**: Research teams where roles are divided:
- **Data preparation specialist**: Uses Discernus for text processing
- **Statistical analyst**: Uses domain-specific tools for analysis
- **Domain expert**: Provides theoretical interpretation

### Competitive Advantage

This positions Discernus as:
- **Best-in-class text processor**: Excellence in LLM-powered dimensional scoring
- **Researcher-friendly**: Respects academic expertise and methodological preferences  
- **Collaboration enabler**: Multiple researchers can analyze same processed dataset
- **Quality focused**: Concentrate resources on text analysis excellence, not statistical consulting

## Current Architecture Gap

### Existing Orchestration Stages
```
Pre-Flight â†’ Analysis â†’ Synthesis â†’ Finalization
Validation     Stage     Stage       Stage
```

### Proposed Enhancement
```
Pre-Flight â†’ Analysis â†’ Statistical â†’ Synthesis â†’ Finalization
Validation     Stage    Preparation     Stage       Stage
                          â†“ OFFRAMP
                     Executable Python
                        Notebook
```

### The Missing Link

Currently, researchers must choose between:
1. **Analysis only** (`--analysis-only`): Raw LLM outputs, no derived metrics
2. **Complete pipeline**: Full synthesis with interpretation they may not want

**Gap**: No option for "analysis + framework calculations + researcher handoff"

## Statistical Preparation Package Design

### Core Philosophy
**"Provide executable, transparent notebooks that researchers can run, modify, and extend"**

### Package Structure
```
discernus_analysis_package/
â”œâ”€â”€ derived_metrics_notebook.py     # Primary executable notebook
â”œâ”€â”€ analysis_data.json             # Structured analysis results

discernus run --statistical-prep

# Resume from statistical preparation to full synthesis
discernus run --resume-from-stats

# Existing modes remain unchanged
discernus run --analysis-only
discernus run  # Complete pipeline
```

### ThinOrchestrator Modifications

#### New Stage Integration
```python
def run_experiment(self, 
                  statistical_prep_only: bool = False,
                  resume_from_stats: bool = False,
                  **kwargs):
    
    # ... existing analysis logic ...
    
    if statistical_prep_only:
        # Generate executable notebook with derived metrics calculations
        notebook_hash = self._calculate_derived_metrics(
            scores_hash, evidence_hash, framework_content, experiment_config
        )
        
        return self._finalize_statistical_preparation(notebook_hash)
    
    # ... continue to synthesis if not statistical prep only ...
```

#### New Notebook Generation Functions
- `_calculate_derived_metrics()`: Generate executable Python notebook using NotebookGeneratorAgent
- `NotebookGeneratorAgent.generate_derived_metrics_notebook()`: LLM-powered notebook generation
- `_finalize_statistical_preparation()`: Complete stage with notebook deliverable

### Content-Addressable Storage Integration

**Notebook Caching**: 
- `notebook_hash`: SHA256 of generated Python notebook
- Enables resume capability from statistical preparation stage
- Maintains complete provenance chain

**Notebook Versioning**:
- Generated notebooks are cached and versioned
- Researchers can regenerate identical notebooks for replication
- Changes to framework or processing trigger new notebook generation
- Notebooks include embedded metadata for full reproducibility

> Discernus generated dimensional scores and an executable Python notebook for calculating 
> framework-specified composite measures. All statistical analysis and interpretation was 
> performed independently using the generated notebook and additional analyses in [Python/R/STATA] 
> following standard practices in [research domain]."

#### In Results Section
