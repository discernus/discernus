# Research Transparency Stakeholder Requirements

**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Active Development  
**Purpose**: Define transparency and audit requirements for LLM-based research to exceed traditional methodological standards

---

## Overview

As marginalized mavericks introducing LLM methodology to academic research, we must work harder to gain respect. Traditional qualitative research relies on "3 undergrads, pizza, and Îº = 0.67" yet questions our systematic, reproducible, and scalable approach. 

**Our mission**: Provide transparency so comprehensive that critics realize we are the opposite of a black box.

## Stakeholder Question Matrix

### 1. Primary Researcher (Post-Experiment)
**Context**: "I just completed an experiment run. What do I need to know?"

**Core Questions**:
- **What did I find?** (key patterns, statistical significance, effect sizes)
- **How confident should I be in these results?** (reliability metrics, sample sizes, model consistency)
- **What evidence best supports my claims?** (strongest quotes, clearest examples)
- **Are there any obvious methodological issues?** (framework fit, model performance, edge cases)
- **What's the story I can tell?** (narrative arc, practical implications)
- **Can I defend this methodology?** (framework choice, corpus selection, analysis parameters)

**Required Deliverables**:
- Executive summary with key findings
- Statistical confidence metrics
- Evidence quality rankings
- Methodological health check
- Publication-ready narrative outline

### 2. Internal Reviewer/Colleague  
**Context**: "Please review this research before submission."

**Core Questions**:
- **Is the analytical framework appropriate for the research question?**
- **Is the corpus representative and unbiased?**
- **Are the statistical methods sound?** (appropriate tests, multiple comparisons, effect sizes)
- **Do the conclusions match the evidence?** (cherry-picking, overgeneralization)
- **Are there alternative explanations?** (confounding variables, methodological artifacts)
- **Is the writing clear and claims appropriately hedged?**
- **Would this pass peer review?**

**Required Deliverables**:
- Framework-question fit assessment
- Corpus bias analysis
- Statistical methodology review
- Evidence-conclusion alignment check
- Peer review readiness score

### 3. Replication Researcher
**Context**: "I want to replicate this study and test variations."

**Core Questions**:
- **Exactly what framework version was used?** (with all parameters)
- **What was the precise corpus composition?** (sources, dates, selection criteria)
- **What models/settings were used for analysis?** (temperature, tokens, provider)
- **How were edge cases handled?** (parsing errors, ambiguous texts)
- **What was the exact analytical pipeline?** (step-by-step process)
- **Where can I get identical input materials?** (framework files, corpus texts)
- **What variations should I test?** (robustness checks, sensitivity analysis)

**Required Deliverables**:
- Complete computational reproducibility package
- Step-by-step pipeline documentation
- Input material access instructions
- Suggested robustness tests
- Known edge cases and handling procedures

### 4. Fraud Auditor (Academic Misconduct Investigation)
**Context**: "Investigating allegations of research misconduct."

**Core Questions**:
- **Did analysis precede conclusions?** (timestamps, iteration history)
- **Were results cherry-picked from multiple runs?** (complete run history, failed experiments)
- **Was the framework or corpus manipulated post-hoc?** (version control, modification logs)
- **Are all data sources authentic?** (corpus provenance, text authenticity)
- **Did external factors influence results?** (funding, conflicts of interest)
- **Can every claim be traced to specific evidence?** (citation auditing, quote verification)
- **Are statistical calculations correct?** (reproducible math, no p-hacking)

**Required Deliverables**:
- Complete chronological audit trail
- All experiment runs (successes and failures)
- Version-controlled input materials
- Source authentication records
- Citation-to-evidence mapping
- Mathematical calculation verification

### 5. LLM Methodology Skeptic
**Context**: "I don't trust LLM research methods. Prove your rigor."

#### Model Transparency Questions:
- **Exactly what model?** (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, gpt-4-1106-preview, gemini-pro-1.5-001)
- **What provider/API version?** (OpenAI API v1.2.3, Anthropic API 2024-06-01)
- **What inference parameters?** (temperature, top_p, max_tokens, seed, system prompts)
- **How do results vary by model?** (cross-model validation, ensemble agreement)
- **Why this model over alternatives?** (justified model selection, pilot comparisons)

#### Reliability & Consistency Questions:
- **Multi-run reliability:** Cronbach's Î± across 5+ identical runs
- **Inter-model reliability:** Agreement between GPT-4, Claude, Gemini on same corpus
- **Prompt sensitivity:** How much do results change with prompt variations?
- **Framework robustness:** Same conclusions with different but related frameworks?
- **Human-AI agreement:** How well do LLM scores correlate with human raters?

#### Methodological Rigor Questions:
- **Pre-registration:** Was the analytical plan specified before seeing results?
- **Multiple comparisons:** Proper correction for testing many hypotheses?
- **Model drift:** How do results change as models get updated?
- **Corpus contamination:** Were any texts in the model's training data?
- **Prompt engineering:** How many iterations before settling on prompts?

#### Replication & Robustness:
- **Computational reproducibility:** Exact same results with same inputs?
- **Conceptual replication:** Same findings with different LLMs/prompts?
- **Stress testing:** Results hold with adversarial examples?
- **Generalizability:** Findings replicate on out-of-sample corpus?

**Required Deliverables**:
- Complete model provenance logs
- Multi-model validation studies
- Human-LLM comparison benchmarks  
- Prompt development audit trails
- Cross-run reliability metrics
- Model selection justification
- Robustness testing results

## The Traditional Research Hypocrisy

**Traditional "Gold Standard" Method**:
- 3 undergrads from Psych 101
- 2 hours of training on a Friday afternoon  
- Pizza and $50 gift cards
- Inter-rater reliability Îº = 0.67 ("acceptable!")
- 47 documents analyzed over 3 weeks
- No audit trail of decisions
- "Coder fatigue" effects ignored
- Published with confidence

**Our "Questionable" LLM Method**:
- Exact model version logged to the API call
- Complete prompt engineering audit trail
- Perfect replication (same input â†’ same output)
- 10,000+ documents in 2 hours
- Cronbach's Î± across multiple runs
- Every decision timestamped and logged
- Statistical power through massive scale
- Still questioned by reviewers

**Our Standard**: More rigorous than pizza-powered undergrads. âœ…
