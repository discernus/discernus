## üîç **Analysis Quality Comparison**

### **Individual Dimension Assessment**

**High Agreement Dimensions (¬±0.1 variance typical)**:
- **Tribalism**: Both models consistently identify populist vs unifying rhetoric
- **Manipulation**: Strong agreement on deceptive vs transparent communication
- **Fantasy**: Both correctly assess realistic vs unrealistic promises
- **Basic virtue/vice patterns**: Core character trait identification is reliable

**Moderate Variance Dimensions (¬±0.2 variance)**:
- **Fear vs Hope balance**: Some differences in emphasis weighting
- **Truth assessment**: Varying interpretation of factual vs aspirational claims
- **Resentment detection**: Different sensitivity to grievance undertones

**Higher Variance Dimensions (¬±0.3 variance)**:
- **Justice interpretation**: Different focus on retributive vs distributive justice
- **Dignity assessment**: Varying emphasis on universal vs conditional respect

### **Calculated Metrics Assessment**

**Critical Issue Identified**: **MC-SCI calculation methodology differs significantly**

**Gemini Pattern**: MC-SCI scores range 0.35-0.65 (moderate to high tension)
**Llama Scout Pattern**: MC-SCI scores range 0.04-0.23 (very low tension)

**Hypothesis**: Llama Scout may be using a different tension calculation method or threshold interpretation, despite reaching the same character classification conclusions.
