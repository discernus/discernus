# Discernus v8.1: Architectural Recovery and Test-Driven Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-08-18  
**Status**: Approved Strategic Plan
**Lead**: Senior Architect

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Discernus v8.0 architecture has suffered from systemic integration failures, resulting in a non-functional research pipeline. A comprehensive audit has revealed that while core components for analysis and code generation are fundamentally sound, the system is crippled by a critical "execution gap": it generates essential computational assets but never executes them. Further, the intellectual rigor of core specifications has been degraded, depriving the system of the necessary guidance to produce high-quality academic output.

This document outlines a recovery plan to evolve the system to **v8.1**. The strategy is rooted in a **test-first, component-driven methodology**. We will abandon the fragile end-to-end integration approach and instead build, test, and validate each component in isolation before integration.

The plan involves resurrecting a proven, production-ready `SecureCodeExecutor` from git history, implementing a series of deterministic `Assembler` utilities to manage prompt engineering, and restoring the intellectual depth of our frameworks and experiments. This will produce a simpler, more robust, and more intelligent platform capable of fulfilling its mission.

## 2. Strategic Context: Key Audit Findings

Our path forward is informed by the following critical findings from the [Comprehensive System Audit](system_audit_and_unit_testing_strategy.md):

*   **Analysis Stage is Solid**: The `EnhancedAnalysisAgent` is highly reliable and produces consistent, high-quality structured data. The system's foundation is strong.
*   **Code Generation is a Solved Problem**: LLMs can reliably generate correct, executable Python code for derived metrics and statistical analysis in a single shot.
*   **The "Execution Gap" is the Core Failure**: The central problem is that the system generates code (for metrics, statistics) but never executes it, causing a total breakdown of the data pipeline.
*   **Key Infrastructure was Discarded**: A robust, production-ready `SecureCodeExecutor` and its dependencies were previously built, proven, and then deleted from the codebase.
*   **Specifications Lack Rigor**: The intellectual guidance in frameworks and experiments has been "simplified" to the point of being inadequate, preventing the system from producing credible academic work.
*   **Synthesis is Over-Engineered**: The current three-agent synthesis model is an unnecessary complication based on obsolete token limit concerns.

## 3. Core Methodology: Test-Driven, Component-First Development

To break the cycle of integration failures, all v8.1 development will adhere to the following pattern:

1.  **Define the Contract**: For any new or restored component, first define its precise inputs, outputs, and expected behaviors.
2.  **Write the Unit Test**: Create a comprehensive unit test suite that validates the component's contract. This includes testing for success cases, failure cases, and edge cases. The test must fail initially.
3.  **Implement the Component**: Write the minimum amount of code required to make the unit test pass.
4.  **Refactor and Harden**: Improve the implementation while ensuring all tests continue to pass.
5.  **Integrate**: Only once a component is fully validated in isolation will it be integrated into the broader pipeline.

This methodology applies to all new and restored components outlined below.

## 4. Implementation Plan: Path to v8.1

The recovery will proceed by implementing a series of well-defined, testable components.

### Phase 1: Foundational Infrastructure [STATUS: COMPLETED]

#### **Component 1: Secure Code Execution (`CodeExecutor`)**
*   **Action**: Resurrect the `SecureCodeExecutor`, `LLMCodeSanitizer`, and `CapabilityRegistry` from git history.
*   **Test Plan**:
    *   Verify that the `CodeExecutor` can securely run Python code in a sandboxed environment.
    *   Test resource limits (CPU, memory).
    *   Validate that the `LLMCodeSanitizer` correctly fixes common LLM code errors.
    *   Confirm that the `CapabilityRegistry` correctly manages library permissions.
*   **Definition of Done**: A fully tested `CodeExecutor` service is available for use by the orchestrator.

### Phase 2: Code Generation and Execution Pipeline [STATUS: COMPLETED]

**Major Breakthrough**: This phase has been successfully completed using a **THIN prompting approach** that abandons structured output constraints in favor of precise natural language instructions. Key architectural decisions:

**Structured Output Abandonment**: Through extensive prompt engineering testing, we discovered that **natural prompting produces superior, more reliable code** than structured output constraints. LLMs generate cleaner, more executable code when not forced into artificial JSON schemas.

**Model Selection**: After encountering data integrity failures with `vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash`, the system was upgraded to use `vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro` for all critical operations. Pro model provides superior instruction-following for complex framework specifications, ensuring complete dimensional data and preventing omission errors.

**Security Model Integration**: The `CapabilityRegistry` with preset configurations successfully enables controlled file operations while maintaining security. The `data_aggregation` preset allows necessary operations (`open`, `json`, `pandas`) while blocking dangerous ones.

**End-to-End Validation**: The complete pipeline now successfully processes experiments from analysis → code generation → secure execution → data aggregation → artifact storage, producing complete research deliverables.

#### **Component 2: Analysis Data Aggregation** [STATUS: COMPLETED]
*   **Architectural Achievement**: Successfully implemented the "LLM-as-Code-Generator" pattern where the LLM generates deterministic aggregation scripts rather than performing high-volume data processing directly. This maintains scalability, determinism, and full provenance while keeping the orchestrator THIN and framework-agnostic.
*   **Security Model**: The `CapabilityRegistry` `data_aggregation` preset successfully enables controlled file operations (`open`, `json`, `pandas`, `os.path`, `glob`) while blocking dangerous operations.
*   **Sub-Component 2a: `DataAggregationPromptAssembler`** [COMPLETED]
    *   **Implementation**: Created with THIN prompting approach - precise natural language instructions that consistently produce clean, executable Python code.
    *   **Validation**: Tested and confirmed reliable prompt assembly from framework output schema and analysis file samples.
*   **Sub-Component 2b: Pipeline Integration** [COMPLETED]
    *   **Implementation**: Fully integrated into `ExperimentOrchestrator` using natural prompting with Pro model reliability.
    *   **Validation**: Successfully processes experiments end-to-end, producing correctly structured DataFrames with complete dimensional data.
    *   **Data Integrity Fix**: Resolved `{artifact_id}` placeholder corruption by modifying `process_json_response` to handle complete document hash lists.

#### **Component 3: Derived Metrics Generation and Execution** [STATUS: COMPLETED]
*   **Major Achievement**: Successfully integrated derived metrics calculation using the proven THIN approach, generating 6 new derived metric columns from framework specifications.
*   **Sub-Component 3a: `DerivedMetricsPromptAssembler`** [COMPLETED]
    *   **Implementation**: Enhanced with explicit security constraints (no eval/exec) and nested data structure support.
    *   **Validation**: Successfully generates code that implements mathematical formulas explicitly without dynamic execution.
*   **Sub-Component 3b: Pipeline Integration** [COMPLETED]
    *   **Implementation**: Fully integrated into `ExperimentOrchestrator` with v10.0 specification compliance and Pro model reliability.
    *   **Validation**: Successfully calculates complex derived metrics including tension calculations and composite indices.
    *   **Artifact Persistence**: Derived metrics now properly stored as CSV artifacts with full provenance.

#### **Component 4: Statistical Analysis Pipeline** [STATUS: COMPLETED]
*   **Breakthrough Implementation**: Created `StatisticalAnalysisPromptAssembler` and integrated comprehensive statistical analysis generation using THIN prompting approach.
*   **Results**: Successfully generates and executes statistical analysis code producing 4 result categories including descriptive statistics, correlations, and significance tests.
*   **Security Validation**: Maintains security model while enabling legitimate statistical computations using pandas, numpy, scipy, and statistics libraries.
*   **Artifact Persistence**: Statistical results now properly stored as JSON artifacts (87KB comprehensive analysis).

### Phase 3: Synthesis and Final Reporting [STATUS: COMPLETED]

#### **Component 5: Synthesis Pipeline** [STATUS: COMPLETED]
*   **Major Achievement**: Successfully implemented unified synthesis pipeline generating publication-ready research reports.
*   **Sub-Component 5a: `SynthesisPromptAssembler`** [COMPLETED]
    *   **Implementation**: Created comprehensive prompt assembler that combines framework methodology, experiment objectives, statistical results, and evidence context.
    *   **Validation**: Unit tested and confirmed reliable prompt assembly with proper evidence integration.
*   **Sub-Component 5b: Unified Synthesis Agent** [COMPLETED]
    *   **Implementation**: Replaced complex 3-agent synthesis model with single `UnifiedSynthesisAgent` using proven THIN approach and Pro model reliability.
    *   **Validation**: Successfully generates coherent 21KB research reports with proper academic structure, statistical interpretation, and evidence citations.
*   **Sub-Component 5c: Pipeline Integration** [COMPLETED]
    *   **Implementation**: Fully integrated into `ExperimentOrchestrator` with graceful failure handling and complete artifact organization.
    *   **Validation**: End-to-end pipeline now produces complete research deliverables including publication-ready final reports.

### Phase 4: Intellectual Rigor Restoration [STATUS: COMPLETED]

**Architectural Mandate for Code Generation**: All code-generating agents in the v8.1 architecture standardize on Google's Gemini-series models via Vertex AI. However, **structured output has been abandoned for code generation** after extensive testing revealed that **natural prompting produces superior, more reliable code** than JSON schema constraints. 

**Revised Code Generation Strategy**:
- **For Code Generation**: Use precise natural language instructions with `vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro` for superior reliability and framework compliance
- **For Data Extraction**: Continue using structured output where appropriate (validation responses, data parsing)
- **Format Handling**: Simple regex extraction for markdown code blocks when needed, avoiding complex parsing pipelines

#### **Component 5: Specification and Reference Experiment Overhaul** [STATUS: COMPLETED]
*   **Major Achievement**: Successfully upgraded all specifications to v10.0 standard with comprehensive intellectual rigor.
*   **Sub-Component 5a: Enhanced Specifications** [COMPLETED]
    *   **Implementation**: Created `FRAMEWORK_SPECIFICATION_V10.0.md` and `EXPERIMENT_SPECIFICATION_V10.0.md` with scholarly depth, clear guidance, and machine-readable appendices.
    *   **Validation**: Specifications include conceptual onboarding, term definitions, academic citations, and practical authoring guidance.
*   **Sub-Component 5b: Reference Frameworks** [COMPLETED]
    *   **Implementation**: Created `cff_v10.md` (Cohesive Flourishing Framework) compliant with v10.0 specification, synthesizing best elements from historical versions.
    *   **Validation**: Framework includes robust theoretical foundations, empirical grounding, and comprehensive analytical methodology.
*   **Sub-Component 5c: Validation Architecture** [COMPLETED]
    *   **Implementation**: Elevated `ExperimentCoherenceAgent` as primary validator using v10.0 specifications, successfully identifying and resolving specification inconsistencies.
    *   **Validation**: Agent provides intelligent, actionable feedback for experiment setup coherence.
