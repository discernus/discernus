# Discernus Default Ensemble Research

**Bottom Line:** Establish a three-ensemble strategy that is methodologically sound - establishing a balanced default with performance-optimized and cost-optimized alternatives to provide users clear guidance based on empirical testing rather than vendor marketing claims.

**Opening Framework:**
• Default ensemble: Proven Gemini baseline with measured expansion options
• Performance ensemble: Premium models for publication-grade research
• Economy ensemble: Cost-optimized pipeline for exploratory analysis
• Testing methodology: Empirical validation across representative political discourse corpus

## Recommended Alpha Testing Plan

### **Ensemble 1: "Balanced Default" (Recommended for Most Users)**
**Architecture:** Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite (analysis) + Gemini 2.5 Pro (synthesis)
**Rationale:** Your proven $0.39 baseline with 87%/84% confidence scores
**Target users:** Academic researchers, policy analysts, standard discourse analysis

**Expansion testing:**
- **Fallback option:** Claude Sonnet 4 (both stages) if Gemini reliability issues emerge
- **Cost ceiling:** $0.75-1.00 acceptable for 2x performance improvement

### **Ensemble 2: "Performance Optimized" (Research Publication Grade)**
**Primary candidate:** GPT-4.1 (analysis) + Claude Opus 4 (synthesis)
**Alternative candidate:** Claude Sonnet 4 (analysis) + Claude Opus 4 (synthesis)
**Target cost:** $1.50-2.50 per 63-document analysis
**Target users:** Academic institutions, think tanks, publication-bound research

**Success criteria:**
- >95% framework extraction reliability
- Statistical significance detection improvement
- Superior evidence curation and narrative quality
- Academic writing sophistication measurably enhanced

### **Ensemble 3: "Economy Explorer" (High-Volume/Exploratory)**
**Architecture:** GPT-4.1 nano (analysis) + GPT-4.1 mini (synthesis)
**Target cost:** $0.15-0.30 per analysis
**Target users:** Graduate students, independent researchers, pilot studies

**Testing focus:**
- Minimum viable analysis quality for preliminary research
- Batch processing efficiency for large corpora
- Educational/training use cases

## Testing Methodology Framework

### **Phase 1: Baseline Validation (Days 1-7)**
- Replicate your proven Gemini results on subset (15 documents)
- Establish confidence intervals for all metrics
- Document extraction reliability patterns

### **Phase 2: Alternative Architecture Testing (Days 8-21)**
- Run all three ensembles on identical 20-document representative subset
- Measure: cost, confidence scores, statistical detection, synthesis quality
- A/B test extraction reliability under stress conditions

### **Phase 3: Full Corpus Validation (Days 22-30)**
- Execute winning candidates on complete 63-document corpus
- Generate publication-ready comparative analysis
- Finalize ensemble recommendations with empirical evidence

## Success Metrics for Ensemble Selection

### **Analytical Quality Thresholds:**
- Framework reliability: >90% successful score extraction
- Statistical validity: Replication of key findings (partisan asymmetry, document type differences)
- Evidence curation: Quality assessment via academic peer review

### **Cost-Performance Ratios:**
- **Default ensemble:** <$1.00, maintains Gemini baseline quality
- **Performance ensemble:** <$2.50, demonstrable quality improvement
- **Economy ensemble:** <$0.50, acceptable quality degradation limits

### **User Experience Criteria:**
- Processing time: <15 minutes for full corpus analysis
- Error handling: Graceful degradation for edge cases
- Documentation: Clear guidance on ensemble selection

## Platform Implementation Strategy

### **Alpha Release Recommendations:**
1. **Lead with proven default:** Gemini baseline as primary recommendation
2. **Offer performance upgrade:** Clearly articulated ROI for premium ensemble
3. **Provide economy option:** Transparent trade-offs for budget-conscious users

### **User Guidance Framework:**
- **Publication research:** Performance ensemble with cost justification
- **Exploratory analysis:** Default ensemble for balanced approach
- **Large-scale studies:** Economy ensemble with quality caveats
- **Pilot projects:** Economy ensemble with upgrade path

### **Alpha Testing User Segments:**
- **Academic partners:** Test performance ensemble on real research
- **Graduate researchers:** Validate economy ensemble for thesis work
- **Policy organizations:** Stress-test default ensemble on current events

## Risk Mitigation

### **Model Availability Risks:**
- Maintain fallback options within each ensemble tier
- Test cross-provider compatibility for critical functions
- Document switching procedures for service disruptions

### **Cost Escalation Protection:**
- Set hard spending limits per analysis
- Implement early warning systems for token usage
- Provide cost estimation tools for users

### **Quality Assurance:**
- Establish minimum acceptable confidence score thresholds
- Create automatic quality checks for statistical replication
- Implement human validation workflows for edge cases

This empirical approach ensures your alpha recommendations are grounded in actual performance data rather than theoretical capabilities, providing users with trustworthy guidance for their specific research needs and budget constraints.
