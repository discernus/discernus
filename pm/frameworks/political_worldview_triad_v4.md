# Political Worldview Triad Framework v4.0

**Version**: v4.0  
**Status**: Active

A framework for analyzing political discourse through three distinct sources of legitimacy: Immutable-Identity politics, Tribal Domination, and Pluralist Individual Dignity. This triadic approach captures the fundamental tensions in contemporary political discourse while maintaining analytical precision and theoretical rigor.

---

## Executive Summary

The Political Worldview Triad Framework identifies three competing sources of political legitimacy that shape contemporary democratic discourse. By analyzing how texts appeal to identity-based claims, dominance-seeking narratives, and universal dignity principles, this framework reveals the underlying value structures that drive political communication.

**Core Innovation**: Triadic positioning system that captures the fundamental tension between group-based identity claims, tribal supremacy assertions, and universal dignity appeals without forcing artificial bipolar relationships.

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Three-Dimensional Analysis**: Independent scoring across three distinct worldview anchors
- **Competitive Dynamics**: Detection of worldview conflicts and tensions within discourse
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of pure, hybrid, and transitional worldview positioning
- **Rich Evidence Base**: Multiple quotations per worldview with confidence assessments
- **Theoretical Grounding**: Integration of intersectionality theory, realist politics, and liberal dignity concepts

## Theoretical Foundation

### The Three Sources of Political Legitimacy

This framework synthesizes three major streams of political theory into a coherent analytical system:

**1. Immutable-Identity Politics (Crenshaw)**  
Drawing from intersectionality theory, this approach centers political legitimacy on overlapping, unchosen personal attributes. Politics becomes the expression of lived experience through immutable characteristics like race, gender, sexuality, and disability status.

**2. Tribal Domination (Machiavelli)**  
Rooted in realist political theory, this worldview asserts the legitimacy of in-group supremacy and security. Politics is fundamentally about group survival and dominance in a zero-sum competition for resources and cultural hegemony.

**3. Pluralist Individual Dignity (Kant)**  
Based on liberal dignity theory, this approach locates legitimacy in the transcendent dignity and agency of each person. Politics serves to balance universal civic equality with respectful acknowledgment of human diversity.

### Competitive Dynamics

These three worldviews exist in dynamic tension within democratic discourse:

- **Identity vs. Dignity**: Tension between group-based claims and universal principles
- **Domination vs. Dignity**: Conflict between supremacist and egalitarian visions
- **Identity vs. Domination**: Competition between different forms of group-based politics

This competitive relationship creates rich analytical opportunities for understanding political rhetoric, coalition building, and ideological positioning.

## Framework Dimensions

### Immutable-Identity Politics

**Core Concept**: Politics that centers moral status on overlapping, unchosen personal attributes, viewing these traits as the primary source of advantage or oppression.

**Key Indicators**:
- "As Black women, we...", "Center disabled queer voices"
- "Our lived experience as trans people shows..."
- "Marginalized identities face systemic barriers"
- "Racialized communities continue to struggle"
- "systemic oppression", "lived experience", "intersection of race and gender"

**Theoretical Basis**: Intersectionality theory emphasizing how multiple identity categories create unique forms of oppression and political consciousness.

### Tribal Domination

**Core Concept**: Politics that asserts the legitimacy of an in-group's supremacy, security, or domination over out-groups, often framed in zero-sum or survivalist terms.

**Key Indicators**:
- "We must put our nation first", "They will replace us"
- "Only our tribe can secure the future"
- "Our way of life is under threat"
- "Their culture is incompatible with ours"
- "take back our country", "real patriots", "dominant culture"

**Theoretical Basis**: Realist political theory emphasizing group competition, in-group preference, and survival-based political calculations.

### Pluralist Individual Dignity

**Core Concept**: Politics that locates legitimacy in the transcendent dignity and agency of each person, balancing universal civic equality with respectful acknowledgment of immutable traits.

**Key Indicators**:
- "Every individual deserves equal voice"
- "Citizens, regardless of background, share responsibility"
- "Human dignity transcends race and class"
- "Inclusive civic nationalism", "Equal opportunity for all"
- "universal rights", "shared civic space", "common good through consent"

**Theoretical Basis**: Liberal dignity theory emphasizing universal human worth, individual agency, and inclusive civic community.

## Analytical Methodology

### Scoring Protocol

**Independent Assessment**: Each worldview is scored independently from 0.0 to 1.0 based on:
- **Frequency**: How often worldview-specific language appears
- **Centrality**: How central the worldview is to the text's argument
- **Sophistication**: How developed and nuanced the worldview expression is

**Evidence Requirements**:
- Approximately 2 direct quotations per worldview scoring above 0.3
- Confidence assessment based on evidence clarity and interpretive certainty
- Pattern identification for competitive dynamics and worldview interactions

### Competitive Pattern Recognition

**Pure Positioning**: High score on one worldview, low on others
- Indicates clear ideological positioning and strategic coherence

**Hybrid Discourse**: Moderate to high scores on multiple worldviews
- Indicates coalition-building, audience segmentation, or ideological synthesis

**Competitive Tension**: Evidence of worldview conflict within the text
- Indicates internal contradictions, strategic complexity, or evolving positions

---

## Academic Validation

This framework synthesizes established political theory into a coherent analytical system:

**Intersectionality Theory**: Draws from Kimberlé Crenshaw's foundational work on identity-based political consciousness and the intersection of multiple oppression systems.

**Realist Political Theory**: Incorporates Machiavellian insights about group competition, in-group preference, and survival-based political calculations.

**Liberal Dignity Theory**: Builds on Kantian principles of universal human dignity, individual agency, and the possibility of inclusive civic community.

**Empirical Applications**: Framework has been tested on political speeches, campaign materials, policy documents, and social media discourse with consistent results across contexts.

Your perspective is grounded in political legitimacy research, democratic theory, and contemporary political analysis. Your task is to analyze the provided text using the Political Worldview Triad Framework v4.0. This framework analyzes political discourse through three competing sources of political legitimacy that shape contemporary democratic discourse and political positioning. Score three independent legitimacy dimensions from 0.0 to 1.0 each: IMMUTABLE IDENTITY POLITICS: Political legitimacy from overlapping, unchosen personal attributes - look for 'lived experience', 'intersectionality', 'identity-based representation', 'systemic oppression', 'marginalized voices', 'identity authenticity', 'group experience', 'personal identity', 'immutable characteristics', 'identity-based claims', 'group membership', 'demographic representation', 'identity politics', 'group identity', 'authentic voice', 'representative identity'. TRIBAL DOMINATION: Political legitimacy from in-group supremacy and competitive dominance - look for 'group superiority', 'tribal loyalty', 'us vs them', 'cultural dominance', 'group survival', 'in-group strength', 'group competition', 'tribal supremacy', 'group dominance', 'cultural hegemony', 'group security', 'tribal identity', 'group power', 'competitive advantage', 'group victory', 'tribal warfare'. PLURALIST INDIVIDUAL DIGNITY: Political legitimacy from universal human dignity and individual agency - look for 'individual dignity', 'universal rights', 'human agency', 'civic equality', 'respectful diversity', 'universal principles', 'individual worth', 'human dignity', 'personal agency', 'universal values', 'equal dignity', 'individual rights', 'civic participation', 'democratic equality', 'universal respect', 'individual autonomy'. For each dimension, follow this process: 1. Read the text for specific political legitimacy indicators and democratic authority patterns 2. Identify at least 3 direct quotations that support your legitimacy assessment 3. Score from 0.0 to 1.0 based on frequency, centrality, and intensity of legitimacy appeals 4. Provide confidence rating from 0.0 to 1.0 based on evidence clarity and theoretical grounding. Focus on fundamental sources of political authority and democratic legitimacy while assessing how different worldviews compete for political dominance."
