# Entman Framing Functions Framework (EFF) v4.0
## Strategic Communication Analysis through Framing Functions

---

## What Is This Framework?

The Entman Framing Functions Framework (EFF) analyzes strategic political communication through Robert Entman's foundational four-function framing theory. This framework examines how communicators systematically construct persuasive messages by defining problems, attributing causation, making moral evaluations, and recommending treatments.

**Core Purpose**: EFF reveals whether communication employs sophisticated strategic framing versus ad hoc messaging by analyzing the presence, strength, and independence of Entman's four fundamental framing functions.

**Key Applications**:
- **Strategic Communication Analysis**: Evaluate sophistication and completeness of message construction
- **Frame Independence Testing**: Validate Entman's hypothesis that framing functions operate independently
- **Message Effectiveness Assessment**: Understand how systematic framing affects persuasive impact
- **Communication Strategy Research**: Analyze patterns in strategic versus reactive messaging

## Theoretical Foundation

### Entman's Framing Theory

Robert Entman's groundbreaking "Framing: Toward Clarification of a Fractured Paradigm" (1993) revolutionized communication analysis by identifying four systematic functions that strategic communicators use to construct persuasive messages. Unlike ad hoc messaging, sophisticated strategic communication employs these functions systematically to create coherent, persuasive frames.

**Core Innovation**: Framing as systematic message construction through four independent but complementary functions that can be strategically emphasized or de-emphasized depending on communicative goals.

### Strategic Communication Sophistication

EFF evaluates communication sophistication by examining whether messages employ Entman's systematic framing approach versus reactive, ad hoc messaging patterns. Strategic communication demonstrates:

- **Function Completeness**: Presence of multiple framing functions
- **Function Independence**: Ability to emphasize functions separately based on strategic needs
- **Systematic Integration**: Coherent use of functions to create unified persuasive frames

### Four Independent Framing Functions

**Problem Definition**: Establishing what issues require attention and how problems should be understood
**Causal Attribution**: Identifying who or what is responsible for problems and how causation operates
**Moral Evaluation**: Invoking values and ethical judgments to evaluate situations and actors
**Treatment Recommendation**: Proposing solutions and advocating for specific courses of action

### Independence Hypothesis Testing

Entman's theory predicts these functions operate independently - sophisticated communicators can emphasize problem definition without moral evaluation, or recommend treatments without extensive causal attribution. EFF tests this independence empirically.

## Framework Dimensions

### Problem Definition (0.0-1.0)
**Core Concept**: Communication that identifies issues requiring attention and conceptualizes problems for public understanding

**Strategic Function**: Establishes what deserves public attention, how problems should be understood, and what scope of response is appropriate

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:

**Issue Identification**:
- "the real issue is," "we face a crisis of," "the challenge before us," "the problem we must address"
- "the urgent need to," "what's really at stake," "the fundamental issue," "the core problem"
- "this affects everyone," "widespread implications," "immediate attention required," "crisis demands response"

**Problem Conceptualization**:
- "the nature of this problem," "what we're really dealing with," "the scope of the challenge," "how to understand this"
- "this is fundamentally about," "at its core this involves," "the essential character of," "the basic nature of"
- "problem framework," "conceptual approach," "analytical lens," "systematic understanding," "comprehensive view"

**Public Attention Framing**:
- "requires immediate attention," "demands public focus," "needs urgent consideration," "merits serious examination"
- "public priority," "national concern," "community issue," "collective challenge," "shared responsibility"

### Causal Attribution (0.0-1.0)
**Core Concept**: Communication that identifies who or what is responsible for problems and explains how causation operates

**Strategic Function**: Establishes accountability, explanatory frameworks, and responsibility attribution for identified problems

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:

**Direct Responsibility Assignment**:
- "X is responsible for," "this stems from Y's actions," "the fault lies with," "caused by," "directly attributable to"
- "due to," "blame," "accountable for," "at fault," "this results from," "brought about by"
- "responsibility rests with," "culpability belongs to," "accountability lies with," "fault can be traced to"

**Systemic Causation**:
- "structural problems require," "the system creates," "institutional factors," "the roots of this problem"
- "systemic causes," "institutional responsibility," "structural attribution," "systematic factors," "organizational causes"
- "broader patterns," "underlying structures," "institutional framework," "systematic dysfunction," "structural analysis"

**Explanatory Frameworks**:
- "this happens because," "the mechanism involves," "causal chain includes," "explanatory model suggests"
- "contributing factors," "primary causes," "secondary influences," "underlying mechanisms," "causal dynamics"

### Moral Evaluation (0.0-1.0)
**Core Concept**: Communication that invokes values and ethical judgments to evaluate situations, actions, and actors

**Strategic Function**: Provides ethical framework for understanding problems and solutions, establishes moral stakes and value priorities

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:

**Value Invocation**:
- "justice demands," "fairness requires," "liberty is at stake," "fundamental rights," "core values"
- "moral imperative," "ethical obligation," "principle at stake," "values-based approach," "moral foundation"
- "democratic principles," "constitutional values," "human dignity," "equal treatment," "moral responsibility"

**Ethical Judgment Language**:
- "this is fundamentally wrong," "ethically unacceptable," "morally justified," "right thing to do"
- "moral evaluation," "ethical assessment," "value judgment," "moral consideration," "ethical standard"
- "morally bankrupt," "ethically sound," "principled approach," "moral clarity," "ethical imperative"

**Character Assessment**:
- "demonstrates integrity," "shows moral character," "reveals true values," "ethical leadership," "moral courage"
- "lack of principle," "moral failure," "ethical lapse," "character flaw," "values deficit"

### Treatment Recommendation (0.0-1.0)
**Core Concept**: Communication that proposes solutions and advocates for specific courses of action and policy responses

**Strategic Function**: Advocates for particular responses, establishes action priorities, and guides decision-making toward preferred outcomes

**Enhanced Linguistic Markers**:

**Direct Solution Advocacy**:
- "we must immediately," "the answer is," "the only way forward," "solution requires," "necessary action"
- "we should," "recommended approach," "best path forward," "optimal strategy," "preferred solution"
- "immediate steps," "urgent action," "decisive response," "comprehensive solution," "strategic approach"

**Policy Prescription**:
- "specific steps include," "concrete measures," "detailed implementation," "policy proposal," "legislative action"
- "regulatory response," "administrative measures," "institutional reform," "systematic changes," "structural solutions"
- "implementation plan," "action agenda," "policy framework," "strategic initiative," "intervention strategy"

**Action Prioritization**:
- "first priority," "immediate focus," "urgent agenda," "primary objective," "central goal"
- "sequential steps," "phased approach," "systematic implementation," "coordinated response," "integrated strategy"

## Strategic Communication Assessment

### Mathematical Specifications

**Message Completeness Score**: `(Number of functions with scores > 0.3) / 4`
- Range: 0.0 (no systematic framing) to 1.0 (complete strategic framing)
- Measures systematic versus ad hoc messaging patterns

**Function Independence Assessment**: Statistical analysis of function correlation patterns
- High independence: Functions vary separately based on strategic needs
- Low independence: Functions cluster together suggesting less sophisticated messaging

**Strategic Sophistication Index**: 
`(completeness_score * 0.4) + (independence_measure * 0.3) + (function_integration_quality * 0.3)`
- Range: 0.0 (reactive messaging) to 1.0 (strategic communication mastery)

### Communication Patterns

**Strategic Framing**: High completeness + high independence + systematic integration
**Partial Framing**: Moderate completeness + some independence + selective emphasis
**Reactive Messaging**: Low completeness + high correlation + ad hoc patterns
**Single-Function Focus**: High emphasis on one function + minimal others

### Frame Construction Analysis

**Complete Strategic Frame**: All four functions present with strategic emphasis patterns
**Problem-Solution Frame**: Strong problem definition + treatment recommendation focus
**Attribution Frame**: Emphasis on causal attribution + moral evaluation combination
**Agenda-Setting Frame**: Problem definition focus with minimal solution orientation
