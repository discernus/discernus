# Civic Virtue Framework v4.0

**Version**: v4.0  
**Status**: Active

A comprehensive framework for analyzing the civic and moral dimensions of political discourse, based on Aristotelian virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican theory. This framework evaluates how political communication either strengthens or weakens democratic civic life through the presence of civic virtues versus civic vices.

---

## Executive Summary

The Civic Virtue Framework examines political discourse through the lens of classical and contemporary civic theory, identifying ten key dimensions that shape democratic civic engagement. By distinguishing between civic virtues that strengthen democratic discourse and civic vices that undermine it, this framework provides insight into the moral health of political communication.

**Core Innovation**: Virtue-vice clustering system that separates discourse elements promoting civic engagement from those encouraging civic withdrawal, without forcing artificial balance requirements.

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Dual-Cluster Analysis**: Independent assessment of civic virtues and civic vices
- **Moral Hierarchy**: Recognition of primary, secondary, and tertiary civic dimensions
- **Democratic Health Assessment**: Evaluation of discourse impact on civic life
- **Rich Evidence Base**: Multiple quotations per dimension with confidence ratings
- **Competitive Dynamics**: Analysis of virtue-vice tensions within discourse

## Theoretical Foundation

### Classical Foundations

**Aristotelian Virtue Ethics**: Drawing from Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics*, particularly Book VI on intellectual virtues, this framework recognizes that character excellence in public life depends on the cultivation of specific virtues and the avoidance of corresponding vices.

**Civic Republican Theory**: Building on contemporary scholarship by Michael Sandel and others, this framework examines how political discourse either promotes genuine civic engagement or undermines it through appeals to narrow self-interest or factional loyalty.

### The Virtue-Vice Architecture

The framework organizes civic dimensions into two competing clusters:

**Civic Virtues (Integrative Anchors)**:
- Promote democratic participation and civic unity
- Strengthen social bonds and collective problem-solving
- Encourage constructive political engagement

**Civic Vices (Disintegrative Anchors)**:
- Undermine democratic institutions and civic trust
- Weaken social cohesion and community bonds
- Promote political withdrawal or destructive engagement

### Contemporary Validation

This approach is validated by social capital research (Robert Putnam) and democratic theory scholarship that demonstrates the connection between civic virtue cultivation and democratic health.

## Analytical Methodology

### Hierarchical Scoring

**Tier Weighting System**:
- **Primary** (1.0 weight): Core dimensions that fundamentally shape civic orientation
- **Secondary** (0.8 weight): Important supporting dimensions
- **Tertiary** (0.6 weight): Contextual dimensions that modify primary orientation

**Independent Assessment**: Each dimension scored 0.0 to 1.0 based on:
- **Frequency**: How often dimension-specific language appears
- **Centrality**: How central the dimension is to the text's argument
- **Sophistication**: How developed the virtue or vice expression is

### Competitive Pattern Analysis

**Virtue-Vice Competition**: Analysis of how civic virtues and vices compete within discourse:
- **Pure Virtue**: High virtue scores, low vice scores
- **Pure Vice**: High vice scores, low virtue scores
- **Mixed Discourse**: Presence of both virtue and vice elements
- **Moral Tension**: Evidence of internal conflict between virtue and vice appeals

### Democratic Health Assessment

**Civic Balance**: Net assessment of democratic strengthening versus weakening
**Moral Clarity**: Distinctness of virtue versus vice positioning
**Civic Intensity**: Overall strength of civic engagement (positive or negative)

---

## Academic Validation

### Primary Sources

- **Aristotle**: *Nicomachean Ethics*, Book VI - foundational virtue ethics
- **Alexis de Tocqueville**: *Democracy in America* - civic associations and democratic life
- **Robert Putnam**: *Bowling Alone* - social capital and civic engagement
- **Michael Sandel**: *What Money Can't Buy* - moral limits and civic values

### Contemporary Applications

This framework has been applied to analyze:
- Political campaign communications
- Legislative debate transcripts
- Public policy discourse
- Social media political content
- Democratic deliberation processes

### Empirical Validation

Framework dimensions demonstrate consistent relationships with:
- Democratic satisfaction measures
- Civic engagement indicators
- Social trust assessments
- Political participation rates

      "description": "Complete civic virtue analysis across all ten dimensions with hierarchical weighting",
      "analysis_prompt": "You are an expert analyst of civic life and democratic participation, with deep knowledge of civic republican theory, virtue ethics, and social capital research. Your approach is grounded in classical virtue ethics (Aristotle) and contemporary civic theory (Putnam, Sandel). Your task is to analyze the provided text using the Civic Virtue Framework. This framework examines how political discourse either strengthens or weakens democratic civic life through the presence of civic virtues versus civic vices. First, assess the overall civic orientation of the text as Virtue-Oriented, Vice-Oriented, Mixed, or Neutral. Then evaluate all ten civic dimensions organized in two clusters: CIVIC VIRTUES (that strengthen democratic discourse): Dignity (Primary, 1.0 weight): Individual moral worth and universal human dignity. Look for: 'human dignity', 'individual worth', 'respect for persons', 'human rights', 'inherent value', 'moral worth', 'personal dignity', 'universal dignity', 'human agency', 'individual respect'. Truth (Secondary, 0.8 weight): Factual accuracy and intellectual honesty. Look for: 'factual accuracy', 'intellectual honesty', 'evidence-based', 'truth-telling', 'honest discourse', 'accurate information', 'factual claims', 'empirical evidence', 'transparent reasoning', 'verifiable facts'. Justice (Secondary, 0.8 weight): Fairness, proportionality, and procedural equity. Look for: 'fairness', 'justice', 'equity', 'proportionality', 'fair treatment', 'just outcomes', 'procedural fairness', 'equal treatment', 'impartial', 'due process'. Hope (Tertiary, 0.6 weight): Constructive vision and democratic optimism. Look for: 'hope', 'optimism', 'positive vision', 'constructive future', 'democratic possibility', 'progress', 'improvement', 'better tomorrow', 'positive change', 'inspiring vision'. Pragmatism (Tertiary, 0.6 weight): Practical solutions and workable compromise. Look for: 'practical solutions', 'workable compromise', 'realistic approach', 'effective governance', 'pragmatic policy', 'feasible plans', 'common ground', 'practical wisdom', 'workable solutions', 'realistic goals'. CIVIC VICES (that weaken democratic discourse): Tribalism (Primary, 1.0 weight): Group loyalty over universal principles. Look for: 'us vs them', 'tribal loyalty', 'group superiority', 'in-group favoritism', 'out-group hostility', 'identity politics', 'group solidarity', 'tribal identity', 'partisan loyalty', 'group conflict'. Resentment (Secondary, 0.8 weight): Grievance, victimization, and blame. Look for: 'grievance', 'victimization', 'blame', 'resentment', 'past wrongs', 'historical injustice', 'victim mentality', 'grievance politics', 'assigning blame', 'dwelling on wrongs'. Manipulation (Secondary, 0.8 weight): Deceptive rhetoric and emotional exploitation. Look for: 'deceptive rhetoric', 'emotional manipulation', 'misleading information', 'propaganda', 'spin', 'distortion', 'emotional exploitation', 'false claims', 'manipulative language', 'deceptive framing'. Fear (Tertiary, 0.6 weight): Anxiety appeals and catastrophic thinking. Look for: 'fear appeals', 'catastrophic thinking', 'worst-case scenarios', 'anxiety-inducing', 'scary outcomes', 'disaster predictions', 'fear-mongering', 'panic-inducing', 'threatening language', 'doomsday scenarios'. Fantasy (Tertiary, 0.6 weight): Unrealistic expectations and magical thinking. Look for: 'unrealistic expectations', 'magical thinking', 'impossible solutions', 'utopian outcomes', 'wishful thinking', 'fantasy solutions', 'unrealistic promises', 'magical fixes', 'impossible goals', 'dreamlike scenarios'. For each dimension, follow this process: 1. Read the text systematically for dimension-specific language and concepts 2. Consider both explicit language and implicit appeals to virtue or vice 3. Score the dimension from 0.0 to 1.0 based on frequency, centrality, and sophistication, applying the hierarchical weighting (primary=1.0, secondary=0.8, tertiary=0.6) 4. Assess your confidence in the scoring based on evidence clarity and quantity 5. Provide approximately 2 direct quotations supporting each dimension score above 0.3 6. Identify any competitive dynamics between virtue and vice elements within the text. Remember: This framework analyzes civic health, not partisan politics. Score virtues and vices independently based on their presence in the discourse, regardless of political ideology."
