# Emotional Climate Framework (ECF) v1.0
## Pure Emotional Atmosphere Assessment

---

## What Is This Framework?

The Emotional Climate Framework (ECF) analyzes the emotional atmosphere created by political and social discourse, independent of rhetorical strategy, speaker character, or institutional effects. ECF reveals the psychological environment that discourse generates, focusing purely on emotional patterns and their intensity.

**Core Purpose**: ECF helps researchers understand the emotional climate of public discourse by measuring six fundamental emotional dimensions that shape how audiences experience and respond to political communication.

**Key Applications**:
- **Emotional Impact Assessment**: Measure psychological atmosphere of political messaging
- **Cross-Platform Comparison**: Compare emotional climates across different media and contexts
- **Longitudinal Climate Tracking**: Monitor emotional atmosphere changes over time
- **Audience Response Prediction**: Understand emotional foundations of political engagement

## How ECF Works

### Pure Emotional Assessment

ECF recognizes that discourse creates emotional environments that exist independently of other factors. The framework measures emotional climate without making judgments about rhetorical strategy, speaker morality, or institutional effects.

### Six Emotional Dimensions

**Affective Climate**:
- **Fear** (0.0-1.0): Crisis language, threat perception, vulnerability emphasis, anxiety appeals
- **Hope** (0.0-1.0): Opportunity language, progress emphasis, achievement focus, optimistic vision

**Relational Climate**:
- **Enmity** (0.0-1.0): Hostility language, aggressive terms, conflict emphasis, adversarial framing
- **Amity** (0.0-1.0): Friendship language, unity expressions, cooperation emphasis, collaborative framing

**Success Orientation Climate**:
- **Envy** (0.0-1.0): Resentment toward success, zero-sum thinking, status grievance, inequality focus
- **Compersion** (0.0-1.0): Celebration of others' success, merit recognition, abundance mindset, shared prosperity

### Independent Anchor Scoring

Unlike frameworks that force artificial balance, ECF recognizes that sophisticated discourse often contains multiple competing emotional elements simultaneously. Each dimension is scored independently from 0.0 to 1.0, preserving complete emotional information.

**Information Preservation**:
- High Fear + High Hope = Emotional Tension Pattern (not neutral)
- Low Fear + Low Hope = Emotional Disengagement Pattern (distinct from balance)
- High Enmity + High Amity = Emotional Complexity Pattern (mixed signals)

## Framework Dimensions

### Fear (Crisis/Threat Climate)

**Core Concept**: Language that emphasizes danger, threat, vulnerability, or crisis

**Key Indicators**:
- "emergency," "catastrophe," "under attack," "existential threat," "running out of time"
- "crisis," "collapse," "disaster," "danger," "vulnerable," "at risk"
- "threat," "menace," "peril," "jeopardy," "dire consequences"

**Emotional Function**: Creates urgency, anxiety, and defensive psychological orientation

### Hope (Opportunity/Progress Climate)

**Core Concept**: Language that emphasizes possibility, progress, achievement, or positive future

**Key Indicators**:
- "bright future," "breakthrough," "moving forward," "success," "opportunity"
- "progress," "achievement," "improvement," "better tomorrow," "positive change"
- "inspiring vision," "optimistic," "promising," "encouraging," "uplifting"

**Emotional Function**: Creates motivation, engagement, and forward-looking psychological orientation

### Enmity (Hostility/Conflict Climate)

**Core Concept**: Language that emphasizes hostility, aggression, or adversarial relationships

**Key Indicators**:
- "enemy," "destroy," "crush," "evil," "corrupt," "fight," "battle"
- "aggressive," "hostile," "attack," "assault," "combat," "warfare"
- Animal comparisons, dehumanization, "threat," "menace," "dangerous"

**Emotional Function**: Creates adversarial mindset, us-vs-them psychology, defensive aggression

### Amity (Friendship/Unity Climate)

**Core Concept**: Language that emphasizes friendship, cooperation, or collaborative relationships

**Key Indicators**:
- "friend," "ally," "together," "united," "love," "care," "respect"
- "partner," "colleague," "cooperation," "collaboration," "working together"
- "community," "solidarity," "brotherhood," "sisterhood," "fellowship"

**Emotional Function**: Creates collaborative mindset, social bonding, cooperative engagement

### Envy (Resentment/Grievance Climate)

**Core Concept**: Language that emphasizes unfair advantage, status resentment, or zero-sum competition

**Key Indicators**:
- "privileged elite," "didn't earn it," "rigged system," "taking our share"
- "unfair advantage," "lucky breaks," "undeserved," "handed everything"
- "wealth inequality," "status quo," "establishment privilege," "inherited wealth"

**Emotional Function**: Creates grievance psychology, status resentment, zero-sum mindset

### Compersion (Celebration/Merit Climate)

**Core Concept**: Language that celebrates others' success, recognizes merit, or emphasizes shared prosperity

**Key Indicators**:
- "well-deserved," "hard-earned," "impressive accomplishment," "everyone can win"
- "rising tide," "shared prosperity," "celebrate success," "merit recognition"
- "inspiring achievement," "earned through effort," "worthy of praise," "abundant opportunities"

**Emotional Function**: Creates positive-sum psychology, merit appreciation, shared celebration

## Emotional Climate Measurement

ECF provides mathematical indices that quantify discourse's emotional atmosphere:

**Affective Climate Index**: Measures overall emotional tone and intensity
**Relational Climate Index**: Assesses cooperative versus adversarial atmosphere
**Success Climate Index**: Evaluates competitive versus collaborative orientation toward achievement
**Overall Emotional Intensity**: Composite measure of emotional engagement level

These indices enable:
- Quantitative comparison across different texts, speakers, or time periods
- Emotional climate trend analysis for prediction and intervention
- Cross-platform emotional atmosphere comparison

## Theoretical Foundation

### Emotional Independence

ECF is built on the recognition that emotional climate operates independently of other discourse factors. The same emotional patterns can appear in different rhetorical strategies, from different moral characters, and with different institutional effects.

**Core Insight**: Emotional climate affects audience response regardless of speaker intent or discourse strategy.

### Affective Political Psychology

ECF draws on research in political psychology showing that emotional responses to political communication often override rational evaluation. Understanding emotional climate helps predict audience engagement, persuasion effects, and behavioral responses.

**Empirical Grounding**:
- **Affective Intelligence Theory**: How emotions guide political attention and learning
- **Social Identity Theory**: How emotional climate affects group membership and loyalty
- **Persuasion Research**: How emotional atmosphere influences message acceptance

### Information Preservation Innovation

Unlike traditional sentiment analysis that reduces complex emotional patterns to simple positive/negative scores, ECF preserves complete emotional information through independent dimension scoring.

**Methodological Advantage**: Captures emotional complexity and tension patterns that binary classifications miss.
