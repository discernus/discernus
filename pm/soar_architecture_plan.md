# SOAR: Simple Atomic Orchestration Research
## Scalable Research Execution System

**Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Status**: Strategic Plan - Pending Refinement  
**Philosophy**: THIN Software + LLM Intelligence  
**Objective**: Outperform manual chatbot operations through atomic scaling

**SOAR**: **S**imple **A**tomic **O**rchestration **R**esearch

---

## Strategic Vision

Create a SOAR architecture that enables researchers to:
1. **Point the system** to a project directory via CLI
2. **Validate everything** through LLM-powered quality gates
3. **Execute at scale** with dynamic agent orchestration
4. **Receive publication-ready results** with complete provenance

**Core Principle**: Same interaction simplicity as chatbot, but designed to scale atomically from 1 text to 1000+ texts with consistent quality.

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have ✅
- **Framework Specification Validation Rubric v1.0**: 263-line comprehensive validation specification
- **Experiment Specification Validation Rubric v1.0**: 348-line experiment validation specification
- **Framework Specification v3.2**: Advanced framework specification with validation requirements
- **Existing Orchestration System**: Complex but functional agent coordination
- **Quality Standards**: "You've done your homework" validation philosophy

### What We're Missing ❌
- **Project Structure Standards**: No defined project directory format
- **Validation Agent Implementation**: Rubrics exist but no agent uses them
- **CLI Interface**: No simple command-line entry point
- **Dynamic Orchestration**: Current system doesn't scale workers based on experiment complexity
- **Results Integration**: No systematic results collection and synthesis

## SOAR Architecture Overview

### **System Flow**
```
soar validate → soar execute → Results
     ↓              ↓
Project Validation → Orchestration Planning → Analysis Execution → 
Synthesis → Referee Validation → Final Report → Project Results Storage
```

### **THIN Principles Applied**
- **Minimal Software**: Only coordination, handoff logic, and file operations
- **LLM Intelligence**: All analysis, validation, and synthesis done by specialized agents
- **Simple Interface**: Single CLI command with project path
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any framework passing validation standards

## SOAR Agent Architecture

### **1. Validation Agent**
**Role**: Comprehensive project validation using existing rubrics
**Priming**: Framework Specification Validation Rubric v1.0 + Experiment Specification Validation Rubric v1.0
**Responsibilities**:
- Validate framework specification (85% completeness threshold)
- Validate experiment design (90% completeness threshold)
- Check corpus manifest completeness and coherence
- Identify any gaps or issues requiring resolution
- Generate validation report with pass/fail determination

**CLI Interaction Protocol**:
- Issues found → Interactive dialog with user for resolution
- All issues resolved → Request approval to proceed
- Approval granted → Handoff to orchestration agent

### **2. Orchestration Agent**
**Role**: Dynamic experiment execution planning
**Priming**: Experiment complexity assessment and resource optimization
**Responsibilities**:
- Analyze experiment scope and complexity
- Determine optimal worker count based on corpus size and analysis depth
- Generate analysis worker profiles with specific priming instructions
- Create orchestration plan with timeline and resource allocation
- Handoff worker profiles to experiment orchestrator

**Decision Logic**:
- Simple descriptive analysis: 1-5 workers
- Comparative analysis: 5-20 workers
- Complex multi-dimensional analysis: 20-50+ workers
- Consider text length, framework complexity, analysis depth

### **3. Analysis Worker Agents**
**Role**: Framework-guided text analysis
**Priming**: Framework specification + experiment methodology + assigned texts
**Responsibilities**:
- Apply framework scoring to assigned texts
- Generate qualitative evaluation with evidence citations
- Provide confidence assessments for all scores
- Log results with timestamps and metadata
- Self-terminate upon completion

**Output Format**:
```json
{
  "worker_id": "worker_001",
  "assigned_texts": ["text_001", "text_002"],
  "framework_scores": {
    "axis_1": {"score": 0.75, "confidence": 0.85, "evidence": "..."},
    "axis_2": {"score": 0.32, "confidence": 0.78, "evidence": "..."}
  },
  "qualitative_analysis": "...",
  "completion_timestamp": "2025-01-07T15:30:00Z"
}
```

### **4. Synthesis Agents**
**Role**: Master report generation from individual analyses
**Priming**: Experimental objectives + all worker results + synthesis methodology
**Responsibilities**:
- Aggregate and synthesize individual analysis results
- Identify patterns and trends across corpus
- Generate hypothesis testing conclusions
- Create publication-ready master report
- Engage in competitive validation with other synthesis agents

**Competitive Validation**: Deploy 2+ synthesis agents (different LLMs) to independently synthesize results, then present findings to referee agent.

### **5. Referee Agent**
**Role**: Final validation and quality control
**Priming**: Experimental standards + synthesis reports + validation criteria
**Responsibilities**:
- Evaluate competing synthesis reports
- Identify discrepancies and require resolution
- Validate conclusions against experimental objectives
- Approve final synthesis or require revision
- Generate final validation assessment

## SOAR Vision

**"Making world-class computational research as simple as pointing to a folder."**

SOAR transforms the computational research experience from complex orchestration to simple execution, while maintaining the highest standards of academic rigor and methodological sophistication.

**Research workflow with SOAR**:
1. `soar validate ./my_research_project` → Comprehensive validation with interactive issue resolution
2. `soar execute ./my_research_project` → Multi-agent analysis with real-time progress
3. Read publication-ready results in `./my_research_project/results/`

**The SOAR Promise**: Same simplicity as chatbot interaction, unlimited scaling potential, with academic-grade quality assurance.

## Next Steps

1. **Refine Architecture**: Review and refine this plan based on feedback
2. **Prioritize Features**: Determine minimum viable product scope
3. **Implementation Planning**: Detailed technical implementation plan
4. **Proof of Concept**: Simple demonstration with CFF framework
