# Research Content Planning

**Purpose**: Centralized planning for research activities conducted ON the Discernus platform (vs developing the platform itself).

**Scope**: Research studies, corpus development, academic publications, and content collection activities that use Discernus as a research tool.

**Usage**: 
- Plan and track research studies and content development
- Organize corpus collection and preparation activities
- Coordinate academic publication and outreach efforts
- Separate from platform development work (which goes in sprints.md)
