# Backlog Item: Implement `CritiqueAgent` for Adversarial Workflow

**Description**

The `CritiqueAgent` is an adversarial, role-playing agent whose sole purpose is to find flaws in the `synthesis_text` generated by the `SynthesisAgent`. It is prompted to act as a skeptical peer reviewer, looking for logical fallacies, missed evidence, alternative interpretations, and unsubstantiated claims.

**Rationale**

This agent is the core of the "adversarial" part of the synthesis workflow. By systematically challenging the initial synthesis, it helps to identify and address weaknesses before the final report is generated, leading to a more robust and defensible research output.

**Implementation Tasks**

*   [ ] Create a new agent class, `CritiqueAgent`, in `discernus/agents/critique_agent.py`.
*   [ ] The agent should take the `synthesis_text` and the original `analysis_results` from the `workflow_state` as input.
*   [ ] It should prompt an LLM to perform a critique of the synthesis. The prompt should encourage a skeptical, adversarial stance.
*   [ ] The `WorkflowOrchestrator` should be able to spawn multiple `CritiqueAgents` in parallel.
*   [ ] The agent's output should be a `critique_text` string, which gets added to a list of `critiques` in the `workflow_state`.
*   [ ] Add the new agent to `discernus/core/agent_registry.yaml`.
*   [ ] Create a unit test for the agent.

**Dependencies and Relationships**

*   **`SynthesisAgent`**: This agent depends on the `synthesis_text` produced by the `SynthesisAgent`.
*   **`RevisionAgent` / `RefereeAgent`**: The `critique_text` produced by this agent is the primary input for either the `RevisionAgent` (in a two-party review) or the `RefereeAgent` (in a three-party review).
*   This agent is the "adversarial" component of the peer review simulation.
