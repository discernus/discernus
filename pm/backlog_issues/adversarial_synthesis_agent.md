# Backlog Item: Implement `SynthesisAgent` for Adversarial Workflow

**Description**

As part of the adversarial synthesis workflow, the `SynthesisAgent` is a role-playing agent that consumes the raw output from all `AnalysisAgent` runs and generates a single, coherent synthesis of the findings. Its role is to identify the main themes, points of agreement, and points of disagreement across the different models and runs.

**Note**: This is distinct from the existing final-reporting `SynthesisAgent`. This version is a "thin" agent focused only on initial synthesis, not statistical analysis or final report generation.

**Rationale**

This agent creates the initial document that will be the subject of peer review by the `CritiqueAgent`. It is the first step in the adversarial process, providing the foundation for subsequent refinement.

**Implementation Tasks**

*   [ ] Create a new agent class, `SynthesisAgent` (or a more specific name like `AdversarialSynthesisAgent`), in a new file in `discernus/agents/`.
*   [ ] The agent should accept the `analysis_results` from the `workflow_state` as input.
*   [ ] It should prompt a powerful LLM to synthesize the results into a single markdown document.
*   [ ] The output should be the `synthesis_text` added back to the `workflow_state`.
*   [ ] Add the new agent to `discernus/core/agent_registry.yaml`.
*   [ ] Create a unit test for the agent.

**Dependencies and Relationships**

*   This is the **first agent** in the adversarial synthesis workflow.
*   **`CritiqueAgent`**: Depends on the `synthesis_text` generated by this agent.
*   This agent is a prerequisite for the entire adversarial peer review process.
