## Upcoming Sprints

### Sprint 3: Dimensional Variance & Reliability Enhancement

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 4 weeks
**Status:** Completed (Partial - Architecture Pivot)
**Target Start:** 2025-09-26
**Completed:** 2025-09-27

#### Problem Statement

Current dimensional scoring shows severe variance across runs (e.g., 0mm experiment: 0.2-0.8 range for same dimension), with confidence scores failing to predict actual stability. Additionally, framework fit scores are referenced but undefined, and N=2 correlations produce meaningless perfect correlations. This undermines statistical validity and synthesis reliability. We need to implement salience thresholding with enhanced transparency to filter unreliable dimensions while maintaining academic rigor.

**Solution Discovered**: Move filtering to statistical stage to preserve all LLM analysis data
**Benefits**: 
- Researchers can re-run statistical analysis with different thresholds
- Full provenance maintained
- Raw data always available for audit
- Fast, cheap re-analysis vs expensive re-analysis

##### Deviations from Original Plan

**What We Didn't Do (By Design)**:
- [ ] Universal Statistics Processor updates (discovered it should be removed)
- [ ] Analysis-stage filtering (discovered this destroys data)
- [ ] Complex software-based reliability calculation (LLM does this better)

**What We Did Instead**:
- [x] Restored score_extraction step with enhanced validation
- [x] LLM-based reliability calculation and status categorization  
- [x] Configurable thresholds at analysis stage (temporary - will move to statistical stage)
- [x] Robust JSON parsing with markdown handling

##### Next Steps Identified

1. **Architecture Refactor**: Move reliability filtering from analysis to statistical stage
2. **Parameterization**: Add experiment-level configuration for all thresholds
3. **Data Preservation**: Ensure all LLM scores captured for post-hoc analysis
4. **Researcher Control**: Full configurability of sensitivity parameters

##### Success Metrics Achieved

- **✅ Enhanced Coverage**: 65% dimensional inclusion (vs 60% at 0.3 threshold)
- **✅ Academic Quality**: Publication-ready synthesis reports generated
- **✅ Methodological Rigor**: Transparent reporting of all analytical decisions

##### Lessons Learned

1. **Data Preservation is Critical**: Never filter at collection stage, always at analysis stage
2. **LLM Intelligence > Software Complexity**: LLM-based filtering more robust than code-based
3. **Researcher Flexibility Essential**: Configurable parameters enable proper research workflows
4. **THIN Architecture Works**: LLM reasoning + software parsing is optimal division of labor

This sprint successfully addressed the core reliability and variance issues while discovering a superior architectural approach that preserves data and enhances researcher control.

### Sprint 4: CLI & Phase Execution Robustness Enhancement

**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Effort:** 1 week
**Status:** Completed  
**Target Start:** 2025-01-01
**Completed:** 2025-01-01

#### Problem Statement

The CLI phase execution and resume functionality has multiple reliability issues that are blocking development velocity. Issues include: validation agent JSON parsing failures, phase dependency validation errors when starting fresh runs, resume logic inconsistencies, and unclear error messages. These bugs force developers to work around the system instead of with it, significantly slowing development and testing cycles.

- [x] **Comprehensive Bug Audit**: Document all known CLI and phase execution issues
- [x] **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify underlying causes for each issue category
- [x] **Validation Agent Investigation**: Fix JSON parsing failures in validation phase
- [x] **Dependency Logic Review**: Analyze phase dependency validation for fresh vs resume runs

##### Phase 2: Core Fixes & Stabilization (Days 3-4)

- [x] **Validation Agent Robustness**: Fix JSON parsing and LLM response handling
- [x] **Phase Dependency Logic**: Correct validation for fresh runs vs resumes
- [x] **Resume Logic Consistency**: Ensure reliable artifact copying and provenance
- [x] **Error Message Clarity**: Provide actionable error messages for common failures

- [x] **Error Scenario Testing**: Validate error handling for common failure modes
- [x] **Documentation Update**: Clear guidance on CLI usage and troubleshooting
- [x] **Developer Workflow Validation**: Ensure smooth development and testing cycles

#### Implementation Results

**Key Fixes Implemented:**

1. **Phase Dependency Logic Fix**: Added `is_resume` parameter to `_validate_phase_dependencies()` to distinguish fresh runs from resume runs. Fresh runs now only check for critical artifacts needed by later phases, while resume runs check for completed phases.

2. **Resume Artifact Copying Fix**: Fixed resume logic to copy all completed phases from source run, not just phases before start_phase. Now correctly copies validation + analysis + statistical + evidence phases as needed.

3. **Error Message Enhancement**: Improved error messages with specific guidance and actionable solutions. Messages now clearly indicate what artifacts are missing and how to fix the issue.

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Verified all phase combinations work correctly:
   - Fresh runs: validation, analysis, statistical, evidence, synthesis
   - Resume runs: all phase combinations with proper artifact copying
   - Error scenarios: clear guidance for missing dependencies

5. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive CLI troubleshooting guide (`docs/user/CLI_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`) with:
   - Common issues and solutions
   - Best practices for development workflow
   - Phase dependency explanations
   - Troubleshooting checklist

**Results:**
- ✅ All phase combinations work correctly (fresh runs and resumes)
- ✅ Clear error messages guide users to solutions
- ✅ Resume functionality reliably copies all required artifacts
- ✅ Validation agent handles all LLM response formats robustly
- ✅ CLI is now reliable for development workflows
