### Sprint 11: Resume Functionality Enhancements (Post-Release)

**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** 2 days  
**Status:** Planning  
**Target Start:** 2025-01-25

#### Problem Statement

While the core resume functionality is now working reliably, there are several enhancements that would improve the user experience and provide additional robustness for edge cases. These enhancements are not critical for the v2.1 release but would be valuable for future development.

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] **Add Resume Validation**: Explicit validation that resume will work before copying artifacts
- [ ] **Improve Error Messages**: Clear guidance when resume is not possible and why
- [ ] **Add Resume Logging**: Enhanced logging to track resume operations and artifact copying

**Phase 2: Advanced Features (Day 2)**

- [ ] **Implement Safe Resume Mode**: Option to verify artifact integrity before resume
- [ ] **Fix Phase State Consistency**: Ensure phase state accurately reflects actual completion status
- [ ] **Resume Diagnostic Tool**: CLI command to validate if a run can be resumed
- [ ] **Resume Documentation**: User guide on resume functionality and troubleshooting

#### Technical Requirements

**Code Changes:**

- [ ] `discernus/core/phase_state.py`: Add per-document checkpoint support
- [ ] `discernus/cli.py`: Enhanced resume validation and error messages  
- [ ] `discernus/core/atomic_document_analysis.py`: Add document-level completion tracking
- [ ] `discernus/core/local_artifact_storage.py`: Add artifact integrity validation

**Testing:**

- [ ] `discernus/tests/test_resume_functionality.py`: Comprehensive resume test suite
- [ ] Test fixtures for interrupted runs with known good state
- [ ] Integration tests covering all phase boundaries

#### Deliverables

- [ ] **Resume Test Suite**: Automated tests covering all resume scenarios
- [ ] **Resume Diagnostic Tool**: CLI command to validate if a run can be resumed
- [ ] **Resume Documentation**: User guide on resume functionality and troubleshooting
- [ ] **Enhanced Error Messages**: Clear, actionable guidance for resume failures

#### Definition of Done
