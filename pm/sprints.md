## Upcoming Sprints

### Sprint 3: Dimensional Variance & Reliability Enhancement

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 4 weeks
**Status:** Completed (Partial - Architecture Pivot)
**Target Start:** 2025-09-26
**Completed:** 2025-09-27

#### Problem Statement

Current dimensional scoring shows severe variance across runs (e.g., 0mm experiment: 0.2-0.8 range for same dimension), with confidence scores failing to predict actual stability. Additionally, framework fit scores are referenced but undefined, and N=2 correlations produce meaningless perfect correlations. This undermines statistical validity and synthesis reliability.

- [ ] Complex software-based reliability calculation (LLM does this better)

**What We Did Instead**:
- [x] Restored score_extraction step with enhanced validation
- [x] LLM-based reliability calculation and status categorization  
- [x] Configurable thresholds at analysis stage (temporary - will move to statistical stage)

##### Lessons Learned

1. **Data Preservation is Critical**: Never filter at collection stage, always at analysis stage
2. **LLM Intelligence > Software Complexity**: LLM-based filtering more robust than code-based
3. **Researcher Flexibility Essential**: Configurable parameters enable proper research workflows

**Target Start:** 2025-01-01
**Completed:** 2025-01-01

#### Problem Statement

The CLI phase execution and resume functionality has multiple reliability issues that are blocking development velocity. Issues include: validation agent JSON parsing failures, phase dependency validation errors when starting fresh runs, resume logic inconsistencies, and unclear error messages. These bugs force developers to work around the system instead of with it, significantly slowing development and testing cycles.
