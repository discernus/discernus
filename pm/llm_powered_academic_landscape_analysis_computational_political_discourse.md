# Computational Political Discourse Analysis: Research Landscape and Strategic Opportunities

## Part 1: Characterization of Core Research Areas

### Populism, Nationalism, and Political Ideology

**Dominant Questions:** Recent studies ask how to **measure and compare ideological content** in political texts, such as detecting populist or nationalist rhetoric and its effects on politics. Researchers examine who uses populist language and **what causes or outcomes** are linked to it (e.g. democratic backsliding or mobilization). They also explore **ideological polarization** – how discourse divides along left-right or nationalist lines – and how concepts like “the people” vs “elites” are constructed in different contexts. Cross-national comparisons (including G20 countries) are increasingly common to see how these ideologies manifest across languages and cultures.

**Common Methods:** A variety of **computational text-analysis techniques** are used. Traditional approaches include hand-coding manifestos or speeches, but automation is on the rise. Researchers have used **dictionary-based** methods (keyword lists for populist terms) and **topic modeling** to find themes in texts. Network analyses map co-occurrence of ideas to reveal ideological schema. **Word embeddings** have been trained to capture semantic proximity of ideological concepts (e.g. how closely “immigrants” aligns with “enemy” in nationalist vs mainstream corpora). More recently, **supervised classifiers and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs)** are employed to identify populist language at scale. For example, Van der Veen *et al.* (2024) fine-tune transformer models to classify sentences as populist vs non-populist, achieving high accuracy and enabling large-scale identification of populist discourse. In sum, this area is characterized by a mix of content analysis techniques – from simple keyword counts to advanced machine learning – all aimed at quantifying ideological frames in text.

### Affect, Emotion, and Tone in Political Discourse

**Dominant Questions:** Scholars here investigate **how emotional language and tone shape political communication**. Key questions include how **sentiment (positive/negative tone)** and specific emotions (anger, fear, enthusiasm, etc.) are used by politicians or perceived by audiences, and how this affects polarization and decision-making. Researchers also ask whether politics is becoming more negative or “affectively polarized” over time, and how emotional appeals (e.g. populist outrage or empathetic solidarity) influence voter attitudes. Another focus is on **incivility and extreme tone** (hate speech, toxicity) in discourse, especially on social media, and its consequences for democracy.

**Common Methods:** The prevalent technique is **sentiment analysis**, often using off-the-shelf lexicons (e.g. LIWC or NRC emotion lexicons) to score texts’ positivity, negativity, or emotional valence. Many studies use **dictionary-based sentiment** approaches due to their ease, although they can be skewed or miss context. Others train **supervised machine learning classifiers** on annotated data to detect emotions or tone (e.g. classifying a speech as angry, fearful, optimistic). Recently, **deep learning** has entered this domain: researchers leverage transformer-based models (BERT, etc.) for more nuanced sentiment detection, including multilingual settings. For example, **ParlaSent** (Mochtak *et al.*, 2024) introduced a multilingual transformer model fine-tuned on parliamentary debates in 7 languages, enabling sentiment analysis beyond English with high accuracy. Such advances address the prior limitation that non-English political sentiment was rarely analyzed computationally. In addition to textual sentiment, some work incorporates **tone measures** like linguistic complexity or emotional intensity (e.g. counting exclamation marks or emotion-laden words) to quantify rhetoric style. Overall, affective analysis in political texts blends lexicon approaches for quick insights with increasingly sophisticated ML/AI models for deeper, language-sensitive detection of emotion and tone.

### Disinformation, Propaganda, and Media Framing

**Dominant Questions:** This area covers how political actors **manipulate information and narratives**, with two major threads: **disinformation/propaganda** and **issue framing**. In the disinformation realm, researchers ask how to **detect “fake news” and propaganda content**, what characteristics such content has, and how it spreads through networks. For example, studies examine coordinated propaganda campaigns on social media and their impact on public opinion. Questions of interest include: how effective are various tactics (bots, micro-targeting) and how to algorithmically identify them? On the framing side, scholars investigate **how media or elites frame issues** (e.g. immigration as an economic vs. security issue) and how those frames bias understanding. Key questions include what frames dominate a given debate, how competing frames (e.g. “public health vs. personal freedom” in a pandemic) gain traction, and how framing influences audiences.

**Common Methods:** **Text classification** is central for disinformation studies – researchers build NLP models (often using neural networks or ensemble ML) to distinguish false or propagandistic statements from factual news. These models range from simple logistic regression on linguistic features to fine-tuned BERT-like models for high accuracy detection of fake news. There is also an emphasis on **network analysis** alongside text: for example, identifying bot networks or coordinated account behavior complements textual cues. Surveys of computational propaganda detection call for combining NLP (content-based detection of deceptive language or known propaganda “techniques”) with social network features (message amplification patterns). In media framing research, methods have included **manual coding schemes** (small-scale content analysis by humans) and **topic modeling or clustering** to discover latent frames in large corpora. More recently, supervised learning has been used when training data for specific frame categories exists (e.g. classifying news articles into frame types like economic vs. moral frame). However, framing detection by AI is still considered challenging; a 2024 review notes that **most framing analyses remain manual or case-specific, and NLP models capture only fragments of framing** rather than the full nuanced schema. In summary, disinformation research leverages advanced computational methods (often borrowing from machine learning and network science), while automated framing analysis is nascent – employing text mining techniques but still striving to match the depth of traditional framing theory.

### Methodological Advances and Comparisons

**Dominant Questions:** Here the focus is on the **comparison and validity of text analysis techniques** in political research. Scholars ask: How do different approaches (dictionary-based, statistical, machine learning, now LLM-based) perform relative to each other? What are their **trade-offs in accuracy, interpretability, and required data**? A key question is how to ensure that computational measures truly capture the theoretical concepts of interest (e.g. “nationalist sentiment” or “policy frames”) – in other words, concerns of **conceptual validity** and bias in automated text measures. Researchers also examine issues like **cross-language applicability** of methods, given the dominance of English tools. Finally, a forward-looking question is how new AI language models (transformers, etc.) can augment or replace older techniques, and how to integrate domain knowledge into these models.

**Common Findings/Methods:** Comparative methodological studies often conduct **benchmark experiments**: e.g. applying a dictionary vs. a supervised ML model on the same annotated corpus to see which predicts human-coded labels better. One consistent finding is that **supervised ML (when enough training data is available) usually outperforms simple dictionaries in classification tasks** (such as detecting sentiment tone). However, dictionaries and lexicons remain useful, especially to cover edge cases or for interpretability, and **hybrid approaches** are recommended. Recent papers encourage combining human domain knowledge (e.g. creating custom dictionaries informed by word embeddings) with machine learning – this can improve performance under data-scarce conditions. Methodologists have also identified structural **gaps in current approaches**. For example, Baden *et al.* (2022) highlight that many computational text analyses prioritize technical novelty over accurate representation of social-scientific concepts, and often focus on single content dimensions rather than the complex, multi-faceted nature of political texts. They also note an **English-language bias** – tools for languages other than English lag behind, limiting truly comparative research. In response, the field is moving toward more **validity-focused, theory-informed methods**: using techniques like topic models or LLMs but guided by explicit theoretical frameworks, and developing multilingual resources. The overall trend in this area is a **reflection on best practices**: acknowledging no one method is perfect and that careful integration of **theory + advanced AI** is needed for the next generation of political discourse analysis.

## Part 2: "White Space" Analysis (Under-Researched Opportunities)

Below we identify three promising “white space” areas – research questions or domains that are currently under-explored – and explain why they have seen limited attention. For each, we propose a concrete question and discuss why our unique framework (with its theory-driven, multi-dimensional approach) is ideally suited to tackle it.

### White Space 1: **Multi-Dimensional Ideological Competition**

* **Under-Researched Domain:** Most studies analyze one ideology or dimension at a time (e.g. measuring populism alone, or left-right position in isolation). Little work examines **how multiple ideological themes interact** *within* the same discourse. In real political texts, concepts like nationalism, populism, and economic ideology can **co-occur and compete for emphasis**, but computational models often treat them independently. This interplay – for instance, a party mixing nationalist and populist appeals – is under-studied because it’s challenging to measure overlapping ideas with standard one-dimensional methods.
* **Why Under-Researched:** Traditional content analysis methods and many ML classifiers assume categories or latent topics are independent. They lack a framework to capture **ideological tension or trade-offs** when multiple ideas vie for “discursive space.” As a result, researchers have seldom quantified phenomena like **dilution effects** (when emphasizing one idea softens another). There is a recognized gap here: Baden *et al.* note a *“mismatch between \[text analysis] focus on specific contents and social scientists’ need for measuring multiple, often complex contents in the text.”*. In short, earlier tools weren’t built to handle *simultaneous, orthogonal dimensions*, so this area remained theoretical rather than empirical.
* **Proposed Research Question:** *Do political leaders dilute their core economic messages when they adopt populist-nationalist rhetoric simultaneously?* For example, **if a speech tries to champion both anti-elite populism and pro-market ideology, does one narrative crowd out the other?** This question probes how combining ideologies might create trade-offs in emphasis or clarity.
* **Why Our Methodology Is Uniquely Suited:** Our framework explicitly supports **theory-driven, orthogonal axes** for content, allowing us to map texts onto multiple dimensions without conflating them. *“Axes define bipolar relationships between exactly two anchor components... This constraint ensures clear interpretation, mathematical soundness, and statistical validity,”* according to our v3.2 specification. By coding texts on, say, a Populism↔Pluralism axis *and* an Economic Left↔Right axis, we can detect when a high score on one coincides with a low score on the other – evidence of competition or trade-off. Moreover, our **Competitive Dynamics Modeling** is designed to *“identify instances where multiple theoretical concepts compete for discursive space, creating dilution effects or semantic crowding”*. This lets us quantify how much attention to one idea might suppress another within the same document or speech. No existing approach offers this kind of integrated multi-axis analysis with built-in checks for interaction effects.
* **Key Reference (Gap Illustration):** As a point of contrast, **Müller & Freudenthaler (2022)** used topic modeling to find themes of populism in party communication, but such unsupervised topics can’t easily distinguish when two themes coincide or interfere. Our method, grounded in theory, would fill this white space by systematically mapping and **measuring ideological multi-dimensionality**, something only hinted at in prior work.

### White Space 2: **Relational Framing – Enmity vs. Amity**

* **Under-Researched Domain:** Political discourse often positions groups in relational terms: some messages **identify enemies and create an “us vs. them”** mentality (enmity framing), while others emphasize **solidarity, alliance, and common ground** (amity framing). We currently lack robust analysis of this *relational orientation* as a variable. Research on populism and extreme rhetoric has documented demonization of out-groups (e.g. immigrants as threats, opponents as “evil”), but there is little quantitative work treating *friend-versus-foe framing* as a spectrum that can be tracked across texts or over time. Similarly, while social movement studies discuss frames of solidarity, computational analysis rarely measures how much a speech focuses on uniting people versus dividing.
* **Why Under-Researched:** Detecting **“enmity framing” vs “amity framing”** requires understanding context and subtle cues (who is blamed or praised) that go beyond simple sentiment or topic. Until recently, NLP had difficulty parsing such relational nuance at scale. Scholars have mostly approached this via qualitative analysis or case studies (e.g. manually coding whether tweets target an enemy). Moreover, no standard dictionary or off-the-shelf model exists for “enemy images” or “ally images,” making it a custom, theory-intensive task – one that data-driven approaches tended to avoid. The result is a gap: discourse analyses acknowledge friend/enemy distinctions in theory but seldom quantify them empirically across large corpora.
* **Proposed Research Question:** *How does the balance of “enemy‐focused” vs “ally‐focused” rhetoric shift during election campaigns or crises?* For instance, **does a leader resort to more enemy-framing (blaming out-groups) as political competition intensifies, and revert to solidarity language when seeking coalition support?** This question would unveil dynamic changes in relational framing strategy under different conditions.
* **Why Our Methodology Is Uniquely Suited:** Our approach was built to explore exactly such relational orientations. In fact, we are *“developing capabilities to analyze the relational orientation of discourse—asking whether it is primarily focused on identifying enemies (‘enmity framing’) or building common ground (‘amity framing’)”*. Because we separately parameterize *how* actors or groups are portrayed, we can add a dedicated axis for Enmity↔Amity without conflating it with ideology or sentiment. Our **framework’s separation of style from content** means we can capture an aggressive versus conciliatory *tone toward groups*, independent of the policy content. Moreover, our system can leverage **anchors** (for example, references to “traitors” or “brothers”) to systematically score texts on enmity/amity. This is a novel application: existing sentiment analysis might catch negativity, but not *who* that negativity is directed at. By contrast, our theory-guided model can be instructed to detect when discourse “others” a group vs. when it uses inclusive language – providing a quantifiable measure of political friend-enemy framing that others haven’t produced.
* **Adjacent Work (Gap Illustration):** A recent study by Cervi *et al.* (2023) qualitatively identified how populist leaders frame opponents as “enemies of the people”. However, it stopped at describing strategies in two cases. Our method could take this further by **measuring such enmity framing across many actors and over time**, filling a clear white space with a generalized, scalable analysis of relational framing.

### White Space 3: **Separation of Rhetorical Style from Ideological Content**

* **Under-Researched Domain:** In political text analysis, **what is said (content)** often gets all the attention, while **how it is said (style)** is glossed over or entangled with content. There is a paucity of research that treats *rhetorical style as a distinct analyzable element* across large corpora. For example, two speeches might both advocate nationalist policies (same content) but one does so with fiery, emotional language and the other in dry, technocratic terms – a crucial difference that standard topic or sentiment models would only partially catch. Studies of style exist (e.g. work on civility, use of metaphors, reading grade level of speeches), but these tend to be separate from content studies. The **independent effect of style on political persuasion or polarization** remains under-explored in a systematic way, especially combining with content: e.g., are emotional appeals more effective for certain ideologies? This kind of question lives in a white space between rhetoric and content analysis.
* **Why Under-Researched:** Traditionally, content analysis and stylistic analysis have been siloed. Many computational models collapse style into content – for instance, a sentiment model will label a sentence “negative” but not explain if it’s negative due to ideological attack or just harsh tone. Meanwhile, stylistic metrics (like lexical complexity or speech speed in transcripts) were often examined in isolation by linguists, without linking back to *what* was being said. This is partly a tooling issue: previous NLP pipelines weren’t designed to output multi-dimensional annotations (topic + tone + complexity all separately). Additionally, it requires interdisciplinary insight (linguistics and political science), so few projects attempted it. The result is a gap in understanding: we know little about, say, **when politicians amp up emotional style regardless of content** or how **stylistic intensity correlates with ideological extremity**.
* **Proposed Research Question:** *Do political figures change their rhetorical style (e.g. emotional intensity or simplicity of language) when shifting between different ideological messages?* For instance, **does a leader use more emotive, populist styling when talking about national identity, but a calmer, technical style when discussing economics – and what happens when these issues merge?** This question probes the interaction of style and content: something under-studied but vital to communication strategy.
* **Why Our Methodology Is Uniquely Suited:** Our framework explicitly **treats style and content as separable layers** of analysis. As noted in our specification, *“it focuses on the ‘how’ of the message, not just the ‘what’.”* We can thus analyze a corpus on two tracks: one mapping the ideological content via our axes, and another assessing style variables (e.g. sentiment strength, rhetorical devices, formality). Because these are built into our model as independent components, we can ask complex questions like the one above by correlating style metrics with positions on content axes. This is **precisely the kind of analysis our hybrid approach enables** that others cannot: most NLP models would require either two separate analyses or risk confounding the two (for example, a topic model might interpret extreme emotional words as a topic instead of a style). Our approach can detect, say, a **surge of emotional rhetoric (“high-arousal” style)** and determine if it’s happening *independent of ideological shift* or as an intensifier for a specific idea – providing insights into whether style is a deliberate strategy. By cleanly isolating style, we also open the door to studying its effects (like measuring if high-emotion style correlates with more audience engagement, controlling for content). This white space lies at the intersection of political communication and computational linguistics, and our method is uniquely equipped to illuminate it.
* **Adjacent Work (Gap Illustration):** Classic studies like Mosteller & Wallace (1963) showed the power of focusing on function-word style to identify authorship (separating *how* something is written from *what* is written). In political science, however, such separation is rare. Our approach would update this insight for modern political discourse, **systematically disentangling style from substance** to answer questions others have not been able to ask at scale.

*(Additional Note: Beyond the three detailed above, other white spaces we identified include **temporal acceleration of discourse change** – few studies measure not just change but the *rate* of change in rhetoric – and **cross-language comparative discourse** – many languages remain understudied. Our methodology’s emphasis on temporal dynamics and multilingual adaptability (via pre-trained LLMs) positions us well to explore those as well.)*

## Part 3: "Competitive Zone" Analysis (Crowded Research Areas)

We now turn to areas where there is already a **high volume of research** – “competitive zones” – and discuss how our novel approach can add distinctive value. For each well-trodden domain, we describe the state-of-the-art and then outline how our methodology could **challenge or enhance the existing approaches**, offering a new layer of insight that sets us apart. We also propose a research question to showcase this advantage, along with key references representing the state of the art.

### Competitive Zone 1: **Sentiment and Emotional Tone Analysis**

* **Well-Researched Domain:** Analyzing sentiment, affect, and tone in political communication is a very crowded field. Researchers have extensively studied **sentiment in tweets, speeches, and news**, asking how positive or negative language correlates with political events, popularity, or polarization. There is also a rich literature on **emotion detection** – identifying expressions of anger, fear, joy in political text – which ties into theories of affective polarization and campaign strategies. The dominant approach historically was dictionary-based sentiment analysis (e.g. using sentiment lexicons to score texts), and many political studies employed tools like LIWC or tailored lexica for political sentiment. In recent years, **machine learning and deep learning models** have become state-of-the-art: researchers train classifiers on annotated data or use fine-tuned transformer models to detect sentiment with high accuracy. For example, **multilingual BERT models have been fine-tuned for parliamentary speech sentiment** in multiple countries, and tools like **ParlaSent** provide off-the-shelf models for sentiment in several languages. This evolution means current state-of-the-art sentiment analysis in politics is quite advanced, able to handle domain-specific vocabulary and even perform across languages. In short, the question “what is the emotional tone of this message/politician?” can now be answered reasonably well by existing methods, as evidenced by numerous studies and competitions producing models with strong performance.
* **Our Unique Value Proposition:** Despite the maturity of sentiment analysis, our methodology offers a **new explanatory layer** that others lack: the ability to link emotional tone with *ideological content and strategy*. Existing methods output a sentiment score or emotion category, but they do not explain *why* that tone is used or how it interacts with the message’s substance. Our framework can fill this gap by analyzing sentiment **in context of theoretical axes and relational framing**. For example, we can distinguish whether negative tone is part of an “enmity frame” (attacking an out-group) or part of a lament about policy, which traditional sentiment tools cannot do. We also separate **style from content** by design – so we can identify cases where two parties talk about the same issue but one does so in a far more emotional manner. This allows us to challenge the existing approaches on their own turf: rather than just providing a sentiment label, we can explain *the role of sentiment*. Moreover, our **temporal analysis** capability means we can detect not just static sentiment levels but changes and surges in emotional tone (e.g. a sudden spike in anger in debates) and tie those to events or ideological shifts, something off-the-shelf models won’t automatically do. By integrating sentiment with our multi-dimensional model, we essentially *add a new dimension to sentiment analysis*: turning it from a blunt measure into a nuanced indicator of rhetorical strategy.
* **Showcase Research Question:** *What new insights emerge when we map emotional tone onto our ideological and relational axes?* For instance, **do nationalist speeches that emphasize “us vs. them” framing also exhibit more extreme negative sentiment than those stressing unity?** We could take a well-studied phenomenon – say, angry rhetoric on immigration – and show how our method differentiates whether that anger is aimed at out-groups (enmity) or is a general grievance, and how it correlates with specific ideological positioning (e.g. far-right nationalism) over time. This question would directly showcase how we build on the crowded sentiment domain: we don’t just measure tone, we contextualize it in ideological space, providing explanations that pure sentiment scores alone cannot.
* **Key State-of-the-Art Citations:** The **ParlaSent project** is an excellent example of current advances – it developed a multilingual transformer model for political sentiment, greatly improving accuracy across languages. Another notable reference is **Rauh (2018)**, who highlighted the challenges of applying sentiment dictionaries to political texts and motivated more robust approaches for non-English contexts. These works represent the cutting edge we would “compete” with. Our added value is not in beating their accuracy, but in augmenting such tools: after obtaining sentiment from a model like ParlaSent, our framework could explain that, say, *high negativity in Party X’s statements is specifically tied to their use of enemy-driven framing* – a multi-layered insight beyond the reach of conventional sentiment analysis.

### Competitive Zone 2: **Disinformation and Propaganda Detection**

* **Well-Researched Domain:** Identifying and combating false or misleading political content has become a major research industry in the past decade. **Computational propaganda detection** is thoroughly studied, with numerous papers and even survey articles summarizing the state of the art. Researchers have developed a variety of models to detect fake news, misinformative narratives, or propagandistic language in texts. Current state-of-the-art approaches often use **ensemble techniques**: for example, combining NLP classifiers (to catch linguistic cues of deception or propaganda techniques like loaded language) with **network features** (to see if a piece of content is being pushed by coordinated accounts). There have been shared tasks (e.g. SemEval competitions) on propaganda technique detection, yielding high-performing models that can pinpoint specific rhetorical tactics (like appeal to fear, name-calling, etc.). In short, the field is crowded and competitive: new deep learning architectures (from BERT-based classifiers to multimodal models that analyze images+text in fake news) are constantly being tested. The dominant question – “Is this news or message misleading or propagandistic?” – can now be answered with reasonably high accuracy by specialized models, especially in high-resource languages. The **2020 survey by Da San Martino *et al.***, for example, reviews dozens of methods and emphasizes combining text and network analysis as the frontier for propaganda detection. This indicates how mature and saturated this area is, with incremental improvements still being pursued.
* **Our Unique Value Proposition:** Our methodology approaches misinformation from a **different angle: interpretative and theory-driven**, rather than purely predictive. Where existing models act as fairly black-box classifiers (“this tweet is propaganda: 1/0”), our framework could provide a *richer diagnosis* of a propagandistic message. For example, we can map a piece of disinformation on our ideological axes to see **what narrative it’s leveraging** – is it framing a public health issue on a liberty-vs-security axis? Is it using populist anti-elite rhetoric? – and on relational framing (is it demonizing a group as responsible?). This yields insight into the *content and framing strategy of propaganda*, not just its presence. Competing approaches rarely offer this, focusing instead on accuracy of detection. Moreover, our system’s ability to **separate style from content** is crucial here: propaganda often uses extreme emotional style (alarmism, fear appeals) combined with specific framing. We can disentangle those elements and potentially improve detection or at least characterization. In a “competitive zone” where many are trying to build a better classifier, we offer a complementary advantage: **explainability and theoretical context**. We could, for instance, refine understanding of how different ideological audiences are targeted by different misinformation narratives (something our multi-axis mapping can show, by comparing which axes various fake news items hit). This kind of nuanced, theory-backed analysis would allow us to *outperform others not necessarily in raw accuracy, but in the depth of analysis and insight for policymakers*.
* **Showcase Research Question:** *How do different strains of political disinformation map onto ideological and relational dimensions, and what does that reveal about their persuasive strategy?* Concretely, **are COVID-19 conspiracy narratives that appeal to nationalistic ideas (“China created the virus”) using more “enemy” framing and authoritarian populist rhetoric, whereas vaccine misinformation appealing to personal freedom uses libertarian framing and anger at elites?** Answering this would demonstrate how our approach distinguishes multiple “flavors” of propaganda that traditional models might all label simply as false. It shows we can not only flag misinformation but tell **which theoretical narrative it exploits and how**. This is a novel contribution in a crowded field: adding a layer of understanding about *why* certain fake news resonates (by linking it to axes like authoritarianism, populism, etc.).
* **Key State-of-the-Art Citations:** The **survey by Da San Martino *et al.* (2020)** encapsulates the state of this field, highlighting the combination of NLP and network analysis in propaganda detection. Another representative work is **Nakov *et al.* (2021)** on detecting propaganda techniques in news articles, which used BERT-based models to identify specific rhetorical techniques. These works reflect a focus on classification performance and fine-grained features. By engaging with them, we position our method as an enhancer: for instance, after using a model like Nakov’s to flag a sentence as “propaganda – loaded language,” our system could further interpret that sentence’s ideological thrust (perhaps it scored high on a nationalism axis and enmity framing). Thus, we stand on the shoulders of these state-of-art approaches but offer a **distinctive interpretive boost**, marrying their technical prowess with our theoretical lens.

### Competitive Zone 3: **Ideological and Issue Framing Classification**

* **Well-Researched Domain:** There is a long history of research trying to automatically categorize political texts by ideology, issue positions, or frames. From early **content analysis of party manifestos** (e.g. Wordscores and other scaling methods) to modern **ideology classifiers** using machine learning, the quest to map text to political positions is robust. Currently, state-of-the-art methods include **supervised classifiers trained on labeled data** – for example, classifying tweets or speeches as left vs right, or as populist vs non-populist, etc. We see numerous studies fine-tuning language models to detect ideological leanings or specific frames. The recent work by Van der Veen *et al.* (2024) we discussed is one such example in the populism domain: they fine-tuned a transformer and achieved \~84–92% accuracy in classifying U.S. governors’ speeches for populist content. Similarly, others have fine-tuned models to identify issue frames in text (e.g. labeling a climate change article as having an economic vs. public health frame). The **Media Frames Corpus** and derived models, for instance, use supervised learning to label news articles with predefined frame categories. In ideological classification, studies have moved beyond simple left/right – some attempt multi-class or dimensional predictions (libertarian-authoritarian, etc.), often using embeddings or multitask networks. Overall, this domain is “crowded” with approaches ranging from lexicon-based (e.g. dictionaries for hate speech ideology) to cutting-edge LLMs, all competing to better capture the **semantic cues of ideology or frame** in text. It’s a mature area with benchmark datasets (like manifestos, parliamentary debates, social media corpora with human-coded labels) and ongoing incremental improvements in accuracy.
* **Our Unique Value Proposition:** Our methodology offers a paradigm shift from the typical one-dimensional or single-category classification. **Instead of just labeling a text with an ideology or frame, we position it in a continuous, multi-dimensional ideological space.** This means we can capture subtleties that binary classifiers miss – for example, a speech might be economically leftist but culturally conservative; existing classifiers might struggle if those co-occur, whereas our axes would represent both. This gives us an edge in *refining and outperforming existing approaches in explanatory power*. We can also handle **ideological nuance over time**: rather than just saying “this leader is populist or not” in a static way, we can track how their discourse moves in our coordinate system month by month. This dynamic, granular view is largely absent in the current state of the art, which tends to do snapshot classification. Moreover, our approach inherently addresses one big challenge noted in the literature: the need for validity and theoretical grounding. By building the ideology measurement on explicit theoretical axes (like our anchor-based bipolar scales), we reduce the risk of the model picking up spurious correlations (a common problem in purely data-driven classifiers, as Jankowski & Huber (2023) noted in critique of a manifesto-based populism classifier). In a competitive field, our **hybrid approach (theory + AI)** can actually *outperform in terms of insight*: we might sacrifice a bit of predictive accuracy (though our use of strong LLM baselines mitigates that), but we gain immensely in interpretability and the ability to answer *why* a text is classified a certain way.
* **Showcase Research Question:** *Can our multi-axis model reveal patterns of ideological positioning that are obscured by traditional single-axis classifiers?* For example, **when analyzing legislative speeches, can we identify legislators who are economically progressive yet rhetorically populist, a combination that single-label models would misclassify?** This question would let us demonstrate our edge by picking a scenario where one-dimensional models fall short. We could show that our method places such a legislator accurately (high on economic-left axis, high on populist-people vs elite axis, perhaps moderate on other dimensions) and captures their profile more completely. By answering this, we directly challenge the competitive landscape: proving that our richer modeling can *refine or correct* the oversimplifications of the state-of-art classifiers. Another question: **How do issue frames (e.g. climate change framed as security threat vs economic opportunity) correlate with ideological axes in parliamentary debates?** – something our model can answer by simultaneously scoring texts on frame indicators and ideology, whereas typical frame classifiers output categories without ideological context.
* **Key State-of-the-Art Citations:** Van der Veen *et al.* (2024) exemplifies the cutting edge in automated populist discourse classification, using fine-tuned LLMs to greatly expand populism measurement. They, along with others (e.g. **Erhard *et al.* 2023** on sentence-level populism detection), show the power of modern NLP in this domain. Another state-of-art reference is **Müeller & Scheffer (2022)** who applied topic modeling and embedding techniques to detect latent frames and ideologies in text. These works represent high-performing, sophisticated approaches. Our strategy isn’t to beat their precision per se, but to **provide a more nuanced mapping**. By situating texts in a theory-informed multi-dimensional space, we can complement and surpass these models in terms of the questions we can answer. In essence, while they give us *labels*, we give a *map* – one that can reveal white spots and overlaps that labels alone hide. This is our competitive differentiation: turning the wealth of existing classification outputs into deeper insights by using our unique framework.
