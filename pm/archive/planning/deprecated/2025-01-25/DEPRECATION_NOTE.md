# Deprecation Notice: Stage 6 Notebook Automation Architecture

**Date:** January 25, 2025  
**Reason:** Strategic pivot to universal template approach  
**Status:** DEPRECATED - Do not implement

## Why This Approach Was Abandoned

### **Fundamental Design Flaws**
1. **Over-Engineering**: 306-line architecture for what should be simple templates
2. **Base64 Garbage**: Pre-generated notebooks with embedded images create unreadable output
3. **Against Standard Library Philosophy**: Complex abstractions vs. simple, proven tools
4. **Academic Anti-Pattern**: Pre-executed notebooks break researcher control and transparency

### **Strategic Misalignment**
- **Violates "Sarah Experience" Principles**: Goes against proven standard library approach
- **Creates Maintenance Burden**: Complex template system vs. simple, adaptable templates
- **Poor Academic Fit**: Researchers want to execute code naturally, not view pre-generated outputs

## Replacement Strategy: Universal Templates

### **New Approach (APPROVED)**
- **Simple Templates**: Clean, executable notebooks that adapt to any spec-validated experiment
- **User Execution**: Researchers run cells naturally, Jupyter handles display
- **Standard Libraries**: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas - no custom abstractions
- **Self-Loading**: Templates intelligently load experiment data and adapt to framework structure

### **Key Benefits**
- ✅ **Academic Trust**: Transparent, executable code researchers can understand and modify
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Simple templates instead of complex generation system
- ✅ **Flexible**: Users can adapt and extend templates for their specific needs
- ✅ **Reliable**: Standard library foundation eliminates custom bugs

**This architecture represents the "inconceivable bugginess" that the Sarah experience explicitly warns against.**
