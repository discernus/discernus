# 01: Validation Plan & Gate-Driven Methodology

**Status:** Current Plan  
**Strategic Alignment:** This plan directly executes the "Community Foundation & Adoption" phase of the `discernus_comprehensive_strategy.md`.

## The Core Principle: Validate Before Investing

Our development process is anchored by a **validation-first** philosophy. Before making significant investments in platform features or infrastructure, we must prove the core value and technical feasibility of our approach through a series of rigorous, sequential gates. This ensures we build something researchers actually want and need, not something we think they should want.

This approach provides several key benefits:
- **Evidence-Based Decisions:** Prevents major investment without proven research value.
- **Risk Management:** Creates multiple "off-ramps" to prevent sunk cost fallacy.
- **Academic Credibility:** Forces honest, transparent documentation of limitations.
- **Resource Protection:** Focuses effort and capital only on validated capabilities.

## The Five Validation Gates

Our entire initial development plan is structured around answering five fundamental questions. Each must be answered successfully before proceeding to the next.

### **Gate 1: Basic Capability Validation**
-   **Question**: Can LLMs + Discernus Coordinate System (DCS) replicate existing, peer-reviewed research with a reasonable degree of accuracy?
-   **Success Criteria**: Achieve a correlation of r > 0.70 with the manual coding from a known academic study (e.g., Tamaki & Fuks 2018).
-   **Failure Response**: The core premise of using LLMs for this task is flawed. Pivot or terminate the project.

### **Gate 2: Extension & Innovation Validation**
-   **Question**: Can the LLM+DCS approach extend and improve upon existing research, providing novel insights that are difficult to achieve with manual methods?
-   **Success Criteria**: Demonstrate a new analytical capability, such as quantifying discourse competition between rhetorical frames (e.g., populism vs. pluralism).
-   **Failure Response**: The value is limited to replication. Re-evaluate the commercial potential as a pure automation tool.

### **Gate 3: Results Analysis Usability**
-   **Question**: Can a researcher analyze the results of a Discernus experiment using a familiar Jupyter environment, without excessive friction?
-   **Success Criteria**: A target user (e.g., a graduate student) can become productive with the analysis workflow in less than two hours, satisfying at least 4/5 Jupyter Native Integration Heuristics.
-   **Failure Response**: A Jupyter-native approach is not viable. Pivot to a command-line-centric toolset or a more structured GUI.

### **Gate 4: Development Workflow Usability**
-   **Question**: Can a researcher use a Jupyter-native workflow for the *entire* process, from framework development to final analysis?
-   **Success Criteria**: Demonstrate a seamless, end-to-end workflow within the Jupyter environment.
-   **Failure Response**: The "all-in-Jupyter" vision is flawed. Accept that framework development and analysis execution will live in separate environments (e.g., VSCode/YAML for development, Jupyter for analysis).

### **Gate 5: Strategic Partnership Readiness**
-   **Question**: Is the combined package of tooling, documentation, and results compelling enough to secure a strategic partnership with a key academic team?
-   **Success Criteria**: A target academic partner (e.g., BYU's populism team) agrees that the methodology is defensible for publication and commits to a long-term collaboration.
-   **Failure Response**: The value proposition is not strong enough for deep partnerships. Re-evaluate the strategy to focus on individual researcher tools.

## Academic Partnership as Validation Vector: The BYU Case Study

The collaboration with the BYU Populism team serves as the primary testbed for validating all five gates.

-   **Gate 1 (Replication):** Replicate the findings of Tamaki & Fuks 2018.
-   **Gate 2 (Extension):** Analyze the populism vs. pluralism dimension in the Bolsonaro speeches.
-   **Gates 3 & 4 (Usability):** Use their graduate students as the target users for the Jupyter workflow testing.
-   **Gate 5 (Partnership):** The successful outcome of the previous gates will determine the scope and future of the partnership.

This ensures our validation process is grounded in a real-world, high-stakes academic research project, not just internal benchmarks.
