# Concept Storage Cabinet

This document is a holding area for valuable ideas and architectural concepts that are not part of the immediate, validation-focused development plan. By storing them here, we ensure they are not lost but also do not distract from the current mission.

## Future Platform Enhancements (Post-Validation)

### Advanced Infrastructure
-   **Workflow Engine Integration:** For experiments exceeding 1-2 hours, introduce a formal workflow engine like `Prefect` or `Airflow`. The current `execute_experiment()` functions would become tasks within this engine, allowing for sophisticated retry logic, scheduling, and concurrency management.
-   **Multi-Provider Orchestration:** An intelligent LLM gateway that can perform load balancing, cost optimization, and automatic failover between different API providers (e.g., if the OpenAI API is slow, route traffic to Anthropic).
-   **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard:** A web-based frontend (likely React/Vue) for live experiment monitoring, quality assessment, and results visualization, moving beyond the Jupyter-only interface for large-scale institutional use.

### Research & Analysis Capabilities
-   **Conversational Interface ("English as Code"):**
    -   **Vision:** Allow researchers to design and run experiments using natural language queries (e.g., "Compare OpenAI and Anthropic on my corpus of political speeches").
    -   **Architecture:** Use an LLM to translate natural language queries into the structured `.yaml` experiment definitions, which are then fed into the existing execution pipeline. This maintains rigor while dramatically improving accessibility.
-   **DCS-Aware AI Research Assistant:**
    -   **Vision:** A Jupyter AI chat participant that has deep knowledge of our Framework Specifications, mathematical foundations, and validation protocols.
    -   **Capabilities:** Can help a researcher generate a compliant framework from a natural language description, design a valid experiment, and automatically generate the methodology section for a paper.
-   **Advanced Research Dimensions:**
    -   **Unified `evaluators` Layer:** Extend the experiment definition to support not just LLMs, but also `human_crowd` (e.g., Mechanical Turk) and `human_offline` (for integrating pre-existing coded data) as analysts.
    -   **Context Enrichment (RAG):** Allow experiments to connect to a vector database to provide Retrieval-Augmented Generation capabilities to the analyzing LLM.
-   **Analysis Recipes (AR):** A simple YAML-based DSL for defining common post-analysis statistical operations (`filter`, `groupby`, `stats`) that can be chained together.

### Reporting & Visualization
-   **Stakeholder-Specific Reports:** A reporting engine that can generate different views of the same results: a high-level executive summary, a full academic technical report, and an accessible public version.
-   **Advanced Visualizations:** A library of additional DCS-specific plots, such as model centroid overlays with confidence ellipses and similarity heatmaps.
-   **Expanded Export Formats:** Direct export to LaTeX, Word, and other formats common in academic publishing pipelines.

### Resilience & Quality of Service
-   **Sufficiency Thresholds:** Define minimum requirements for a result to be considered valid (e.g., `min_overlapping_analyses: 20`, `min_success_rate_per_model: 0.75`).
-   **Graceful Degradation:** If an experiment has partial failures, it should assess if it still meets the sufficiency threshold. If so, it should complete with a "degraded analysis" warning; otherwise, it should abort with a clear failure report.
-   **Failure Classification:** Systematically track and classify failures (transient API errors vs. text-specific parsing errors vs. model-specific failures) to enable intelligent retry and failover logic.
-   **Pre-flight Health Checks:** Before running a costly experiment, assess external factors like API provider health and corpus complexity, and provide warnings to the user.
