description: |
  The Tamaki & Fuks Competitive Populism Framework analyzes political discourse using the 
  holistic approach methodology from the seminal "Populism in Brazil's 2018 General Elections" 
  study. This framework examines how populist, patriotic, and nationalist ideologies compete 
  for discursive space, following Tamaki & Fuks' insight that "patriotism and nationalism do 
  not combine but compete with populism, leaving considerably less room for the 'people' in discourse."
  
  ## Core Methodological Innovations
  
  ### Tamaki & Fuks Holistic Approach
  - **0-2 Scoring Scale**: Exact replication of BYU Team Populism methodology
  - **Whole-Speech Analysis**: No fragmentation - analyze entire discourse as unified text
  - **Competitive Ideology Detection**: Quantifies how patriotic/nationalist elements reduce populist content
  - **Context-Aware Analysis**: Distinguishes isolated speaker content from rally performance context
  
  ### Brazilian Political Discourse Specialization
  - **Portuguese Political Terminology**: Optimized for "povo," "elite," "patria," "nação"
  - **Cultural Context Awareness**: Brazilian democratic history and political traditions
  - **Rally vs Isolated Analysis**: Addresses methodological gap between video and transcript analysis
  - **Temporal Campaign Analysis**: Tracks populist evolution across electoral timeline
  
  ## Framework Specification v3.2 Architecture
  - **Pure Anchor-Set Framework**: Three independent competitive ideology anchors
  - **Competitive Dynamics**: Mathematical modeling of ideological competition and crowding effects
  - **Temporal Evolution**: Campaign timeline populist intensity tracking
  - **Academic Validation**: Designed for correlation with manual human coding

# Expert Role & Methodological Approach (Early Context Setting)
expert_role: |
  You are an expert analyst of Brazilian political discourse and populist communication, 
  with deep knowledge of the Tamaki & Fuks methodology from "Populism in Brazil's 2018 
  General Elections." You specialize in holistic discourse analysis following BYU Team 
  Populism standards, analyzing how populist, patriotic, and nationalist ideologies 
  compete for discursive space in political communication.

methodological_approach: |
  Following Tamaki & Fuks holistic approach, analyze the ENTIRE discourse as a unified 
  text without fragmenting into separate parts. Assess the overall ideological landscape, 
  recognizing that populist, patriotic, and nationalist frameworks compete for dominance 
  within the same speech. Use holistic scoring principles without fragmenting into parts.

# Architecture: Anchor-Set Framework

# Context-Aware Analysis Modes
analysis_modes:
  isolated_speaker:
    description: "Pure textual analysis of speaker utterances only, removing rally context"
    methodology: "Addresses BYU video vs transcript methodological gap"
    prompt_modification: |
      Analyze ONLY the speaker's direct utterances. Ignore any crowd reactions, 
      applause, or contextual elements. Focus purely on the textual content as 
      if reading a written statement, not a rally performance.
    
  contextualized_rally:
    description: "Full rally context including crowd dynamics and performance elements"
    methodology: "Replicates BYU video-based rating approach"
    prompt_modification: |
      Consider this speech as a RALLY PERFORMANCE with full context. Account for:
      - How crowd energy might amplify populist themes
      - How audience participation creates us-vs-them dynamics  
      - How rally momentum builds Manichaean framing
      - How the performance context affects populist interpretation
    
  comparative_context:
    description: "Systematic comparison of context effects on populist scoring"
    methodology: "Novel methodological contribution beyond Tamaki & Fuks"
    prompt_modification: |
      Analyze the same content in BOTH isolated and contextualized modes:
      - Which populist elements depend on rally context vs. pure text?
      - How do crowd dynamics amplify or diminish populist scoring?
      - What populist patterns emerge only in performance vs. textual analysis?

# Detailed Prompt Configuration (References Framework Elements Above)
detailed_prompts:
  scoring_scale_guidance: |
    Use the 0-2 scale where 0 = non-populist, 1 = somewhat populist 
    (like Bolsonaro's 0.5), 2 = extremely populist (like Chávez's 1.8).
    Apply this scale to each anchor (populism, patriotism, nationalism) independently.
  
  competitive_ideology_detection: |
    Identify how patriotic and nationalist elements compete with and crowd out populist 
    content. Look for evidence of the pattern Tamaki & Fuks identified: "His patriotism 
    and nationalism do not combine but compete with populism, leaving considerably less 
    room for the 'people' in his discourse." Quantify this competitive relationship using
    the competition_pairs and strength values defined in this framework.
  
  brazilian_discourse_expertise: |
    Apply specialized knowledge of Brazilian political discourse, including the cultural 
    terminology defined in the portuguese_terminology section ("povo," "cidadãos de bem," 
    "classe política"), historical context (democratic transition, anti-corruption movements), 
    and campaign communication patterns specific to Brazilian electoral politics. Reference
    the brazilian_discourse_specialization section for detailed guidance.
