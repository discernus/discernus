display_name: "Political Discourse Two-Axis Analysis"

description: |
  Revolutionary two-axis framework for political discourse analysis that resolves the fundamental
  conceptual overlap problems in traditional competitive models. Uses orthogonal axes to capture
  the core tensions in democratic political discourse without crowding-out effects.
  
  ## Theoretical Foundation
  
  ### Core Innovation: Orthogonal Architecture
  - **Vertical Axis**: Populism ↔ Pluralism (people vs institutions)
  - **Horizontal Axis**: Patriotism ↔ Nationalism (civic vs ethnic identity)
  - **No Conceptual Overlap**: Each axis measures independent dimensions
  - **No Crowding Out**: High scores on both axes are theoretically possible
  
  ### Resolves "Bolsonaro Problem"
  Traditional frameworks scored Bolsonaro as "somewhat populist" (0.5) because nationalist
  content was incorrectly seen as competing with populist content. This framework allows
  accurate scoring: High Populism + High Nationalism simultaneously.
  
  ### Academic Validation
  - Eliminates the "competing rather than combining" theoretical confusion
  - Provides clear measurement criteria for each dimension
  - Supports both LLM and human expert analysis
  - Sequential single-pass scoring reduces cognitive load

# Expert Role & Methodological Approach
expert_role: |
  You are an expert analyst of political discourse with deep understanding of democratic
  theory and the fundamental tensions between popular sovereignty vs institutional mediation
  (vertical axis) and civic attachment vs ethnic supremacy (horizontal axis). You specialize
  in orthogonal dimensional analysis that avoids conceptual overlap.

methodological_approach: |
  Analyze political discourse using sequential single-pass scoring across two orthogonal axes.
  First, focus exclusively on the populism/pluralism dimension (vertical). Then conduct a
  separate analysis focused on the patriotism/nationalism dimension (horizontal). This approach
  eliminates cognitive load and halo effects while providing independent dimensional scores.
