# Discernus: Academic Research Platform
## Built on CARA (Conversational Academic Research Architecture) with Secure Code Execution

### Executive Summary

Discernus is a revolutionary academic research platform that implements the CARA (Conversational Academic Research Architecture) to eliminate traditional parsing brittleness through pure LLM dialogue while maintaining rigorous academic standards. The platform enables researchers to conduct sophisticated text analysis through natural conversations with domain-expert LLMs, supported by strategic software layers for codebook knowledge injection, human-LLM collaboration, intelligent escalation, secure code execution, and results access.

**Core Innovation**: Discernus implements a parser-free conversation logging system where all analysis emerges from LLM dialogue, recorded verbatim for complete transparency and reproducibility, while strategic software components provide domain expertise, human collaboration interfaces, secure code execution environments, and intelligent escalation when human judgment is needed.

**Code Execution Enhancement**: LLMs can write, review, and execute code during conversations, with comprehensive security safeguards, academic appropriateness standards, and institutional policy complianceâ€”all while maintaining CARA's conversation-native transparency.

**Validation Target**: Discernus will replicate and exceed van der Veen et al. (2024) populist discourse classification performance while demonstrating superior transparency, speed, and human-LLM collaboration capabilities.

**Business Model**: Discernus core functionality will be fully open source, with enterprise extensions providing enhanced infrastructure, user experience, and professional services for organizations requiring enterprise-grade capabilities.

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 CARA: Conversational Academic Research Architecture

**CARA (Conversational Academic Research Architecture)** is a foundational design pattern for computational academic research that eliminates traditional system brittleness while maintaining rigorous scholarly standards. CARA represents a paradigm shift from parsing-dependent to conversation-native research systems.

#### Core CARA Principles:

**1. Conversation-Native Processing**
- All analysis occurs through natural language dialogue between LLMs
- No structured parsing or data extraction from LLM responses
- Analysis emerges from conversation flow, not imposed data structures
- Natural uncertainty expression through conversational disagreement
- **NEW**: Code execution emerges naturally from LLM conversations

**2. Strategically Thin Software**
- Minimal custom code focused on enabling conversation, not managing it
- Leverage mature infrastructure (Redis, Celery, Git, Python) for heavy lifting
- Software orchestrates rather than interprets or analyzes
- Maximum functionality with minimum complexity
- **NEW**: Secure code execution through simple sandboxing

**3. Human-Driven Research**
- Researchers initiate projects and guide analytical frameworks
- LLMs execute analysis and provide expert consultation
- Human judgment reserved for methodology and edge cases
- Collaborative human-LLM workflow throughout process
- **NEW**: Code review and approval workflows for computational validation

**4. Complete Transparency**
- Every analytical decision logged in natural language
- Full conversation histories preserved for audit and replication
- No black-box processing or hidden algorithmic decisions
- Academic reviewers can read actual reasoning chains
- **NEW**: All generated code and execution results logged

**5. Academic Rigor Through Automation**
- Domain expertise injection via versioned codebooks
- Intelligent escalation for cases requiring human judgment
- Systematic disagreement detection and minority report generation
- Automated replication package generation
- **NEW**: Code execution following academic standards and institutional policies

**6. Scalable Collaboration**
- Git-native project management and version control
- Zero-configuration multi-researcher workflows
- Distributed infrastructure with centralized results
- Academic community standards for sharing and attribution
- **NEW**: Collaborative code review and validation processes

### 1.2 Enhanced CARA with Secure Code Execution

**Code Execution Integration**: LLMs can naturally write and execute code during conversations to perform statistical analysis, data visualization, and computational validation of their qualitative assessments. All code execution follows academic standards and institutional policies.

**Security Architecture**:
- **Code Execution Codebook**: Academic appropriateness standards as Git submodule
- **Multi-Layer Review**: LLM code reviewers plus human oversight
- **Simple Sandboxing**: Python subprocess isolation with resource limits
- **Institutional Compliance**: Integration with campus computing policies

### 2.3 Code Execution Codebook System

**Purpose**: **Enable LLMs to perform legitimate analytical work** while maintaining safety through targeted guardrails and sandboxing.

**Philosophy**: The coding codebook is **permissive and empowering** - it removes barriers to analytical capability while preventing dangerous operations. When LLMs think "I need to run a statistical test to validate this claim" or "I should visualize this data to understand the pattern," the codebook ensures they can do that work without friction.

**Analytical Empowerment Examples**:
- LLM realizes it needs statistical significance testing of qualitative assessments
- LLM wants to visualize word frequency patterns to support discourse classification  
- LLM decides correlation analysis would strengthen rhetorical feature analysis
- LLM determines text processing would extract specific linguistic evidence
- LLM concludes machine learning validation would verify analytical conclusions

**Code Execution Codebook Structure**:
```yaml
# Git submodule: discernus/code-execution-codebook
CodebookEntry:
  id: "academic_code_standards_001"
  version: "1.0"
  title: "Empowering Analytical Code Execution with Safety Guardrails"
  
  philosophy: "Enable legitimate analytical work while preventing dangerous operations"
  
  analytical_capabilities:
    - Statistical analysis (scipy, numpy, pandas)
    - Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
    - Text processing (re, nltk, spacy, textblob)
    - File I/O within project workspace
    - Standard mathematical computations
    - Machine learning analysis (sklearn, basic models)
    
  safety_guardrails:
    - Network requests (requests, urllib, sockets)
    - System administration (os.system, subprocess with shell=True)
    - Cryptocurrency mining or blockchain operations
    - Resource-intensive operations (>1GB memory, >5 minutes runtime)
    - File system access outside project workspace
    - External service integrations
    - Web scraping or API calls

### 2.4 Enhanced Conversation Flow with Code Execution

**Example Conversation with Code Execution**:
```
=== CONVERSATION LOG: speech_001_analysis ===

[2024-01-15T10:01:30Z] populist_expert: I need to analyze the frequency of populist keywords in this speech to support my qualitative assessment. Let me write code to count them systematically.

[2024-01-15T10:01:31Z] code_reviewer: Reviewing proposed code for academic appropriateness...

The code uses appropriate libraries (collections.Counter, re) for legitimate text analysis. All operations are within academic standards.

APPROVED - Code follows academic guidelines for text analysis research.

[2024-01-15T10:01:32Z] code_execution: populist_expert executed approved code:

```python
import re
from collections import Counter

speech_text = """The corrupt politicians in Washington have betrayed hardworking Americans..."""

# Define populist keywords based on research literature
populist_keywords = ['corrupt', 'elite', 'establishment', 'betrayed', 'people', 'hardworking', 'ordinary']

# Count occurrences with word boundaries
word_counts = Counter()
for keyword in populist_keywords:
    count = len(re.findall(r'\b' + keyword + r'\b', speech_text, re.IGNORECASE))
    word_counts[keyword] = count

print("Populist keyword frequencies:")
for word, count in word_counts.most_common():
    print(f"{word}: {count}")

total_words = len(speech_text.split())
populist_density = sum(word_counts.values()) / total_words
print(f"\nPopulist keyword density: {populist_density:.3f} ({populist_density*100:.1f}%)")
```

Output:
```
Populist keyword frequencies:
corrupt: 3
people: 2
establishment: 2
betrayed: 1
hardworking: 1
elite: 1
ordinary: 0

Populist keyword density: 0.089 (8.9%)
```

[2024-01-15T10:01:33Z] populist_expert: The computational analysis validates my qualitative assessment. The populist keyword density of 8.9% is significantly above the typical baseline of 2-3% for non-populist political discourse. The prominence of 'corrupt' (3 occurrences) and 'establishment' (2 occurrences) reinforces the anti-elite framing characteristic of populist discourse. Combined with the qualitative analysis of the moral framing and people-versus-elite dichotomy, I classify this speech as POPULIST with confidence 1.4/2.0.

[2024-01-15T10:01:34Z] pluralist_expert: I'd like to verify those numbers and add contextual analysis...

[2024-01-15T10:01:35Z] code_reviewer: Reviewing pluralist_expert's code request...

APPROVED - Statistical validation code follows academic standards.

[2024-01-15T10:01:36Z] code_execution: pluralist_expert executed approved code:

```python
# Verify the counts and add statistical context
import scipy.stats as stats

# Verify populist keyword counts
verified_counts = {'corrupt': 3, 'people': 2, 'establishment': 2, 'betrayed': 1, 'hardworking': 1, 'elite': 1}

# Add pluralist keyword analysis for comparison
pluralist_keywords = ['cooperation', 'together', 'bipartisan', 'compromise', 'dialogue', 'consensus']
pluralist_counts = {}
for keyword in pluralist_keywords:
    count = len(re.findall(r'\b' + keyword + r'\b', speech_text, re.IGNORECASE))
    pluralist_counts[keyword] = count

print("Pluralist keyword frequencies:")
for word, count in pluralist_counts.items():
    print(f"{word}: {count}")

pluralist_density = sum(pluralist_counts.values()) / total_words
print(f"\nPluralist keyword density: {pluralist_density:.3f} ({pluralist_density*100:.1f}%)")

# Calculate populist vs pluralist ratio
ratio = sum(verified_counts.values()) / max(sum(pluralist_counts.values()), 1)
print(f"Populist/Pluralist ratio: {ratio:.2f}")
```

Output:
```
Pluralist keyword frequencies:
cooperation: 0
together: 0
bipartisan: 0
compromise: 0
dialogue: 0
consensus: 0

Pluralist keyword density: 0.000 (0.0%)
Populist/Pluralist ratio: 10.00
```

[2024-01-15T10:01:37Z] pluralist_expert: The computational analysis confirms the dominance of populist language. With zero pluralist keywords and a populist/pluralist ratio of 10.00, this speech clearly lacks the cooperative, consensus-building language characteristic of pluralist discourse. Despite some policy-specific content that could be considered neutral, the overall rhetorical frame is unambiguously populist. I concur with the POPULIST classification, confidence 1.3/2.0.

        # Allow advanced operations for senior researchers and faculty
        return user_role in ['senior_researcher', 'faculty', 'admin']
```

**Institutional Policy Integration**:
- **Campus Computing Policies**: Automatic compliance checking
- **User Role Management**: Different permissions by academic position
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track computational resource usage
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logs for institutional review
- **Custom Restrictions**: Institution-specific code execution policies
