# Framework Design Methodology: Evolution and Next Steps

## **Conceptual Evolution: From Problem to Solution**

### **Original Problem Recognition (Civic Virtue Development)**
During Civic Virtue framework development, the realization emerged that **DCS map positioning must reflect underlying theory**. Five axes with normative assessments ("integrative" vs "disintegrative" anchors) revealed that:

1. **Axis placement has inherent meaning** - positioning isn't arbitrary
2. **Some axes are more conceptually powerful** - literature suggested identity axis (dignity/tribalism) was more fundamental
3. **Visual positioning affects interpretation** - 12 o'clock placement gives "extra power" through perpendicularity to X-axis
4. **Hierarchy needs mathematical expression** - every degree from 12 o'clock represents "softening" of power

### **Methodology Development**
**Angle Weighting Discovery**: "Axis angle is destiny" - systematic use of angular positioning to encode research-based hierarchy insights.

**Weight Multiplication Extension**: Recognition that angular positioning alone might be insufficient; additional numerical weights provide precision beyond geometric constraints.

**Recommended Sequence**: Angles first (intuitive, elegant), then weights (mathematical precision), always with research justification.

### **Framework Agnostic Generalization**
**Critical Principle**: Take insights from CV development and generalize without hardcoding specific implementations (e.g., "integrative vs disintegrative") into specification.

**Sedimentary Process**: Framework developers explore and argue → truly generalizable concepts distill into framework-agnostic specification → scrupulous defense of agnosticism.

## **Current Framework Architecture**

### **Default State**
- **Equidistant axes** unless research justifies hierarchy
- Framework choice (axis-based vs anchor-based) drives initial geometry

### **Hierarchy Design Process**
1. **Research-Based Justification**: Cite literature supporting axis importance ranking
2. **Angle-Based Hierarchy**: Position primary axis at 12 o'clock, arrange others by decreasing importance
3. **Weight-Based Fine-Tuning**: Apply numerical multipliers for precision beyond angular positioning
4. **Defense Requirement**: Framework developers must justify all non-equidistant arrangements

### **Mathematical Tools**
- **Hierarchy-Preserving Analysis**: Default behavior maintains intended theoretical weighting
- **Hierarchy-Agnostic Corrections**: Optional mathematical adjustments for "pure" distance measurements

## **Terminology Resolution**

### **Rejected: "Semantic Density"**
**Problems Identified**:
- Suggests measuring text richness rather than design choices
- Creates gravitational field visualization (problematic given past "narrative gravity" reactions)
- Implies discovered property rather than deliberate design methodology

### **Preferred Terminology**
- **Axis Hierarchy Design**
- **Theoretical Weighting Methodology**
- **Research-Based Positioning**
- **Framework Architecture Choices**

## **Next Steps Identified**

### **1. Specification Enhancement**
**Framework Design Methodology Section**:
- Research → angle → weight → justification process
- When to use equidistant vs. hierarchical arrangements
- How to cite literature supporting hierarchy decisions
- Mathematical tools for hierarchy-agnostic analysis

### **2. Documentation Strategy**
**Layered Approach**:
- Walk through hierarchy design process in specification
- Encourage framework developers to describe and defend design choices
- Expand with illustrations once visualization formats stabilize
- **Pictures > words** for geometric concepts

### **3. Named Axes Consideration**
**Specification Addition**: 
- Add named axes as formal concept option
- Helps maintain clarity during development and application
- Currently missing from glossary and specification

### **4. Implementation Priorities**
**Default Behavior**: 
- Preserve intended hierarchy as default
- Make corrections opt-in rather than default
- Maintain framework agnosticism throughout

## **Foundational Principles Established**

### **Framework Agnosticism Defense**
- No hardcoded semantic assumptions in specification
- Structure supports various implementations without prescribing content
- Sedimentary process distills generalizable concepts while remaining theory-neutral

### **Research-Driven Design**
- All hierarchy decisions require literature justification
- Framework developers must defend non-equidistant choices
- Mathematical precision serves theoretical insights, not vice versa

### **Methodology Over Discovery**
- Present as design methodology rather than discovered mathematical property
- Focus on tools for encoding research insights into coordinate systems
- Maintain intellectual honesty about constructed vs. natural properties

**Status**: Conceptual framework established, ready for specification implementation  
**Key Insight**: This is framework design methodology, not semantic space physics  
**Next Phase**: Translate insights into formal specification language with visual examples
