# Aggressively Batching Experimental Runs with Gemini 2.5 Pro: Fully Detailed Framework

## Strategic Rationale

For large-scale text analysis (e.g., evaluating political speeches), aggressively batching runs with Gemini 2.5 Pro‚Äîsupported by synthetic calibration and robust statistical sampling‚Äîdelivers:

- **High analytical rigor:** Consistent, confident estimates and statistically sound means.
- **Significant cost and time reduction:** Fewer redundant LLM calls.
- **Maximum scalability:** Supports full-corpus evaluations in a single pass without reliability loss.

## Step 1: Synthetic Representative Text Generation with Gemini 2.5 Flash

### Why This Matters

- **Variance Calibration:** Directly measuring run-to-run variance on each speech is costly. But most speeches of a genre share structural and rhetorical patterns; variance across the set is generally similar.
- **Statistical Representativeness:** Using an LLM to synthesize a single text that embodies these collective patterns provides a practical, data-driven baseline‚Äîso you avoid over- or underestimating evaluation needs.
- **Efficiency:** This approach front-loads complexity into a single ‚Äúpilot‚Äù batch, reducing total runs required for the entire corpus.

### How to Execute

1. **Prepare the Full Corpus:**
   - Collect all texts you intend to analyze (e.g., 10‚Äì300 political speeches).
2. **Concatenate or Structure:**
   - Feed the full set, in order or as a block, into Gemini 2.5 Flash (up to 1M tokens[1]).
3. **Prompt for a Synthetic Representative:**
   - Instruct the model to generate a text capturing rhetorical style, structure, and topic breadth of the input set.
   - Example prompt:  
     _‚ÄúGenerate a synthetic speech that combines average rhetorical, structural, and thematic features of these 300 political addresses, preserving representative sentence complexity and vocabulary.‚Äù_
4. **Validate Representativeness:**
   - Optionally, compare summary statistics (e.g., word count, sentence complexity, key topic coverage, readability indices) of the synthetic text to medians or means from the original corpus to ensure a close match.
   - Embedding-based or LLM-based similarity scoring can also be deployed for additional assurance[2][3].
5. **Run a Pilot Batch:**
   - Perform 8‚Äì12 scoring runs on this synthetic speech using the same LLM configuration and framework as will be used in full analysis.
   - Record the scores for sampling analysis.

**Key Outcome:**  
You now have an empirical estimate of the scoring mean ($$\mu$$) and standard deviation ($$\sigma$$), providing the coefficient of variation ($$\text{CV} = \sigma/\mu$$) that reflects the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù LLM variance you are likely to face for the entire batch.

## Step 2: Sequential Sampling with Gemini 2.5 Pro

### Why This Matters

- **Statistical Confidence Without Overkill:** Rather than taking a fixed number of runs (risking unneeded cost/time), sequential sampling ensures you stop when the mean estimate is statistically reliable.
- **Empirical Risk Control:** Ensures resource expenditure is tied directly to observed model stability in this application, not generic assumptions.
- **Proven Efficiency:** Sequential Probability Ratio Testing (SPRT) and similar adaptive algorithms save up to 75% on evaluation runs by halting when convergence is visible[4][3][5].

### The What ‚Äî Detailed Process

#### 1. **Calculate the Minimum Sample Size (n) Needed**
Utilize the pilot‚Äôs coefficient of variation to estimate the minimum robust sample size at desired confidence:

$$
n = \left(\frac{z \cdot \text{CV}}{E}\right)^2
$$

Where:
- $$z$$ = 1.96 for 95% confidence,
- $$\text{CV}$$ = empirical coefficient of variation from Step 1,
- $$E$$ = desired margin of error (e.g., 1% of the mean).

**Example:**

- $$\mu = 80$$, $$\sigma = 1.6$$ ‚áí $$\text{CV}=0.02$$ (or 2%),
- $$E = 0.01$$,
- $$
n = \left(\frac{1.96 \times 0.02}{0.01}\right)^2 = (3.92)^2 \approx 15.4
$$
- **Result:** 16 runs required.

#### 2. **Run Initial Batch, Then Use Sequential Evaluation**

- **Initial Runs:** Begin by running the minimum sample size (e.g., 8‚Äì12 if resource-constrained), compute the running mean and standard error.
- **Update Confidence Interval:**
  $$
  \text{Confidence interval half-width} = z \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$
  Where $$s$$ is sample standard deviation and $$n$$ is current sample size.
- **Sequential Probability Ratio Testing (SPRT):**
  - After every new run, check if your confidence interval half-width is at or below $$E$$.  
  - If yes: **Stop**‚Äîyour sample mean is reliable to the desired degree.
  - If not: **Continue**‚Äîadd another run, recalculate, and check again.
  - Optionally, apply a maximum cap if progress stalls.

**Optional Acceleration:**  
- Monitor the difference in means between most recent $$k$$ runs (e.g., last 5 vs. prior 5). If the difference falls below a threshold (e.g., 0.1% of the mean) for several consecutive windows, you can stop without waiting for the theoretical margin[6].

**Advantages:**
- Reduces unnecessary runs in highly stable scoring scenarios.
- Ensures rigorous, actionable statistics for decision-making.
- Pilot-derived $$\text{CV}$$ dynamically reflects any peculiarities in this specific batch, eliminating broad-brush prescriptive sample sizes.

## Step 3: Batched Evaluation of the Entire Corpus

Armed with sample size guidance from calibration, you can:

- **Assign the empirically-calibrated run count (e.g., 16) to each speech.**
- **Batch all speeches into the fewest Gemini 2.5 Pro calls possible (max 1,000,000 tokens/request ‚âà 341 speeches per batch at 2,925 tokens each).**

## Tables: Batch and Run Sizing

| **Parameter**             | **Value**         |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Context window (Pro)      | 1,000,000 tokens  |
| Avg. speech size          | 2,925 tokens      |
| **Max speeches per batch**| 341               |
| Scoring runs per speech   | 16 (example)      |
| 10-speech batch, total runs| 160              |

## Why This Delivers Reliable, Cost-Effective Analysis

- **Statistical rigor built-in:** Confidence and error margins directly informed by observed LLM scoring behavior.
- **No over-provisioning:** Synthetic calibration removes the need for arbitrary conservative sample sizes.
- **Massive aggregation:** Gemini 2.5 Pro‚Äôs context window enables you to scale instantly‚Äîhundreds of full-length texts batched together‚Äîwith guaranteed accuracy maintained[1][7][5][8].
- **Empirical evidence:** Both Google‚Äôs own benchmarks and independent evaluations confirm Gemini 2.5 series can sustain accuracy and reasoning depth across million-token prompts[9][7][5][10].
