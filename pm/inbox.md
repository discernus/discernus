# Inbox - Raw Backlog Items

**Purpose**: Raw capture of backlog items without organization or sprint planning. Items here will be groomed into organized sprints later.

**Usage**: 
- "inbox this" → append new items here with minimal formatting
- "groom our sprints" → move all items from here to sprints.md with proper organization

## Ready for New Items

*All previous items have been groomed into organized sprints. Add new backlog items here with minimal formatting for future grooming sessions.*

**BUG-001**: CLI flag compliance gap - synthesis stage agents default to Flash instead of Flash Lite despite explicit CLI specification

**ARCH-THIN-001**: YAML parsing violates THIN principles - implement hash/cache/pass-through architecture for framework and corpus specifications

**PROVENANCE-001**: Refactor results folder structure - consolidate all session content in results folder, create symlinks to shared cache assets for improved provenance and auditing capabilities

**CLI-UX-011**: Allow direct experiment file paths - enhance run/validate commands to accept either experiment directory OR direct path to experiment.md file for improved user experience

**BUG-002**: Cost tracking reporting zero costs despite successful LLM calls - CLI shows $0.0000 and 0 tokens even when cost log contains actual usage data (~$0.003, 23K tokens)
