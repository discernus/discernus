# Inbox - Raw Backlog Items

**Purpose**: Raw capture of backlog items without organization or sprint planning. Items here will be groomed into organized sprints later.

**Usage**: 
- "inbox this" → append new items here with minimal formatting
- "groom our sprints" → move all items from here to sprints.md with proper organization

## Add Standard Boilerplate Methodology Section to Synthesis Reports

**Date**: 2025-01-27
**Priority**: Medium
**Category**: Documentation, User Experience

**Description**: Design and implement a standard boilerplate Methodology section for synthesis reports to ensure consistency and completeness across all research outputs.

**Context**: Currently, synthesis reports may lack consistent methodology documentation, making it difficult for researchers and reviewers to understand the analytical approach used.

**Requirements**:
- Standardized methodology section template
- Framework-agnostic design
- Integration with existing synthesis pipeline
- Academic standards compliance
- Customizable for different research contexts

**Considerations**:
- What elements should be included in the methodology section?
- How to make it framework-agnostic while being informative?
- Integration with existing report generation system
- Template customization options
- Quality assurance and validation

**Next Steps**: 
- Research existing methodology section best practices
- Design template structure
- Plan integration approach
- Create implementation roadmap
