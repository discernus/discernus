# Inbox - Raw Backlog Items

**Purpose**: Raw capture of backlog items without organization or sprint planning. Items here will be groomed into organized sprints later.

**Usage**:

- "inbox this" → append new items here with minimal formatting
- "groom our sprints" → move all items from here to sprints.md with proper organization
