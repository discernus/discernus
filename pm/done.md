#### [CRITICAL-001] Fix Graceful Degradation in Derived Metrics Phase ✅ **COMPLETED**

- **Description**: **CRITICAL BUG**: Derived metrics phase failures are being silently caught and the experiment continues with degraded results instead of failing fast
- **Dependencies**: None (blocking everything)
- **Root Cause**: Lines 197-201 in CleanAnalysisOrchestrator catch derived metrics failures and continue with `{"error": str(e), "status": "failed"}` instead of propagating the error
- **Evidence**: Terminal shows "Derived metrics phase failed, attempting to continue: Derived metrics functions file not found" but experiment completes successfully
- **Impact**:
  - Masks critical LLM generation failures
  - Produces unreliable experiment results
  - Violates THIN architecture fail-fast principles

### 🔧 Infrastructure & Dependencies ✅ COMPLETED

#### [INFRA-001] LiteLLM Proxy Dependency Issue ✅ COMPLETED
- **Description**: ✅ COMPLETED - LiteLLM was missing the 'backoff' dependency, causing debug warnings during LLM calls
- **Impact**: ✅ RESOLVED - Debug log noise eliminated, cleaner logging during LLM operations
- **Root Cause**: ✅ IDENTIFIED - Missing `pip install 'litellm[proxy]'` dependency for backoff module (used by LiteLLM internally)
- **Implementation Results**:
  - ✅ Successfully installed `litellm[proxy]` with all required dependencies
  - ✅ Backoff module now available and importable
  - ✅ Debug warnings "Unable to import proxy_server for cold storage logging" eliminated
  - ✅ No functional impact on core system - just logging cleanup
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ ALL MET
  - ✅ Backoff module successfully imported without errors
  - ✅ LiteLLM dependencies fully satisfied
  - ✅ Debug warnings eliminated from LLM call logs
  - ✅ System functionality maintained
- **Effort**: ✅ COMPLETED - Low (30 minutes)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Priority**: ✅ **LOW** - Logging noise resolved
- **Current State**: Clean logging with all LiteLLM dependencies satisfied
- **Resolution Date**: 2025-01-27

#### [INFRA-002] LiteLLM Cold Storage Configuration Messages ✅ COMPLETED
