- **CRITICAL-001**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Fail-fast behavior implemented
- **CRITICAL-002**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Derived metrics cache stale file references fixed

#### [CRITICAL-001] Fix Graceful Degradation in Derived Metrics Phase ✅ **COMPLETED**

- **Description**: **CRITICAL BUG**: Derived metrics phase failures are being silently caught and the experiment continues with degraded results instead of failing fast
- **Dependencies**: None (blocking everything)
- **Root Cause**: Lines 197-201 in CleanAnalysisOrchestrator catch derived metrics failures and continue with `{"error": str(e), "status": "failed"}` instead of propagating the error
- **Evidence**: Terminal shows "Derived metrics phase failed, attempting to continue: Derived metrics functions file not found" but experiment completes successfully
- **Impact**:
  - Masks critical LLM generation failures
  - Produces unreliable experiment results
  - Violates THIN architecture fail-fast principles
  - Makes debugging extremely difficult
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [X] Derived metrics phase failures cause immediate experiment termination
  - [X] Clear error messages indicate the specific failure point
  - [X] No graceful degradation for critical pipeline components

### 🔧 Infrastructure & Dependencies ✅ COMPLETED

#### [INFRA-001] LiteLLM Proxy Dependency Issue ✅ COMPLETED
- **Description**: ✅ COMPLETED - LiteLLM was missing the 'backoff' dependency, causing debug warnings during LLM calls
- **Impact**: ✅ RESOLVED - Debug log noise eliminated, cleaner logging during LLM operations
- **Root Cause**: ✅ IDENTIFIED - Missing `pip install 'litellm[proxy]'` dependency for backoff module (used by LiteLLM internally)
- **Implementation Results**:
  - ✅ Successfully installed `litellm[proxy]` with all required dependencies
  - ✅ Backoff module now available and importable
  - ✅ Debug warnings "Unable to import proxy_server for cold storage logging" eliminated
  - ✅ No functional impact on core system - just logging cleanup
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ ALL MET
  - ✅ Backoff module successfully imported without errors
  - ✅ LiteLLM dependencies fully satisfied
  - ✅ Debug warnings eliminated from LLM call logs
  - ✅ System functionality maintained
- **Effort**: ✅ COMPLETED - Low (30 minutes)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Priority**: ✅ **LOW** - Logging noise resolved
- **Current State**: Clean logging with all LiteLLM dependencies satisfied
- **Resolution Date**: 2025-01-27

#### [INFRA-002] LiteLLM Cold Storage Configuration Messages ✅ COMPLETED
- **Description**: ✅ COMPLETED - After fixing the missing backoff dependency, LiteLLM was working but generating debug messages about missing cold storage configuration
- **Impact**: ✅ RESOLVED - Cold storage debug messages suppressed to WARNING level, cleaner logging
- **Root Cause**: ✅ IDENTIFIED - LiteLLM working correctly but showing debug messages for optional cold storage features (part of the core library, not proxy server)
- **Implementation Results**:
  - ✅ Added `LITELLM_PROXY_LOG_LEVEL=WARNING` environment variable
  - ✅ Added `LITELLM_COLD_STORAGE_LOG_LEVEL=WARNING` environment variable
  - ✅ Environment variables set in `discernus/gateway/llm_gateway.py` during initialization

- **Solution**: Implemented automated provenance validation system, added cross-reference validation between logs, artifacts, and model usage, implemented integrity checks for model attribution accuracy, added automated detection of missing or corrupted artifacts, implemented validation alerts for provenance chain breaks, created recovery procedures for corrupted provenance chains, established academic integrity compliance validation framework
- **Testing**: Tested provenance validation with various failure scenarios, validated recovery procedures for corrupted chains, tested academic integrity compliance framework
- **Priority**: HIGH - System reliability and academic standards
- **Status**: **COMPLETED** - Implemented provenance consolidation system and input materials consolidation for golden run archives

#### [HIGH-011] LLM Interaction Logging Enhancement for Fallback Scenarios ✅ **COMPLETED**

- **Description**: Enhance LLM interaction logging to capture complete fallback scenarios with accurate model attribution
- **Problem**: Current logging didn't clearly show which model actually completed each analysis
- **Impact**: Incomplete audit trail, debugging difficulties, transparency issues
- **Dependencies**: Connected to model attribution fix (CRITICAL-006), CLI flag compliance (CRITICAL-007), and timezone handling (HIGH-008)
- **Solution**: Enhanced LLM interaction logging for fallback scenarios, added clear model attribution in all interaction logs, implemented fallback event tracking with before/after model information, added complete conversation logging for both primary and fallback models, implemented model performance metrics tracking (success/failure rates, response times), added cost tracking for fallback scenarios, enhanced debugging tools for fallback analysis
- **Testing**: Tested enhanced logging with fallback scenarios, validated model performance metrics accuracy, tested debugging tools with enhanced logging
- **Priority**: HIGH - System transparency and debugging capability
- **Status**: **COMPLETED** - Enhanced logging with comprehensive provenance consolidation and golden run documentation system

#### [BONUS-001] Golden Run Archive System (Research Transparency Enhancement) ✅ **COMPLETED**

- **Description**: Comprehensive system for creating self-contained, peer-review-ready research archives
- **Problem**: Need for complete research transparency packages that satisfy demanding future audiences (replication researchers, peer reviewers, auditors)
- **Impact**: Enhanced research reproducibility, academic integrity, and stakeholder confidence
- **Solution**: 
  - ✅ **Provenance Consolidation**: `consolidate_provenance` CLI command consolidates scattered log data into comprehensive JSON reports
  - ✅ **Input Materials Consolidation**: `consolidate_inputs` CLI command copies all input materials (corpus, experiment spec, framework) into results directory
  - ✅ **Golden Run Documentation**: `generate_golden_run_docs` CLI command creates comprehensive stakeholder-specific navigation guides
  - ✅ **Stakeholder Navigation**: Tailored guidance for Primary Researcher, Internal Reviewer, Replication Researcher, Fraud Auditor, and LLM Skeptic
  - ✅ **Audit Workflows**: Step-by-step guidance for different types of audits (5 min, 30 min, 2+ hours)
  - ✅ **Complete Archive Structure**: Self-contained packages with all inputs, outputs, and documentation
- **Testing**: 
  - ✅ Tested with existing experiment runs
  - ✅ Validated comprehensive documentation generation
  - ✅ Confirmed stakeholder-specific navigation works correctly
- **Priority**: HIGH - Research transparency and academic standards
- **Status**: **COMPLETED** - Full golden run archive system implemented and tested
