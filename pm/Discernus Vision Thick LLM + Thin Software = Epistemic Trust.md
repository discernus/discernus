## Discernus LLM-Augmented Rhetorical Analysis Workflow

### 1. Schema Synthesis & Theoretical Foundation
* **Discerna Founder/Editorial Team** synthesizes and updates a master rhetorical schema based on the latest peer-reviewed research.
* Schema is **explicitly descriptive**, not normative; designed for *maximum modularity* and extensibility, supporting both mainstream and heterodox analytic approaches
⠀
### 2. Researcher Ideation & Framework Development
* **Researcher A** proposes a new analytic framework (“Framework X”)—a set of concepts or hypotheses for analyzing a rhetorical corpus.
* **Corpus Y** is assembled: a collection of rhetorical texts/data with potential relevance to Framework X.
* Researcher A describes why their framework might yield valuable insights, noting anticipated edge cases, dissent, or anomalies.

### 3. LLM Experiment Coach Collaboration
* **Experiment Coach LLM**, trained on the master schema, assists Researcher A:
  * Maps Framework X to the most relevant schema elements.
  * Explicitly flags areas where Framework X diverges from, or extends, current schema knowledge.
  * Proposes “Experiment 1” for applying Framework X to Corpus Y, with rigor-focused documentation (objectives, variables, analysis methods).
  * **Adversarial Review LLM** is introduced at this stage to challenge assumptions, surface potential blind spots, and propose alternative framings.
* Researcher A reviews, provides feedback, and refines the experiment with the Coach, prioritizing *clarity, completeness, and contestability*.

### 4. Experiment Orchestration & Ingestion
* **Experiment Orchestrator LLM** is activated upon Researcher A’s approval.
* **Ingestion Worker LLM** processes Corpus Y:
  * Performs normalization, metadata extraction, and prepares data for analysis according to the experiment’s exact specs.
* **QC LLM** inspects all ingested data and experiment definitions, with **authority to escalate to the researcher** or block further steps if anomalies or inconsistencies are detected.
* **Adversarial Reviewer LLM** is tasked with stress-testing both corpus selection and framework mapping for bias, coverage gaps, or error modes.
* All assets and process versions are securely stored and auditable.

### 5. Multi-Layered Experiment Execution
* Orchestrator runs the experiment using an **ensemble of LLMs**, as defined in Experiment 1.
* **Transaction logging** ensures every analytic operation is versioned, reproducible, and auditable.
* Each rhetorical text may be analyzed by multiple LLMs, using varying prompts and analytic strategies.
* **Minority Report Protocol:**
  * Ensemble outputs are not simply averaged; significant dissent or outlier outputs are automatically flagged.
  * **Adversarial Reviewer LLM** reviews these cases, drafting “minority reports” for all flagged results.

### 6. Quality Control, Error Tracking, and Transparency
* **QC LLM** re-inspects experiment results:
  * Verifies data completeness, type validity, and analytic diversity.
  * **Tracks and logs error rates** for both process and model (hallucination, divergence, failure to converge, etc.).
* **Explainability Layer:**
  * All analytic steps, rationale, and decision points are recorded and made available to researchers.
  * Researchers and auditors can interrogate “why” any decision/output was made.

### 7. Advanced Analysis & Consensus Evaluation
* **Analysis LLM Ensemble** executes the statistical, qualitative, or hybrid analyses as defined in the experiment.
  * Each LLM’s code and outputs are logged for transparency and reproducibility.
  * Unusual patterns, anomalies, or model disagreement trigger a *deeper adversarial review*.
* **Research Referee LLM**:
  * Synthesizes findings, but also assesses the presence/strength of consensus versus contestation.
  * All “minority reports,” error logs, and adversarial reviews are appended to the final analytic dossier.
  * If consensus is weak or dissent is meaningful, findings are explicitly presented as “contested,” not “settled.”

### 8. Deliverables and Knowledge Commons Integration
* All experiment assets—raw data, Jupyter notebooks, logs, explainability records, error rates, and both consensus and minority reports—are versioned and delivered to the researcher.
* **Optional:**
  * Significant new frameworks, anomalies, or analytic innovations are submitted for inclusion in the evolving Discernus master schema.
  * Metrics and process error rates are tracked over time to drive ongoing system improvement.

## Positioning
The Discernus workflow represents our *Thick LLM + Thin Software = Epistemic Trust* philosophy. By institutionalizing contestation, error tracking, adversarial review, and explainability at every step, Discernus makes the best of both human and machine strengths—setting a new standard for scientific rigor, pluralism, and transparency in LLM-driven research.
### Possible Refinements for Precision
* Consider a tagline version:“Thick LLM, Thin Software, Radical Transparency: The Discernus Epistemic Trust Model”
* Or, more sharply:“LLMs do the heavy lifting; software just keeps them honest. That’s Epistemic Trust, Discernus-style.”

## Discernus LLM-Augmented Research Process FAQ (Draft & Expansion)

### What is the core goal of the Discernus research platform?
Discernus aims to *structure, accelerate, and democratize high-quality analytic reasoning*—making advanced rhetorical and narrative analysis transparent, contestable, and repeatable at scale. The platform combines human insight, research-based frameworks, and modular LLM workflows to generate results that are rigorous, auditable, and open to critique.

### What makes Discernus’s approach different from “just running things through an LLM”?
Discernus doesn’t treat LLMs as oracles or black boxes. Every analysis is grounded in a published research schema, subjected to adversarial and minority-report review, and transparent at every analytic step. LLMs serve as amplifiers for explicit, human-driven frameworks—*not* as unaccountable decision-makers.

### How does Discernus address LLM “hallucinations” and errors?
Discernus systematically uses LLM ensembles, multi-step QC layers, and adversarial LLMs to detect, surface, and correct hallucinations and other errors. Outlier or divergent outputs trigger minority reports and additional review—not suppression or averaging away. All error rates are tracked and reported.

### Can LLMs really handle the complexity and subtlety of rhetorical analysis?
LLMs excel at pattern recognition and following precise instructions. While no model is perfect—especially with irony, ambiguity, or culture-bound nuances—the Discernus process leverages both LLM speed and human critical oversight. Subtle phenomena are addressed by requiring explicit, teachable definitions and adversarial testing.

### If LLM ratings sometimes diverge from human ratings, which is “right”?
Discernus makes both human and LLM reasoning explicit and contestable. The platform recognizes that neither is infallible: LLMs offer consistency and scalability; humans offer intuition and domain-specific expertise. Where differences arise, Discernus requires minority reports and invites critical dialogue—not forced agreement.

### How does Discernus prevent “groupthink” or systematic bias in LLM ensembles?
Ensemble results are never averaged blindly. Significant disagreement among LLMs triggers adversarial review, and dissenting outputs are flagged and documented. Discernus rewards the surfacing of anomalies, supporting epistemic pluralism and error detection over manufactured consensus.

### How does the platform ensure transparency and auditability?
Every analytic step, rationale, and decision point—human and machine—is logged and available for audit. Full code, prompt history, error logs, and “why” explanations are bundled with each experiment. This lets users, reviewers, or third parties trace outcomes back to first principles.

### How are frameworks and analytic strategies kept up-to-date and contestable?
Discernus maintains a living master schema, updated with new research and analytic frameworks as they emerge. Researchers can propose new schemas or contest existing ones. All frameworks are versioned, auditable, and subject to adversarial challenge.

### What happens when a framework or analysis fails, or results are inconclusive?
Failures are surfaced, not buried. Error conditions, non-converging results, and anomalies trigger additional review or remediation—not silent omission. Researchers receive full documentation, including process logs and dissenting views, for every experiment.

### Is Discernus only for academics, or can anyone use it?
Discernus is designed to be accessible to both professional researchers and motivated lay users. The platform’s rigor and transparency features make it suitable for education, journalism, policy, and civic discourse—not just academic publishing.

### How does Discernus handle data security and privacy?
User data and corpora are securely stored, versioned, and access-controlled. Sensitive content is managed in compliance with privacy and ethical guidelines. All analytic processes are transparent and auditable, but never at the expense of user privacy.

### What does a typical research process look like on Discernus?
* Researcher proposes an analytic framework and corpus.
* LLM Coach and Adversarial Reviewer assist with experimental design.
* Corpus is ingested, normalized, and quality-checked.
* LLM ensemble executes the experiment; all dissent and errors are tracked.
* Analysis ensemble synthesizes results; referee LLM assesses consensus.
* All outputs—including logs, minority reports, and explainability assets—are packaged for the researcher.

### Can Discernus frameworks be challenged or improved by the community?
Yes. Contestability and iterative improvement are core values. Any user can propose refinements, contest assumptions, or submit adversarial challenges to analytic frameworks. Accepted changes are tracked and publicly documented.

### How does Discernus compare to traditional research or content analysis platforms?
Discernus combines the rigor of manual expert analysis with the scalability and auditability of LLM-powered automation. Unlike traditional tools, it institutionalizes contestation, transparency, and pluralism, surfacing both consensus and dissent.

### What should I do if I find an error, anomaly, or bias in a Discernus experiment?
Report it through the platform’s contestation and feedback channels. Discernus treats error detection as a vital part of the knowledge creation process, rewarding users who help surface and diagnose faults.

### What about LLM bias or encoded values?**
*LLMs are trained on massive, culturally-embedded corpora, so bias is inevitable. Discernus addresses this by surfacing, not suppressing, disagreement—flagging minority and outlier outputs, and tracking where and how models diverge. No claim of “neutrality”—we document and debate our frameworks and results.*

### How do I know what the LLMs actually did?**
*Every analytic step, code output, and model decision is logged, explained, and versioned. You can audit the process, see why outputs were generated, and interrogate every step. Transparency is fundamental, not an afterthought.*

### What if the LLMs all agree, but they’re all wrong?
*Discernus does not equate consensus with correctness. We encourage adversarial review—agents and users are incentivized to find blind spots and propose “minority reports.” Statistical and qualitative checks surface cases where groupthink or model error could hide.*

### How does Discernus handle scale and error tracking?
*Because all process steps are logged and errors are systematically tracked, scaling up doesn’t mean scaling up risk blindly. We monitor error rates and publish metrics, so quality is always visible and improvable.*

### What if the process or models fail outright?
*Discernus is designed to detect, not conceal, failures. QC and adversarial agents flag experiments that fail to converge, run into ambiguous data, or encounter unanticipated complexity. Failures are logged, reported, and used for process improvement.*

### Isn’t this just automating away human expertise?
*Discernus amplifies human judgment, but never replaces it. Humans design frameworks, interpret results, and adjudicate contestation. LLMs do the mechanical processing—so humans can focus on what only humans can do: theory, intuition, and critique.*

### Final Takeaway:
*Discernus isn’t just an LLM platform—it’s a new epistemic operating system for collaborative, transparent, and contestable research. Every step is designed to maximize not just speed, but trust, accountability, and the capacity for collective learning.*
