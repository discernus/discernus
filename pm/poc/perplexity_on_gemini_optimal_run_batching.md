## Aggressively Batching Experimental Runs with Gemini 2.5 Pro: A Data-Driven Framework

### Strategic Rationale

Leveraging the Gemini 2.5 series for large-scale text analysis—especially in scenarios like political speech evaluation—yields maximum value when you combine a synthetic calibration phase, aggressive batching, and sequential sampling. This strategy delivers:

- **High analytical rigor** (tight error bounds, robust means)
- **Major cost and time savings** versus piecemeal or singly-batched evaluations
- **Scalability** to large corpora without sacrificing statistical reliability

### Step 1: Synthetic Representative Text Generation (with Gemini 2.5 Flash)

- Use Gemini 2.5 Flash’s ultra-large context window to ingest all source speeches and prompt the model to generate a “synthetic representative text.”
- This synthetic document statistically mirrors the full corpus’ rhetorical, structural, and stylistic elements[1][2].
- Running pilot evaluations on this synthetic text provides an empirical estimate of scoring variance with minimal resource investment.

### Step 2: Sequential Sampling with Gemini 2.5 Pro

- Sequentially sample the synthetic text through Gemini 2.5 Pro, increasing the run count until desired confidence and margin of error are met.
- Apply statistical stopping rules (e.g., sequential probability ratio testing—SPRT) to identify when further runs offer diminishing returns, optimizing both cost and accuracy[3][4].

### Step 3: Batched Analysis of Full Speech Corpus

- Use the variance findings from the synthetic calibration to set the required number of runs for reliable scoring of each speech.
- Batch as many speeches as possible into single Gemini 2.5 Pro requests, exploiting its 1M-token context window for maximal efficiency[5][6].
- This eliminates redundant overhead and benefits from context-aware reasoning across grouped documents.

## Quantifying the Safe Speech Count and Run Counts

### How Many 30-Minute Speeches Fit in the Gemini 2.5 Pro Context Window?

| Metric                        | Value                |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| Gemini 2.5 Pro context window | 1,000,000 tokens     |
| Avg. 30-minute speech         | 2,925 tokens         |
| **Maximum speeches/batch**    | **341**              |

*You can safely batch up to 341 speeches per request without exceeding the model's context window limits.*

### Optimal Run Count: Statistical Underpinnings

Estimate sample size needed for reliable mean scoring using the pilot variance (from synthetic representative text):

**Sample Size Formula:**
$$
n = \left(\frac{z \cdot \text{CV}}{E}\right)^2
$$
Where:
- $$ z $$ = 1.96 for 95% confidence
- $$ \text{CV} $$ = coefficient of variation (estimated from pilot, e.g., 2% or 0.02)
- $$ E $$ = desired margin of error (e.g., 1% or 0.01)

**Calculation Example:**
$$
n = \left(\frac{1.96 \times 0.02}{0.01}\right)^2 = (3.92)^2 = 15.37 \text{ (round up to 16)}
$$

**Result:**
- **Required runs per speech for reliable mean:** 16
- For a batch of 10 speeches: 160 runs in total

### Practical Table: Batch Capacity and Runs

| Parameter                 | Value         |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| Speech tokens each        | 2,925        |
| Batch size (max)          | 341          |
| Required runs per speech  | 16           |
| Example: 10 speeches      | 29,250 tokens|
| Total runs (10 speeches)  | 160          |

### Why This Approach Delivers Reliable, Cost-Effective Results

- **Synthetic Calibration Reduces Overkill:** By calibrating on a representative synthetic text, you avoid over-provisioning runs for low-variance corpora[1][2].
- **Sequential Sampling Avoids Diminishing Returns:** Techniques like SPRT or adaptive stopping cut off unnecessary runs when the model’s answers become statistically consistent, eliminating waste[3][7][4].
- **Aggressive Batching Exploits the Context Window:** Processing hundreds of speeches per request not only minimizes overhead but enables richer comparative analysis and cross-document pattern recognition—strengths of Gemini 2.5 Pro’s reasoning engine[6][5][8].
- **Quantitative Validation:** The mathematics ensure you meet desired statistical confidence and margin of error targets efficiently, without the need for conservative guesswork.

## Research and Real-World Evidence

- **Long-context resilience:** Gemini 2.5 Pro is validated in research and user testing to maintain state-of-the-art accuracy throughout million-token prompts—unmatched by prior LLMs[6][5][9].
- **Synthetic representative approaches** are increasingly recognized as effective for variance calibration across structurally similar corpora, especially when used in conjunction with large-context models[1][2].
- **Sequential probability ratio testing (SPRT)** and similar methods have been empirically shown to cut LLM evaluation costs by up to 75% in reasoning tasks by terminating early when results converge[3][7][4].

## Conclusion

**Aggressively batching runs in Gemini 2.5 Pro—after calibrating variance with a synthetic representative text from Gemini 2.5 Flash and using sequential/adaptive sampling—yields reliable, statistically robust mean scores at a fraction of traditional cost and time.** For most practical political speech analysis tasks, analysts can safely batch up to 341 speeches per request, with about 16 runs per speech (pilot-variance dependent), maximizing both model strengths and operational ROI[6][5][1][3][2][7][4][9].
