# Discernus THIN Redis Orchestration PoC

This directory contains documentation for the THIN Redis orchestration Proof of Concept implementation.

## Key Documents

### üìã [THIN_REDIS_POC_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](./THIN_REDIS_POC_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)
**Current implementation status and handoff documentation**
- Complete file inventory and architecture details
- Validation results from binary file processing
- Pending work and continuation instructions
- Environment setup and testing procedures

### üìê Original PoC Specification
**Location**: Previously at `pm/discernus_po_c_spec.md` (deleted during implementation)
**Key specs implemented**:
- Redis Streams for task coordination
- MinIO for content-addressable storage
- Thin router with stateless agents
- LLM-powered orchestration
- Binary-first architecture (no preprocessing)

## Quick Reference

**Branch**: `poc-redis-orchestration`  
**Status**: Core THIN architecture complete and validated  
**Next Phase**: Complete synthesis pipeline and production hardening

## Architecture Validation

‚úÖ **Proven**: LLMs can handle binary documents directly  
‚úÖ **Validated**: Framework/experiment/corpus agnostic infrastructure  
‚úÖ **Tested**: Real political documents (DOCX, PDF) processed successfully

## For New Agents

1. Read `THIN_REDIS_POC_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` first
2. Validate current system status using provided commands
3. Focus on synthesis agent implementation and caching logic
4. Stay on `poc-redis-orchestration` branch until PoC complete

*This PoC validates the core THIN principle: "LLMs can handle blobs directly" - eliminating the need for document preprocessing infrastructure.*
