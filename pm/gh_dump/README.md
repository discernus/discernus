## Notes

- **Initial Error**: The GitHub CLI was hitting pagination limits, showing only 30 issues instead of the actual 158
- **Correction Applied**: Used GitHub API with pagination to get all issues and their milestone assignments
- **Milestone Coverage**: 120 out of 130 open issues (92%) have proper milestone assignments
- **Stragglers**: 10 issues without milestone assignments are documented in stragglers.md
- **Most Active Areas**: Alpha Quality & Hygiene (40 issues) and Research & Development (38 issues) have the most open work
- **Detail Enhancement**: All issues now contain comprehensive information making them immediately actionable
- **Epic Coverage**: Complex epics include detailed implementation roadmaps, success criteria, and technical requirements
