# Discernus Ethical Use Framework

**Status:** Public-Facing Draft  
**Purpose:** To transparently communicate our commitment to fostering an ethical ecosystem and to detail the specific policies and programs we have in place to encourage responsible use of our powerful technology.

## Our Guiding Principle: Eyes Open

We believe that powerful tools require profound responsibility. The Discernus platform is designed to be a tool for understanding, a map for exploring the complex world of human discourse. However, we acknowledge that like any powerful tool, it has the potential for misuse.

We believe the only responsible path is to address this "dual-use" challenge head-on. We are not neutral bystanders. Our strategy is to actively and intentionally build an ecosystem that encourages and empowers ethical actors while creating friction and accountability for those who would misuse the tools.

This commitment is operationalized through a four-layered approach.

### 1. Transparency as the Best Defense

We believe that secrecy is the friend of the "dark arts." Our most powerful defense is the open and transparent nature of our core methodology.
-   **Open Standard:** The Discernus Coordinate System and Framework Specifications are open for public inspection and academic scrutiny. It is difficult to weaponize a methodology when the methods themselves are transparent.
-   **Academic Standards Board:** Our independent, academically-led governance board ensures that the standard evolves according to principles of scientific rigor, not the needs of any single commercial or political actor.
-   **Funding Proactive Research:** We are committed to actively using our own tools for good. We will seek to fund and promote academic research that uses the Discernus platform to *detect, map, and understand* disinformation and malicious influence campaigns, effectively turning our platform into an antibody for the information ecosystem.

### 2. The Ethical Use Affirmation Program

We want to empower the vast majority of our users who are committed to ethical research. To do this, we offer a voluntary, aspirational **"Ethical Use Affirmation."**
-   **The Pledge:** This is a simple, public pledge that users and customers can make to affirm their commitment to using the Discernus toolkit for ethical purposes—to advance understanding, not to create disinformation, incite hatred, or manipulate vulnerable populations.
-   **The Badge:** Signatories will be granted a license to use a specific **"Discernus - Ethically Affirmed"** badge on their publications, websites, and research materials. This allows ethical actors to signal their commitment and creates a "bright line" between them and those who would misuse the tools.
-   **Community Accountability:** This program is not policed by us; it is designed to create social proof and community-enforced accountability. By making a public pledge, signatories invite their peers, journalists, and the public to hold them to a higher standard.

### 3. Ethical Customer Vetting for Commercial Products

While the open-source tool is available to all, we have the absolute right and responsibility to choose our customers for our commercial products. This is our most direct lever for preventing misuse at scale.
-   **Sales Process:** We will build an ethical review process into our enterprise sales cycle for the `Discernus Cloud` and `Enterprise Server` products.
-   **Prohibited Use Cases:** We will not knowingly sell our commercial, high-scale products to organizations whose primary purpose is political disinformation, the promotion of hate speech, or other malicious activities that are fundamentally at odds with our mission to foster understanding.

### 4. Acceptable Use Policy in Licensing

Our software licenses will include a clear and enforceable Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). While this is a standard legal backstop, it formalizes our position and provides a legal basis for action in clear cases of abuse. The AUP will explicitly prohibit the use of the software for illegal activities, including but not limited to campaigns of targeted harassment, defamation, and the creation of fraudulent or deceptive content.

---

By combining these four layers—community transparency, a voluntary ethical pledge, direct commercial vetting, and a legal backstop—we aim to build a resilient ecosystem that is a powerful force for good, while being "eyes open" and prepared for the challenges ahead.
