- **Priority Updates**: As issues are resolved
- **New Items**: Add as discovered during development
- **Completion Criteria**: All acceptance criteria met and tested

## üèÜ SUCCESS: ARCH-002 Critical Regression Resolution

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Critical batch processing regression fully resolved using proven TDD methodology

**Issue**: `CleanAnalysisOrchestrator` was processing all documents in single batch LLM calls, violating THIN architecture principles

**Resolution**: Complete success using 6-phase Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- **Cost**: ~$13 total (vs $50+ for unstructured debugging)
- **Time**: 1 session with disciplined methodology  
- **Outcome**: Full restoration of individual processing with comprehensive testing

### üéØ TDD Protocol Success Factors

**What Made This Resolution Successful**:
1. **Immediate Documentation**: Issue logged in backlog prevented scope creep
2. **Sequential Phases**: Each phase built confidence before moving to next
3. **Mock-Based Testing**: 90% of debugging done without API costs
4. **Proven Patterns**: Importing working code was faster than rebuilding
5. **Cost Discipline**: Limited live testing prevented expensive debugging cycles

**Documentation Created**:
- ‚úÖ `docs/developer/TDD_CRITICAL_REGRESSION_PROTOCOL.md` - Comprehensive protocol
- ‚úÖ `.cursor/rules` - Updated with TDD methodology
- ‚úÖ `CURSOR_AGENT_QUICK_START.md` - Added critical regression protocol
- ‚úÖ `docs/developer/testing/README.md` - Referenced TDD approach

### üìã 6-Phase TDD Protocol (Proven Success Pattern)

1. **Unit Test Development**: Write focused tests validating regression patterns
2. **Path Bug Investigation**: Fix configuration/path issues with minimal changes  
3. **Core Implementation**: Implement fixes using proven patterns from working code
4. **Integration Testing**: Use mocks to verify end-to-end pipeline logic
5. **Limited Live Testing**: Create minimal 1-document experiments for validation
6. **Full Validation**: Rerun original experiments to confirm complete resolution

### üîÑ Future Critical Regressions

**Standard Operating Procedure**:
1. **IMMEDIATE STOP** - No live debugging or expensive API experiments
2. **Document Issue** - Log in this backlog with ARCH-XXX identifier
3. **Follow TDD Protocol** - Use proven 6-phase approach for cost-effective resolution
4. **Update Protocol** - Document new learnings for continuous improvement

**Documentation**: Complete v10 compliance implementation documented in DONE.md

### üöÄ **Next Priority: CLI v10 Compliance Fix**
**Goal**: Fix CLI v10 parsing and command functionality to enable v10 experiment execution

**Effort**: Medium (2-3 hours) - Can proceed once CLI-001 is complete
**Impact**: Enables all v10 experiments to run on current production pipeline

### üìã **Immediate Next Steps**
1. **Wait for CLI-001**: v10 parsing fix by other agent
2. **CLI-002 through CLI-008**: Fix remaining CLI issues and enhance functionality
