## üö® Critical Issues (Publication Blocking)

**COMPLETED CRITICAL ITEMS**: CRIT-006 ‚úÖ, CRIT-007 ‚úÖ, CRIT-008 ‚úÖ

#### [CRIT-008] Robust Path Resolution and Validation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Description**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Fixed "works on my machine" problems with robust filename matching
- **Impact**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Experiments now work reliably regardless of filename variations from git merges
- **Critical Issues**: ‚úÖ ALL RESOLVED
  - Fuzzy filename matching implemented (ignores hash suffixes automatically)
  - Corpus file existence validation added before experiment execution
  - Enhanced validation integration with clear logging
  - Supports exact, fuzzy, and extension-flexible matching
- **Results Achieved**:
  - Fuzzy matching: `john_mccain_2008_concession.txt` ‚Üí `john_mccain_2008_concession_ff9b26f2.txt`
  - Early validation: "STATUS: Corpus files validated" before analysis
  - 4/4 documents processed successfully (vs. 0/4 in broken state)
  - Git merge compatibility restored
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Robust path resolution operational and tested

#### [CRIT-009] Appropriate Reliability Metrics for Oppositional Frameworks
- **Description**: Replace Cronbach's Alpha with methodologically sound alternatives for frameworks that intentionally measure opposing constructs
- **Impact**: Current Cronbach's Alpha calculations are misleading for oppositional frameworks like CFF; negative alphas are expected and validate design rather than indicating failure
- **Critical Issues**:
  - Cronbach's Alpha assumes unidimensional constructs but CFF measures oppositional pairs
  - Negative alphas are incorrectly interpreted as reliability failures
  - Traditional psychometric reliability metrics don't apply to oppositional construct frameworks
  - Creates confusing "fancy metrics with no real relevance" in current reports
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Remove Cronbach's Alpha from current statistical analysis pipeline
  - Implement oppositional construct validation (negative correlation checks)
  - Add test-retest reliability for measurement stability
  - Add discriminant validity tests (opposing archetypes should differ significantly)
  - Add convergent validity tests (similar archetypes should cluster)
  - Reserve Cronbach's Alpha for ensemble inter-model reliability testing only
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Eliminates methodologically inappropriate metrics
- **Observed**: Enhanced synthesis correctly interprets negative alphas as validation, but metric shouldn't be calculated for oppositional constructs
