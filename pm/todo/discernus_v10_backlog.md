## Current Sprint Planning

### Sprint 1: Critical Fixes (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)

**Timeline:** 2-3 hours
**Goal:** Fix critical data integrity issues and unblock validation

#### [CRITICAL-001] Fix Graceful Degradation in Derived Metrics Phase âœ… **COMPLETED**

- **Description**: **CRITICAL BUG**: Derived metrics phase failures are being silently caught and the experiment continues with degraded results instead of failing fast
- **Dependencies**: None (blocking everything)
- **Root Cause**: Lines 197-201 in CleanAnalysisOrchestrator catch derived metrics failures and continue with `{"error": str(e), "status": "failed"}` instead of propagating the error
- **Evidence**: Terminal shows "Derived metrics phase failed, attempting to continue: Derived metrics functions file not found" but experiment completes successfully
- **Impact**: 
  - Masks critical LLM generation failures
  - Produces unreliable experiment results
  - Violates THIN architecture fail-fast principles
  - Makes debugging extremely difficult
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [x] Derived metrics phase failures cause immediate experiment termination
  - [x] Clear error messages indicate the specific failure point
  - [x] No graceful degradation for critical pipeline components
  - [x] Statistical analysis phase depends on derived metrics and should also fail if derived metrics fail
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Priority**: **CRITICAL** (data integrity issue)
- **Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Experiment now fails fast with exit code 1 and clear error message
- **Follow-up Issue**: Cache invalidation issue discovered - cached functions reference non-existent files

#### [CRITICAL-002] Fix Derived Metrics Cache Stale File References âœ… **COMPLETED**

- **Description**: **CRITICAL BUG**: Cached derived metrics functions reference temporary file paths that get cleaned up, causing "functions file not found" errors on cache hits
- **Dependencies**: [CRITICAL-001] âœ…
- **Root Cause**: Cache stores function metadata pointing to temporary workspace files, but temporary directories are cleaned up after each run (lines 769-772)
- **Evidence**: Cache hit shows "ðŸ’¾ Using cached derived metrics functions" but then fails with "Derived metrics functions file not found"
- **Solution**: Store actual function code content in cache, recreate function files from cached content when cache hit occurs
- **Impact**:
  - Cache hits cause experiment failures instead of performance improvements
  - Violates caching reliability principles
  - Makes development velocity worse instead of better
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [x] Cache stores actual function code content, not just metadata
  - [x] Cache hits recreate function files from stored content
  - [x] Both derived metrics and statistical analysis caches fixed
  - [x] Workspace cleanup doesn't break cached functions
- **Effort**: 1 hour âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Priority**: **CRITICAL** - Blocking caching benefits
- **Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Cache now stores and recreates function code content

#### [PERF-001] Implement Validation Caching âœ… **COMPLETED**

- **Description**: Implement caching for experiment coherence validation to eliminate redundant validation when input assets haven't changed
- **Dependencies**: [CRITICAL-002] âœ…
- **Root Cause**: Validation runs every time even when framework, experiment, and corpus haven't changed, causing unnecessary LLM calls and delays
- **Solution**: Cache validation results based on content hashes of framework, experiment, corpus, and model
- **Impact**:
  - Eliminates 20-30 second validation delays on repeated runs
  - Reduces LLM API costs for development iterations
  - Maintains same validation quality and error detection
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [x] ValidationCacheManager created with deterministic cache keys
  - [x] Cache key based on framework + experiment + corpus + model content
  - [x] Validation results cached with success/failure status and issues
  - [x] Cache hits skip validation and use stored results
  - [x] Failed validations properly cached and re-raise errors
  - [x] Unit tests cover all caching scenarios
  - [x] Integration with CleanAnalysisOrchestrator performance metrics
- **Effort**: 2 hours âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Priority**: **HIGH** - Significant development velocity improvement
- **Status**: âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - Validation now cached with 20-30 second speedup on cache hits

#### [TEST-INFRA] Fix Integration Test Infrastructure

- **Description**: Integration tests incorrectly mock critical setup, causing false failures
- **Impact**: False test failures prevent validation of all features
- **Root Cause**: Tests mock `_initialize_infrastructure` which bypasses `artifact_storage` setup
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Integration tests run without infrastructure errors
  - [ ] Tests accurately reflect actual system status
  - [ ] False failures are eliminated
  - [ ] Real issues (if any) are identified
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Priority**: **HIGHEST** - Blocking everything

#### [CRITICAL-003] Fix Silent Statistical Analysis Failures âœ… **COMPLETED**

- **Description**: **CRITICAL BUG**: Statistical analysis phase reports success but produces no numerical results, allowing experiments to continue to synthesis with invalid data
- **Dependencies**: [CRITICAL-001] âœ…, [CRITICAL-002] âœ…
- **Root Cause**: `_run_statistical_analysis_phase` method executes statistical functions but doesn't validate the output, blindly setting `"validation_passed": True`
- **Evidence**: Final report shows "While the analysis pipeline reported successful completion, the final output contained only metadata about the analysis run. It did not include the expected descriptive statistics or correlation coefficients."
- **Impact**:
  - Experiments produce invalid reports without statistical data
  - Violates fail-fast principles for critical pipeline components
  - Makes debugging extremely difficult when statistical analysis fails
  - Results in qualitative-only reports when quantitative analysis was intended
- **Solution**: Add validation to `_run_statistical_analysis_phase` using existing `_validate_statistical_results` method
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [x] Statistical analysis phase validates output before proceeding
  - [x] Experiments fail fast when statistical analysis produces no numerical results
  - [x] Clear error messages indicate statistical analysis failure
  - [x] No experiments proceed to synthesis without valid statistical data
- **Effort**: 30 minutes âœ… **COMPLETED**

#### [CACHE-001] RAG Index Caching Implementation âœ… **COMPLETED**

- **Description**: Implement caching for RAG indexes to eliminate redundant rebuilding and improve development velocity
- **Dependencies**: [THIN-OPT] âœ…
- **Root Cause**: RAG index rebuilt from scratch every time, even when evidence artifacts are identical, causing 10-15 second delays
- **Critical Fix Applied**: Fixed txtai directory-based index handling - txtai saves indexes as directories, not files, requiring tar.gz compression for caching
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [x] RAG index built and cached immediately after analysis phase (Phase 4.5)
  - [x] Cache key based on evidence artifact hashes for deterministic caching

#### [UX-001] Synthesis Flow Logging Cleanup âœ… **COMPLETED**

- **Description**: Fix synthesis phase logging order to improve readability and logical flow
- **Dependencies**: [TEST-003] âœ…
- **Root Cause**: `LocalArtifactStorage.get_artifact()` logs every evidence retrieval during synthesis and RAG index building, creating hundreds of verbose log lines
- **Solution**: Added `quiet=True` parameter to `get_artifact()` and updated all bulk evidence retrieval components
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [x] Evidence retrieval logging suppressed during bulk synthesis operations
  - [x] `UnifiedSynthesisAgent._get_all_evidence()` uses quiet mode
  - [x] `SynthesisPromptAssembler` uses quiet mode for evidence counting
  - [x] `CleanAnalysisOrchestrator._validate_synthesis_assets()` uses quiet mode for validation
