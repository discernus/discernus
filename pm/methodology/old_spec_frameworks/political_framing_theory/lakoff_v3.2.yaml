  Advanced Lakoff Family Models Framework testing George Lakoff's family model coherence 
  hypothesis through v3.2 competitive dynamics analysis and computational validation. This 
  framework examines whether political communications follow predicted clustering patterns 
  with competitive relationships between Strict Father and Nurturant Parent components.
  
  ## Theoretical Foundation
  
  Based on George Lakoff's groundbreaking work "Moral Politics," this framework tests the 
  hypothesis that political worldviews stem from coherent family models that generate 
  consistent positions across issues. Enhanced with v3.2 competitive dynamics modeling 
  and systematic framework comparison protocols.
  
  ### Core Theory: Family Models of Morality
  
  **Strict Father Model** - Politics as extension of strict father family structure:
  - **Authority/Discipline**: Strong moral authority, clear discipline, hierarchical decision-making
  - **Competition/Hierarchy**: Natural hierarchy, merit-based competition, individual achievement
  - **Self-Reliance**: Individual responsibility, self-determination, personal accountability
  
  **Nurturant Parent Model** - Politics as extension of nurturant parent family structure:
  - **Empathy/Communication**: Empathetic understanding, inclusive dialogue, communication-based problem solving
  - **Cooperation/Mutual Support**: Egalitarian cooperation, shared responsibility, collective problem-solving
  - **Interdependence**: Collective responsibility, social connection, mutual dependence as foundation
  
  ## v3.2 Capabilities
  
  - **Competitive Dynamics**: Mathematical modeling of family model competition and dilution effects
  - **Arc Clustering Validation**: Quantitative testing of Lakoff's clustering predictions
  - **Framework Fit Metrics**: Cartographic fidelity for family model coherence assessment
  - **Temporal Evolution**: Family model stability and evolution pattern tracking
  - **Olympics Protocols**: Systematic comparison with other political frameworks
  - **Density Modeling**: Semantic space allocation for family model territories
  
  ## Methodological Innovation
  
  ### Arc Clustering Hypothesis Testing
  This framework tests Lakoff's predictions through circular geometry analysis with v3.2 enhancements:
  - **Strict Father Arc**: Components clustered on left arc (315° to 45°) with competitive dynamics
  - **Nurturant Parent Arc**: Components clustered on right arc (135° to 225°) with mutual reinforcement
  - **180° Separation**: Family models geometrically opposed with competition modeling
  - **Clustering Coefficient**: Quantitative measure with temporal stability tracking
  
  ### Competitive Family Model Dynamics
  Enhanced with v3.2 competitive relationship modeling:
  - **Zero-sum competition** between family model components
  - **Dilution effects** when both models activated simultaneously
  - **Coherence violation detection** for strategic messaging analysis
  - **Temporal stability** of family model dominance patterns
  
  ## Research Applications
  
  ### Empirical Validation Questions
  - Do political communications actually follow family model clustering patterns?
  - How do competitive dynamics affect family model coherence?
  - Can family model positioning predict positions on new issues?
  - What is the temporal stability of family model coherence under competition?
  
  ### Advanced Analytics
  - Mixed messaging detection with competition analysis
  - Cross-cluster activation patterns and dilution measurement
  - Family model purity assessment with competitive adjustment
  - Predictive validation with temporal evolution tracking

    You are an expert in cognitive linguistics and political psychology, specializing 
    in George Lakoff's family model theory and competitive dynamics analysis. You have 
    deep knowledge of how Strict Father and Nurturant Parent worldviews manifest 
    in political discourse and compete for cognitive dominance through specific 
    language patterns and conceptual metaphors.

    Analyze this text to identify components of Lakoff's family models with special 
    attention to competitive relationships: Authority/Discipline, Competition/Hierarchy, 
    Self-Reliance (Strict Father) versus Empathy/Communication, Cooperation/Mutual Support, 
    Interdependence (Nurturant Parent). Test whether these components cluster as predicted 
    and identify competitive dynamics between family models.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for family model coherence patterns, competitive dynamics, and co-activation 
    of Strict Father components versus Nurturant Parent components as predicted by theory. 
    Detect coherence violations, strategic mixing, and competitive dilution effects. 
    Analyze zero-sum competition between family model worldviews.
