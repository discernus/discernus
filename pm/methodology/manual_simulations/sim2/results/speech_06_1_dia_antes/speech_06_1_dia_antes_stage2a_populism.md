- **Technical competence** balances populist anti-establishment sentiment

The combination of **moderate populism + inclusive governance + technical competence** creates a sophisticated electoral appeal that maintains populist foundation while appealing to broader democratic coalition.

### FRAMEWORK VALIDATION

This case demonstrates:
- **Tactical variation** within same candidate based on electoral timing
- **Moderation effects** of final electoral appeals on populist intensity
- **Contextual sensitivity** - governance preparation moderates confrontational populism
- **Strategic sophistication** - populist foundation with inclusive democratic governance

The framework successfully captures how electoral timing and strategic considerations can moderate populist intensity while maintaining grassroots movement legitimacy.

### COMPARATIVE PATTERN

**1 Dia Antes vs Previous Speeches:**
- **Araçatuba (0.6)**: Moderate Populism - focused but not confrontational
- **Porto Velho (0.0)**: No Populism - coalition building approach
- **Juiz de Fora (0.3)**: Low Populism - technocratic efficiency focus

This reveals **strategic moderation** effect:
