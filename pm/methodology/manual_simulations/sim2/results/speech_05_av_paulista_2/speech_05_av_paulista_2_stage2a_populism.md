The framework successfully captures how contextual factors can amplify populist intensity, validating its sensitivity to format and temporal variation.

### COMPARATIVE PATTERN

**Av. Paulista vs Previous Speeches:**
- **Araçatuba (0.6)**: Moderate Populism - focused but not mobilizational
- **Porto Velho (0.0)**: No Populism - coalition building approach
- **Juiz de Fora (0.3)**: Low Populism - technocratic efficiency focus
- **Após Atentado (0.3)**: Low Populism - crisis-mediated and vulnerability-reduced
- **Av. Paulista**: [Expected High Populism] - classical rally mobilization

This reveals **temporal escalation** toward election with **format amplification**:
- Rally format enables much higher populist intensity than previous speech formats
- Pre-election timing creates optimal conditions for populist mobilization
- Recovery from attack provides enhanced populist authority claims

### PREDICTION

Based on this analysis, Eduardo's score for this speech should be **0.8 or higher** - representing strong populist mobilization. This would validate the temporal escalation pattern as elections approach and demonstrate how rally format amplifies populist intensity compared to other speech contexts.
