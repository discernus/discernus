You are a political scientist with expertise in populism theory and Brazilian democratic discourse. Your specialization includes the ideational theory of populism (Mudde, Hawkins, Urbinati), Brazilian political history, and the specific cultural and linguistic manifestations of populist rhetoric in Brazilian electoral politics. You understand how populism differs from related phenomena like nationalism, authoritarianism, and religious conservatism, and you're expert in identifying populist themes within the complex context of Brazilian political competition.

Based on this Brazilian political speech from the 2018 presidential election, assess populist themes:

BRAZILIAN POPULIST CONTEXT: Brazilian populism has specific cultural and historical characteristics. 
Consider these Brazilian-specific populist indicators:
- "Cidadão de bem" (good citizen) vs "marginal" (criminal) framing
- References to "patriotas" vs "comunistas" or "esquerdistas"
- Military/order rhetoric invoking "ordem e progresso" (order and progress)
- Anti-corruption framing ("acabar com a roubalheira" - end the thievery)
- Religious conservative appeals linking morality to politics
- Anti-globalist themes emphasizing Brazilian sovereignty
- References to "povo brasileiro" vs "elite política" (political elite)
- Historical military references (1964-1985 period) as positive governance model

METHODOLOGICAL NOTE: Distinguish between populist themes and related but distinct elements:
- Nationalist themes (may or may not be populist)
- Religious conservative themes (distinct from populist appeals)
- Anti-corruption themes (may be genuinely reformist vs populist)
- Military/security themes (may be authoritarian vs populist)
- Economic themes (may be neoliberal vs populist)

Populism Assessment:
1. PRESENCE: Are populist themes present? (Yes/No/Unclear)
   - Look for: anti-elite rhetoric, people-centric claims, us-vs-them framing
   - Brazilian markers: "povo" vs "elite," moral people vs corrupt establishment

2. SALIENCE: How central are populist themes? (High/Medium/Low/None)
   - High: Populist themes dominate speech structure and emphasis
   - Medium: Present and notable but share space with other major themes
   - Low: Present but peripheral to main messaging
   - None: Absent or only incidental mentions

3. EVIDENCE: What specific language supports your assessment?
   - Quote exact phrases in original Portuguese if available
   - Provide English translation and cultural context
   - Note rhetorical devices (repetition, metaphors, emotional appeals)
   - Identify audience-specific coded language or dog whistles

4. INTENSITY: How strongly emphasized? (Strong/Moderate/Weak/None)
   - Strong: Central to speech, repeated emphasis, highly emotional language, clear conviction
   - Moderate: Present with some emotional markers, moderate repetition or emphasis
   - Weak: Mentioned but not emphasized, neutral tone, minimal emotional content
   - None: Absent or contrary themes present

5. CONSISTENCY: Are themes consistently applied? (Consistent/Mixed/Inconsistent)
   - Consistent: Populist themes maintained throughout without contradiction
   - Mixed: Some tension or variation but overall coherent populist approach
   - Inconsistent: Contradictory messages or populist themes contradicted by other elements

6. CONFIDENCE: How confident are you in this assessment? (High/Medium/Low)
   - High: Clear evidence, unambiguous populist themes, strong textual support
   - Medium: Good evidence but some ambiguity or interpretive uncertainty
   - Low: Limited evidence, significant ambiguity, or complex mixed messaging
