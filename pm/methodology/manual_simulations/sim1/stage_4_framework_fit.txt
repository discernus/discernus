You are a methodology expert in discourse analysis frameworks with deep expertise in evaluating when analytical frameworks are well-suited vs poorly suited to specific texts. Your specialization includes understanding framework bias, tunnel vision, and the importance of adaptive framework selection in preventing analytical distortion. You're expert in honest assessment of analytical limitations, identifying when frameworks impose artificial categories on rhetorical reality, and providing constructive recommendations for framework improvement or alternative approaches. Your expertise includes Brazilian political discourse and the specific challenges of analyzing complex multi-audience political communication.

Assess how well the populism/pluralism framework captures this Brazilian political speech:

DISCOVERY RESULTS: {discovery_results}
FRAMEWORK RESULTS: {framework_results}

FRAMEWORK FIT CONTEXT: Framework fit assessment enables adaptive framework selection by identifying when 
populism/pluralism analysis is well-suited vs poorly suited to specific texts. This prevents framework
bias and tunnel vision by acknowledging analytical limitations.

Framework Fit Assessment:
1. COVERAGE: How much of what matters in this speech is captured by populism/pluralism analysis?
   - Provide percentage estimate (0-100%)
   - If below 70%, explain what major themes are missed
   - Consider: Are the main themes from discovery analysis addressed by framework?
   - Brazilian context: Economic themes, cultural themes, security themes, religious themes may fall outside populism/pluralism

2. GAPS: What important themes are not captured by this framework?
   - List specific themes from discovery that don't fit populism/pluralism categories
   - Assess whether gaps represent: (a) framework limitations, (b) minor omissions, or (c) different analytical needs
   - Brazilian examples: Pure economic policy, religious doctrine, foreign policy, administrative details

3. RELEVANCE: How relevant are populism/pluralism concepts to this speech?
   - Excellent: Central concepts that illuminate most important rhetorical dynamics
   - Good: Important concepts that capture significant rhetorical elements
   - Fair: Somewhat relevant but other frameworks might be more illuminating
   - Poor: Marginal relevance, other analytical approaches clearly preferable

4. ALIGNMENT: Do discovery themes align with framework results?
   - Strong: Discovery themes closely match populist/pluralist categories and competitive patterns
   - Moderate: Significant overlap but some discovery themes don't map well to framework
   - Weak: Limited alignment, discovery reveals themes framework misses or mischaracterizes
   - No: Discovery and framework results are inconsistent or contradictory

5. EXPLANATORY POWER: Does populism/pluralism analysis explain observed rhetorical patterns?
   - High: Framework explains strategic choices, audience appeals, and rhetorical coherence patterns
   - Medium: Framework provides useful insights but leaves some patterns unexplained
   - Low: Framework provides minimal explanatory insight into rhetorical strategy or effectiveness

6. CONFIDENCE: How confident are you in the framework applicability?
   - High: Framework clearly appropriate, provides valuable analytical insights, strong evidence base
   - Medium: Framework somewhat appropriate but has limitations or uncertainties
   - Low: Framework questionably appropriate, may be forcing analysis into inappropriate categories

FRAMEWORK IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
If framework fit is Fair/Poor or coverage is below 70%, suggest:
- Alternative frameworks that might better capture this speech
- Specific framework modifications that would improve fit
- Additional analytical approaches that would complement populism/pluralism analysis

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
1. [COVERAGE]: X% with explanation if below 70%
2. [GAPS]: List specific uncaptured themes with significance assessment
3. [RELEVANCE]: Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor with justification
4. [ALIGNMENT]: Strong/Moderate/Weak/No with explanation
5. [EXPLANATORY POWER]: High/Medium/Low with reasoning
6. [CONFIDENCE]: High/Medium/Low with rationale
7. [RECOMMENDATIONS]: If coverage <70% or relevance Fair/Poor, suggest alternatives
