### Framework Fit Assessment Results

**1. [COVERAGE]: 85%**

The populism/pluralism framework captures most of what matters in this speech. The high coverage reflects how effectively populist analysis captures the dominant rhetorical strategy and competitive dynamics. **Breakdown**:

**Themes Fully Captured (60%)**:
- **Anti-establishment identity** → Perfectly fits populist "people vs. elite" framework
- **Religious values** → Successfully integrated as populist moral authority vs. elite corruption
- **Economic nationalism** → Captured as populist "people's resources vs. global elites"

**Themes Substantially Captured (25%)**:
- **Military heritage** → Well-captured through populist credibility analysis, though some authoritarian elements extend beyond pure populism
- **Law and order** → Effectively analyzed as populist "people's security vs. elite chaos," though institutional critique adds complexity

**Minor Coverage Gaps (15%)**:
- Technical policy details on education, agriculture, and infrastructure 
- Specific regional Brazilian political dynamics
- Personal biographical elements serving narrative rather than populist purposes

**2. [GAPS]: List specific uncaptured themes with significance assessment**

**Minor Gaps - Framework Limitations**:

**1. Brazilian Regional Politics (5% significance)**
- Specific Northeast/South dynamics ("nordestinos e sulistas")
- Regional economic references (Vale do Ribeira, Roraima development)

**2. Technical Policy Content (5% significance)**
- Agricultural technology details (Israel agricultural cooperation)
- Educational curriculum specifics ("sem ideologia de gênero")
- Infrastructure development plans
- Assessment: **Minor omission** - policy details serve populist narrative but have technical content beyond framework scope

**3. Personal Biography Narrative (3% significance)**
- Family history details (father's Palmeiras fandom, mother's pregnancy)
- Military career specifics (promotion history, disciplinary actions)
- Assessment: **Different analytical needs** - biographical elements serve populist credibility but require narrative analysis methods

**4. Administrative Governance Details (2% significance)**
- Specific ministry organization plans
- Appointment process mechanics
- Assessment: **Minor omission** - governance details serve populist "competency vs. politics" theme but extend to administrative specifics

**No Major Gaps Identified**: All significant rhetorical themes are captured within populism/pluralism competitive analysis.

**3. [RELEVANCE]: Excellent**
