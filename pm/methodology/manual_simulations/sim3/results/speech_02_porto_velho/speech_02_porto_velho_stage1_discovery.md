The themes form a **coherent populist-nationalist synthesis** where:

**Security/Order themes** serve as **practical implementation** of traditional values and popular unity, presenting law enforcement as protectors of both moral order and national cohesion.

**Economic Development** is positioned as **instrumental** to achieving national greatness and popular prosperity, subordinated to moral and nationalist goals but essential for their realization.

The synthesis creates a **moral-nationalist package** where supporting the candidate becomes both a patriotic duty and a moral imperative, with economic prosperity following from moral and political renewal.

[EVIDENCE: "Me inspiro na minha filha de sete anos de idade. Eu quero deixar o Brasil pra ela diferente do que nós temos hoje. Um Brasil seguro. Um país que seja respeitado lá fora. Um país onde a família realmente seja a base da nossa sociedade" / "I'm inspired by my seven-year-old daughter. I want to leave Brazil different for her than what we have today. A safe Brazil.
