- Local political network coordination
- Regional party dynamics and coalition building
- **Analysis**: Framework captures populist integration but specific alliance mechanics partially beyond democratic theory scope

## Analytical Limitations

### 1. **Framework Limitations Identified**

**Regional Specificity:**
- Framework accommodates regional integration but may not fully capture economic and cultural specificity that operates independently of populist/pluralist dynamics
- Local political relationships may have dimensions beyond democratic theory

**Strategic Sophistication:**
- Framework captures strategic evolution but may not fully address the complexity of tactical adaptation within consistent anti-pluralist framework
- Coalition-building sophistication may require more nuanced analytical tools

**Extended Format Analysis:**
- Rally format creates complexity that challenges single-speech analysis framework
- Multiple speakers and extended timeframe may require modified analytical approach

### 2. **Methodological Limitations**

**Rally Format Complexity:**
- Extended format with multiple speakers challenges individual speech analysis methodology
- Performance elements may require different analytical framework
- Crowd interaction dynamics may extend beyond textual analysis

**Regional Context Depth:**
- Rondônia-specific context may require deeper regional political analysis
- Economic specificity may need specialized policy analysis beyond democratic theory

**Strategic Evolution Assessment:**
- Comparison with Araçatuba reveals tactical evolution that may require longitudinal rather than snapshot analysis
- Strategic sophistication may benefit from campaign-wide rather than individual speech analysis

### 3. **Theoretical Limitations**

**Coalition Analysis:**
- Framework may not fully capture complexity of coalition-building that maintains anti-pluralist character
- Strategic sophistication within populist framework may require theoretical expansion

**Regional Integration:**
- Local interest integration into populist framework may require more sophisticated analytical tools
- Brazilian regional diversity may challenge unified populist/pluralist framework application
