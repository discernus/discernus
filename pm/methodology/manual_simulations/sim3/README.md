# SIM3: CLEAN COORDINATE-FREE VALIDATION EXPERIMENT
## Corrected Version with Proper Blind Analysis Protocol
### Date: 2025-01-01

## WHAT THIS IS

This is the **corrected version** of the coordinate-free discourse analysis validation experiment, designed to eliminate the methodological contamination discovered in sim2.

## CONTAMINATION CORRECTION

**Problem in sim2**: Eduardo scores were visible to the LLM during analysis, invalidating empirical validation claims.

**Solution in sim3**: 
- Clean corpus files without target scores
- Blind analysis protocol 
- Validation scores held separately until post-analysis
- Fresh agent without contamination

```

## EXPERIMENTAL INTEGRITY

- **Blind Analysis**: No target knowledge during analysis
- **Clean Materials**: All contamination removed
- **Genuine Validation**: Real predictive testing
- **Fresh Agent**: No exposure to previous contaminated experiment

**Status**: Setup in progress - preparing for genuine empirical validation
