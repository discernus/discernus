  accuracy while discovering revolutionary theoretical patterns.

# ================================================================
# RESEARCH QUESTIONS & HYPOTHESES (REVISED FOR ACTUAL STUDY)
# ================================================================

research_questions:
  primary: "Can coordinate-free discourse analysis accurately predict expert human assessments of political discourse?"
  
  secondary:
    - "Does multi-stage coordinate-free analysis reveal distinct democratic discourse patterns?"
    - "Do discovery-first approaches identify themes missed by framework-first analysis?"
    - "Can framework fit assessment accurately identify when analysis is appropriate?"
    - "Does coordinate-free analysis enable systematic theoretical breakthroughs?"
