display_name: "Populism vs Pluralism Framework (Coordinate-Free)"

description: |
  The Populism vs Pluralism Framework analyzes the fundamental tension between populist and 
  pluralist approaches to democratic governance using a coordinate-free analytical model.
  
  This framework implements the new multi-stage analysis approach:
  1. **Discovery Analysis** - Open-ended characterization without framework bias
  2. **Independent Anchor Assessment** - Presence, salience, and evidence evaluation
  3. **Competitive Relationship Analysis** - How populism and pluralism interact
  4. **Coherency Assessment** - Strategic messaging patterns and narrative consistency
  5. **Framework Fit Assessment** - How well this framework captures rhetorical reality

  ## Coordinate-Free Architecture
  
  **No Spatial Positioning**: Anchors are conceptual tools, not coordinate positions
  **Multi-Dimensional Profiles**: Preserve individual anchor detail without averaging
  **Competition as Coherency**: Opposition modeling reveals strategic patterns, not constraints
  **Discovery-First**: Framework fit assessment reduces framework bias
