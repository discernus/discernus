- **Current**: Basic session logging
- **Needed**: Publication-ready replication packages with all assets
- **Gap**: Comprehensive documentation generation and packaging

### Integration Challenges

#### 1. Simple Prompting ‚Üí Existing Infrastructure
- **Challenge**: Connect Gemini-style prompting to our THIN orchestration
- **Complexity**: Medium - requires orchestrator modification without losing existing capabilities

#### 2. Real-Time Monitoring Integration
- **Challenge**: Add live researcher interface to current web system
- **Complexity**: High - requires WebSocket implementation or similar for real-time updates

#### 3. Database Schema Extension
- **Challenge**: Support checkpoint data, pause states, and validation results
- **Complexity**: Medium - schema updates with migration strategy

#### 4. Checkpoint State Management
- **Challenge**: Persist analysis state for pause/resume functionality
- **Complexity**: High - requires sophisticated state management and recovery

## Conclusion

**We have substantially more than we initially thought.** Our THIN infrastructure, documentation, data assets, and development environment provide a strong foundation. The key insight is that we don't need to rebuild everything - we need to **add the missing control and validation layers** while **simplifying our prompting approach**.

**The strategic pivot is achievable because:**
1. Our infrastructure can support simple prompting alongside existing complexity
2. Our CARA methodology provides quality frameworks that just need adaptation
3. Our data assets are ready for immediate testing
4. Our development environment enables rapid iteration

**The critical path is proving that simple prompting works in our environment, then building the researcher control systems that make the process trustworthy at scale.**
