- **Milestone**: Alpha Release Close Down
- **Description**: Epic: Strategic Unit Testing for Discernus Research Platform

**Full Description**:
# Epic: Strategic Unit Testing for Discernus Research Platform

## Overview

Design and implement a focused unit testing strategy for Discernus that tests what actually matters for a research platform, not just what's easy to test. Focus on deterministic functions that can break silently and cause research failures.

## Strategic Context

**Current State**: Scattered tests focused on development iteration, not regression prevention
**Target State**: Focused unit tests that catch research-critical failures
**Triage Strategy**: Must-have (research breaks) → Should-have (quality) → Nice-to-have (coverage)

## What Unit Tests Make Sense for Discernus?

### Must-Have (Research Breaks - Fix First)
**Critical functions that can cause silent research failures:**

1. **Framework Validation** (High Impact)
   - Framework schema parsing and validation
   - Required field checking (dimensions, prompts, variants)
   - Version compatibility validation
   - JSON appendix extraction and validation
   - **Why**: Invalid frameworks cause entire experiments to fail

2. **Statistical Calculations** (High Impact)
   - Math toolkit functions (ANOVA, correlations, effect sizes)
   - Score validation (0.0-1.0 range checking)
   - Statistical significance calculations
   - **Why**: Wrong statistics invalidate research results

3. **Data Validation** (High Impact)
   - Score range validation (0.0-1.0)
   - Evidence quotation validation
   - JSON schema compliance
   - **Why**: Invalid data corrupts research findings

### Should-Have (Quality Assurance)
**Functions that improve reliability and debugging:**

4. **Corpus Management** (Medium Impact)
   - Corpus loading and validation
   - Document metadata extraction
   - File format handling
   - Corpus manifest validation
   - **Why**: Corpus issues cause experiment failures

5. **Experiment Lifecycle** (Medium Impact)
   - Experiment configuration validation
   - State management and persistence
   - Resume functionality
   - **Why**: Experiment state issues break reproducibility

6. **Error Handling** (Medium Impact)
   - Graceful failure modes
   - Error recovery mechanisms
   - Edge case handling
   - **Why**: Prevents cascading failures

### Nice-to-Have (Coverage)
**Functions that are good to test but not critical:**

7. **Agent Mocking** (Low Impact)
   - Mock LLM responses for agent testing
   - Agent coordination validation
   - **Why**: Complex to mock, integration tests may be better

8. **Performance Tests** (Low Impact)
   - Response time validation
   - Memory usage optimization
   - **Why**: Performance is separate from correctness

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Must-Have Tests (3-4 days)
**Focus on what breaks research:**

1. **Framework Validation Tests**
   ```python
   # test_framework_validation.py
   - test_framework_schema_validation()
   - test_required_fields_present()
   - test_version_compatibility()
   - test_json_appendix_extraction()
   - test_invalid_framework_handling()
   ```

2. **Statistical Calculation Tests**

   - test_score_range_validation()
   - test_evidence_quotation_validation()
   - test_json_schema_compliance()
   - test_malformed_data_handling()
   ```

### Phase 2: Should-Have Tests (2-3 days)
**Focus on reliability:**

4. **Corpus Management Tests**
   ```python
   # test_corpus_management.py
   - test_corpus_loading()
   - test_metadata_extraction()
   - test_file_format_handling()
   - test_manifest_validation()
   ```

5. **Experiment Lifecycle Tests**
   ```python
   # test_experiment_lifecycle.py
   - test_configuration_validation()
   - test_state_management()
   - test_resume_functionality()
   - test_error_recovery()
   ```

### Phase 3: Nice-to-Have Tests (1-2 days)
**Focus on coverage:**

6. **Agent Mocking Tests**
   ```python
   # test_agent_mocks.py
   - test_llm_response_mocking()
   - test_agent_coordination()
   - test_error_propagation()
   ```

## Test Design Principles

### What to Test
- **Deterministic Functions**: Mathematical calculations, data validation, parsing
- **Critical Paths**: Framework validation, corpus loading, statistical analysis
- **Error Conditions**: Invalid inputs, malformed data, edge cases
- **Silent Failures**: Functions that can fail without obvious errors

### What NOT to Test
- **LLM Conversations**: Too complex, flaky, better for integration tests
- **End-to-End Workflows**: That's integration testing territory
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Separate concern from correctness
- **UI/UX Elements**: Not applicable to research platform

### Mock Strategy
- **LLM Responses**: Use realistic mock responses from actual experiments
- **File System**: Use temporary files and cleanup
- **Network Calls**: Mock API responses with known data
- **External Dependencies**: Mock only what's necessary

## Success Criteria

### Must-Have Success (Alpha Quality Blockers)
- [ ] All framework validation tests pass
- [ ] All statistical calculation tests pass

- [ ] Test coverage ≥ 70% for critical modules

### Nice-to-Have Success (Future)
- [ ] Agent mocking tests implemented
- [ ] Performance tests implemented
- [ ] Test coverage ≥ 80% overall

## Triage Strategy

### If Time Runs Short (Priority Order)
1. **Must-Have Tests Only**: Framework validation, statistical calculations, data validation
2. **Add Should-Have**: Corpus management, experiment lifecycle
3. **Add Nice-to-Have**: Agent mocking, performance tests

### Minimum Viable Testing
- Framework validation (prevents experiment failures)
- Statistical calculations (prevents research errors)
- Data validation (prevents corrupted results)

**Full Description**:
# Epic: Automated Integration Gauntlet with Meaningful Results Validation

## Overview

Create an automated integration testing system that runs the complete experiment gauntlet (Simple Test → Series 1 → Series 2 → Series 3) with systematic validation of meaningful results, not just experiment completion. The system must distinguish between technical success (experiment completed) and research success (meaningful, valid results produced).

## Problem Statement

Current testing focuses on experiment completion rather than result quality. This leads to:
- False positives where experiments "complete" but produce malformed/bizarre output
- Celebration of technical success while ignoring research value
- Missed validation of actual framework performance and data quality
- Inadequate detection of LLM hallucination or framework parsing failures

## Strategic Context

**Current State**: Manual gauntlet execution with subjective result assessment
**Target State**: Automated gauntlet with systematic validation of meaningful results
**Impact**: Ensures Alpha Quality & Hygiene milestone produces reliable, validated research platform

## Integration Test Suite

### Simple Test (Fast Validation)
- **Purpose**: Rapid architecture validation
- **Framework**: CFF v7.3 (Cohesive Flourishing)
- **Corpus**: 2 documents (McCain concession vs Sanders critique)

- [ ] **Framework Compliance**: Results conform to framework specifications
- [ ] **Statistical Rigor**: Proper statistical tests applied with correct interpretations
- [ ] **Report Quality**: Academic-level reporting with methodology and interpretation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Validation Framework (3-4 days)
1. **Create Validation Classes**
   - `TechnicalSuccessValidator`: Pipeline execution, file generation, performance
   - `ResearchSuccessValidator`: Score quality, statistical significance, evidence validation
   - `QualityAssuranceValidator`: Hallucination detection, framework compliance

2. **Define Success Criteria Per Experiment**
   - Simple Test: McCain vs Sanders differentiation, CFF score validation
   - Series 1: Framework-specific validation (CAF dimensions, CHF heuristics, ECF patterns)
   - Series 2: Multi-dimensional analysis, factorial design validation
   - Series 3: Performance metrics, reliability under load

### Phase 2: Automation Script (2-3 days)
1. **Create `scripts/run_integration_gauntlet.py`**
   - Sequential execution of all experiments
   - Real-time progress reporting
   - Error capture and categorization
   - Performance metrics collection

2. **Implement Severity Classification**
   - **Critical**: Pipeline failures, malformed output, hallucination
   - **High**: Statistical significance failures, effect size issues
   - **Medium**: Evidence quality problems, score distribution issues
   - **Low**: Minor formatting issues, performance optimizations

### Phase 3: Reporting System (1-2 days)
1. **Comprehensive Report Generation**
   - Technical success summary
   - Research success validation
   - Quality assurance results
   - Performance metrics
   - Severity-ranked issue list

2. **Integration with GitHub Issues**
   - Automatic issue creation for critical/high severity problems
   - Tagged with appropriate labels and milestones
   - Clear reproduction steps and expected vs actual results

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] All experiments execute without pipeline errors
- [ ] Performance meets targets (Simple Test < 1 minute, Series 3 < 30 minutes)
- [ ] Cost remains within budget (< $1.00 total for full gauntlet)
- [ ] All output files generated with valid schemas

### Research Success
- [ ] Framework scores show meaningful differentiation between test cases
- [ ] Statistical tests produce significant results where hypotheses predict
- [ ] Evidence quotations genuinely support assigned scores
- [ ] Reports contain proper methodology and interpretation
- [ ] No hallucination or malformed output detected

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Score distributions show appropriate variance (not all 0.5)
- [ ] Framework compliance validated for all experiments
- [ ] Statistical rigor maintained across all analyses
