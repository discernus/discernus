# SOAR Project Structure Specification v1.0
## Standardized Directory Format for Simple Atomic Orchestration Research

**Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 1 Specification  
**Philosophy**: Framework-agnostic project organization for computational research

---

## Overview

The SOAR project structure provides a standardized, framework-agnostic format for organizing computational research projects. This structure enables the SOAR system to validate, execute, and manage research projects consistently across different analytical frameworks and research domains.

**Design Principles**:
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any analytical framework (CFF, MFT, custom frameworks)
- **Self-Contained**: Each project contains everything needed for analysis and reproduction
- **Validation Ready**: Structure supports comprehensive validation using existing rubrics
- **Results Integration**: Clear separation between input and output components

## Implementation Guidelines

### **For Researchers**
1. **Start with Structure**: Create the three required files before analysis
2. **Framework First**: Ensure framework.md passes validation before proceeding
3. **Clear Hypotheses**: Write specific, testable hypotheses in experiment.md
4. **Corpus Quality**: Ensure corpus is representative and well-documented

### **For Developers**
1. **Validation Order**: Structure → Framework → Experiment → Corpus
2. **Framework Agnostic**: Never hardcode framework-specific logic
3. **Error Messaging**: Provide clear guidance for structural issues
4. **Results Preservation**: Always save results in timestamped directories

### **For SOAR System**
1. **Validation Enforcement**: No execution without successful validation
2. **Framework Loading**: Use FrameworkLoader for all framework operations
3. **Results Integration**: Save all outputs in standardized results structure
4. **Metadata Tracking**: Complete provenance for reproducibility

---

## Migration and Compatibility

### **From Existing Systems**
- **Current Discernus**: Extract framework and experiment specs from existing configs

## Conclusion

The SOAR project structure provides a comprehensive, framework-agnostic foundation for computational research. By standardizing project organization while maintaining flexibility for different analytical approaches, SOAR enables researchers to focus on their research questions rather than technical infrastructure.

**Key Benefits**:
- **Simplicity**: Clear, intuitive structure anyone can follow
- **Rigor**: Built-in validation ensures methodological quality
- **Flexibility**: Works with any analytical framework
- **Reproducibility**: Complete provenance and structured outputs
- **Scalability**: From single texts to large corpus analysis

The structure serves as the foundation for SOAR's promise: making world-class computational research as simple as pointing to a folder.
