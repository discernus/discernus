## Detailed Verification Results

### 1. **Claim Verification: "Static Weights Academically Indefensible"**

**Research Finding**: 
> "Zero analytical dimensions achieved HIGH confidence for static weights. The overwhelming context-dependency across all dimensions makes universal weighting schemes a form of false precision that undermines rather than enhances analytical rigor."

**Implementation Verification**: ✅ **VERIFIED COMPLETE**

**Evidence**:
- **CAF v4.2**: Eliminated static hierarchies (Primary 1.0, Secondary 0.8, Tertiary 0.6)
- **CFF v4.3**: Removed static formulas like `0.33 * (hope - fear) + 0.27 * (compersion - envy)`
- **All Enhanced Frameworks**: No static weight references found in current implementations
- **Explicit Documentation**: Framework v4.2 states "Previous versions...used static weight hierarchies that empirical research proved are academically indefensible"

**Calculation Transformation Verified**:
```
❌ Old (Static): dignity_score * 1.0 + truth_score * 0.8 + justice_score * 0.8
✅ New (Salience): (dignity_salience × dignity_score) + (truth_salience × truth_score) + ... / total_virtue_salience
```

### 2. **Claim Verification: "Salience-First Analysis More Robust"**

**Research Finding**:
> "The most empirically defensible approach is salience-weighted pattern detection combined with research-informed interpretive context. This transforms frameworks from 'judgment engines' into sophisticated 'measurement instruments.'"

**Implementation Verification**: ✅ **VERIFIED COMPLETE**

**Evidence**:
- **Dual-Track Analysis**: All frameworks implement both intensity scoring (0.0-1.0) and salience ranking (0.0-1.0)
- **Salience ≠ Intensity**: Explicit agent guidance distinguishing rhetorical prominence from trait strength
- **Mathematical Implementation**: Proper salience normalization process documented:
  1. Multiply each dimension score by its salience weight
  2. Sum all weighted scores  
  3. Divide by total salience weights to normalize
- **Agent Integration**: Enhanced prompts guide LLMs through salience assessment methodology

**Practical Example Verified** (CAF v4.2):
- Truth (0.6 intensity, 0.4 salience) vs Dignity (0.6 intensity, 0.9 salience)
- **Analysis**: Speaker prioritizes dignity as central to moral identity despite equal intensity scores
- **Result**: Framework correctly weights dignity higher in character assessment

### 3. **Claim Verification: "Research-Backed Interpretive Guidance"**

**Research Findings**:
- "Hope appeals more effective than fear for sustained electoral success" (MEDIUM confidence 6/10)
- "Amity-based approaches are both ethically sound and strategically effective"
- "Mature democracies exclusively" scope constraints

**Implementation Verification**: ✅ **VERIFIED COMPLETE**

**Evidence**:
- **Enhanced Linguistic Markers**: All frameworks include research-backed marker expansions
  - CAF v4.2: 147 enhanced markers for character assessment
  - Hope markers: "positive momentum," "upward trajectory," "promising opportunity"  
  - Amity markers: "trusted friend," "valued partner," "respectful dialogue"
- **Confidence Ratings**: "MEDIUM confidence (6/10)" properly documented throughout
- **Context Dependency**: Geographic and temporal scope limitations acknowledged
- **Research Provenance**: Links to underlying validation studies maintained

### 4. **Claim Verification: Academic Integrity Requirements**

**Research Requirement**: 
"Framework Transparency and Academic Integrity Requirements including confidence levels and limitation acknowledgments"

**Implementation Verification**: ✅ **VERIFIED COMPLETE**

**Evidence**:
- **Confidence Levels**: Explicit "MEDIUM confidence (6/10)" ratings throughout frameworks
- **Context Dependency Warnings**: Clear guidance about when patterns may differ
- **Research Limitations**: "Heavy concentration on Western democracies" acknowledged
- **Temporal Constraints**: "Most studies focus on short-term effects" documented
- **User-Driven Interpretation**: Frameworks provide measurement tools rather than definitive judgments

### 5. **Paradigm Transformation Verification**

**Research Paradigm Shift**:
```
From: Frameworks as definitive scoring systems claiming "good" or "effective"
To: Frameworks as measurement tools with research context for interpretation
```

**Implementation Verification**: ✅ **VERIFIED COMPLETE**

**Evidence**:
- **Framework Philosophy**: Explicit transformation documented in all enhanced frameworks
- **Measurement Focus**: Frameworks identify rhetorical patterns rather than making normative claims  
- **Research Context**: Evidence provided without universal effect claims
- **User Agency**: Analytical complexity respected with user-driven conclusions
