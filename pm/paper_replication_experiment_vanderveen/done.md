# Van der Veen Replication Experiment - COMPLETED

## ✅ Phase 1A: Foundation & Planning (COMPLETED)
- [x] Analyze original van der Veen et al. (2024) paper on automated populist language classification
- [x] Identify core methodology: LLM fine-tuning with 300 governor speeches + 45 presidential speeches
- [x] Assess paper's evaluative framework: 3 dimensions (Manichaean, People-centrism, Anti-elite)
- [x] Evaluate PDAF v10.0 as extension framework: 9 dimensions vs. original 3
- [x] Strategic alignment with Discernus GTM Phase 1.2: BYU Team Populism collaboration
- [x] Corpus scope decision: Presidential focus (exclude governors) for practical feasibility
- [x] Identify existing presidential materials in Discernus projects:
  - `/projects/2d_trump_populism/` (109 curated Trump speeches, 1988-2025)
  - `/projects/1b_chf_constitutional_health/` (45+ presidential speeches, 1993-2025)
