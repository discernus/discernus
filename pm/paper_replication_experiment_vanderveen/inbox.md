# Van der Veen Replication Experiment - INBOX
## Actionable Items (Next Priority Actions)

## üî• CRITICAL PATH ITEMS

### Corpus Unification (URGENT - Foundation for Everything)
- [ ] **Audit existing presidential materials** from both projects:
  - [ ] Catalog all Trump speeches from `/projects/2d_trump_populism/corpus/`
  - [ ] Catalog all Biden speeches from `/projects/1b_chf_constitutional_health/corpus/`
  - [ ] Identify historical presidential speeches (Clinton, Bush, Obama) for context
  - [ ] Create comprehensive inventory with metadata assessment

- [ ] **Design unified corpus structure**:
  - [ ] Define consistent metadata schema across all speeches
  - [ ] Establish election cycle categorization (2016, 2020, 2024)
  - [ ] Create speaker attribution standards
  - [ ] Plan deduplication strategy for overlapping content

- [ ] **Quality validation framework**:
  - [ ] Develop transcription accuracy assessment protocol
  - [ ] Create temporal coverage verification process
  - [ ] Establish format consistency standards
  - [ ] Plan gap-filling strategy for missing 2020/2024 speeches
