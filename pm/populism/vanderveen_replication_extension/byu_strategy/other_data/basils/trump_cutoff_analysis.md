# DISCERNUS AS PATH FORWARD: 2025 COMPUTATIONAL ADVANTAGE

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**FUTURE-FOCUSED OPPORTUNITY:** The Hawkins/Silva/Jenne 2021 paper established foundational work in mapping nationalist and populist rhetoric. Building on this legacy, Discernus represents the natural evolution - bringing computational efficiency and scale to populist discourse analysis for 2025 and beyond.

**Strategic Value:** Position Discernus as the technological path forward, demonstrating how modern AI can analyze 57 speeches in under an hour for $2.27, enabling research at unprecedented scale and speed.

## THE 2025 COMPUTATIONAL ADVANTAGE

### Efficiency Gains Demonstrated
- **Discernus PDAF Analysis:** 57 speeches processed in ~1 hour for $2.27
- **Traditional Manual Coding:** Would require weeks of human effort
- **Scale Multiplier:** 50-100x faster analysis enabling larger research scope

### Value Proposition for Team Populism
**Current Challenge:** Manual coding limits research scope and timeline
**Discernus Solution:** Computational analysis enables:
- Real-time monitoring of political rhetoric
- Cross-national comparative studies at scale
- Rapid response to emerging populist movements
- Cost-effective expansion of research capacity
