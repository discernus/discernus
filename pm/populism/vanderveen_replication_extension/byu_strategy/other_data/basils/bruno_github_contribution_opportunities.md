## STRATEGIC CONTRIBUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)
1. **Start with plot.placebos.R bug fix** - Low effort, high impact
2. **Research CRAN dependency issue** - Medium effort, high community benefit
3. **Submit clean, well-documented PRs**

### Phase 2: Follow-up (2-4 weeks)
1. **Address optimization improvements** if first PRs are successful
2. **Engage in issue discussions** to show ongoing interest
3. **Build relationship through technical discussions**

### Phase 3: Outreach Integration (4-6 weeks)
1. **Reference contributions** in your outreach email
2. **Show technical credibility** through demonstrated expertise
3. **Transition to corpus access request** once relationship is established

## SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTION STRATEGY

### For "Error in plot_placebos(placebos)":
```r
# Quick diagnostic approach:
# 1. Examine the plot.placebos.R function
# 2. Look for common R plotting errors (missing packages, data format issues)
# 3. Test with sample data to reproduce the error
# 4. Implement fix with proper error handling
```

### For "CRAN archived dependency":
```r
# Research approach:
# 1. Identify which dependency was archived
# 2. Find maintained alternatives
# 3. Update DESCRIPTION file
# 4. Test package compatibility
# 5. Update documentation
```

## TIMING AND APPROACH

### When to Contribute:
- **Now:** Start with the plot.placebos.R bug fix (quick win)
- **Week 1-2:** Submit PR and engage with Bruno on the issue
- **Week 2-4:** Work on dependency fix if first PR is well-received
- **Week 4-6:** Send outreach email referencing your contributions

### Communication Strategy:
- **Be Professional:** Introduce yourself as an independent researcher
- **Show Expertise:** Reference your computational social science background
- **Demonstrate Value:** Focus on how your fix helps the community
- **Build Relationship:** Engage thoughtfully in discussions

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

- **PR Acceptance:** At least one PR merged
- **Issue Resolution:** Successfully fix at least one open issue
- **Community Engagement:** Positive interaction in issue threads
- **Relationship Building:** Bruno responds/acknowledges your contributions

---

## BACKUP PLAN

If SCtools contributions don't gain traction:
- **Text-analysis-class:** Contribute to course materials or examples
- **bcastanho.github.io:** Suggest improvements to the academic website
- **Direct Outreach:** Proceed with the independent researcher email approach

---

## CONCLUSION

**SCtools presents an ideal opportunity for meaningful contributions that align perfectly with your expertise in computational social science.** Starting with the plot.placebos.R bug fix offers a low-risk, high-reward entry point to establish credibility with Bruno before requesting corpus access.

This approach transforms the traditional "cold outreach" into a "warm introduction" where you've already demonstrated value to the community.

**Recommended Action:** Start by cloning SCtools and reproducing the plot.placebos error. üéØ
