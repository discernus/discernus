# INDEPENDENT RESEARCHER OUTREACH: OPEN-SOURCE COLLABORATION

## STRATEGIC APPROACH: JANE GOODALL METHODOLOGY

**Positioning:** Independent researcher and open-source developer genuinely excited about computational social science, seeking authentic scholarly dialogue with Team Populism researchers.

**Objective:** Build genuine relationships through patient, observational learning and mutual discovery, leading to organic collaboration opportunities.

**Authentic Intent:** Pure open-source collaboration following Jane Goodall principles - patient observation, genuine curiosity, and relationship-building rather than technical demonstrations or dominance displays. Focus on mutual learning and advancement of computational social science.

**Methodology:** Like Jane Goodall observing chimpanzees, approach Bruno and Team Populism with respectful curiosity, learning from their expertise while sharing authentic insights from your computational journey.

- "Independent Researcher Seeking Corpus Access for Replication Study"
- "Computational Social Science: Following Up on Hawkins/Silva/Jenne (2021)"

### EMAIL BODY FOR BRUNO CASTANHO SILVA (JANE GOODALL APPROACH)

Dear Professor Castanho Silva,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I'm an independent researcher exploring the intersection of computational methods and social science research.

I've been deeply inspired by your work on nationalist and populist rhetoric frameworks, particularly your 2021 paper with Professors Hawkins and Jenne. As someone making the transition from traditional qualitative methods to computational approaches, I've found your Nationalism Populism Database work particularly illuminating for understanding how rigorous methodology can advance our field.

I'm currently developing open-source tools for political discourse analysis and would greatly value your perspective on the evolution of computational methods in political science over the past decade. Your experience bridging traditional social science with modern computational techniques seems like exactly the kind of wisdom that could help shape more effective tools for researchers.

I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on:
- How computational methods have changed research workflows in populism studies
- The challenges of maintaining methodological rigor when scaling analysis
- Future directions for open-source tools in political science

I'd be grateful for any insights you might be willing to share about your experiences and perspectives on these topics. No pressure whatsoever - I'm just genuinely curious about how someone with your expertise views the field's trajectory.

Thank you for your time and for the important work you're doing to advance computational social science.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## EMAIL VARIATION FOR KIRK HAWKINS (JANE GOODALL APPROACH)

Dear Professor Hawkins,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I'm an independent researcher exploring how computational methods can enhance social science research.

Your leadership of Team Populism and pioneering work in populist rhetoric methodologies have been truly inspirational. I've been particularly struck by how your 2021 paper with Professors Silva and Jenne managed to establish such rigorous methodological standards while also advancing the cause of open scientific collaboration in political science.

As someone coming from a traditional qualitative research background now exploring computational approaches, I'm fascinated by the evolution of research methods in our field. Your work seems to exemplify the kind of thoughtful integration of traditional social science rigor with modern computational capabilities that I'm trying to understand better.

I'm currently developing some basic open-source tools for discourse analysis and would be genuinely interested in your perspective on:
- How Team Populism has navigated the integration of computational methods into established research workflows
- The key challenges in maintaining methodological integrity when scaling analysis
- Your vision for how computational approaches might shape the future of populism research

I'd be grateful for any thoughts you might be willing to share about these topics. I'm just at the beginning of my learning journey in this area and would value the wisdom of someone with your experience in bridging these methodological worlds.

Thank you for your time and for your important contributions to advancing our understanding of populism through rigorous, innovative research.

Best regards,

## STRATEGIC RATIONALE

### Why This Jane Goodall Approach Works:
1. **Authentic Curiosity:** Genuine interest in learning from their expertise and experience
2. **Patient Observation:** Takes time to understand their world and contributions before asking
3. **Relationship First:** Builds trust and mutual respect before technical discussions
4. **No Pressure:** Creates space for natural dialogue without expectations
5. **Mutual Learning:** Both parties share insights and perspectives
6. **Sustainable Connection:** Focuses on long-term collaboration rather than quick transactions

### Success Metrics:
- **Initial Engagement:** Any thoughtful response showing interest in conversation
- **Continued Dialogue:** Multiple exchanges exploring shared interests
- **Mutual Learning:** Both parties gain insights from the conversation
- **Natural Progression:** Relationship develops organically toward collaboration
- **Authentic Partnership:** Genuine enthusiasm for working together emerges

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Stay Authentic:** Remain true to your "Cursor enabled vibe coder" identity
- **No Dominance:** Avoid any hint of trying to prove technical superiority
- **Patient Pace:** Let relationships develop naturally without rushing
- **Genuine Questions:** Ask only questions you truly want answered
- **Respect Expertise:** Show appropriate deference to their established knowledge

## FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY

### If Positive Response:
1. **Thank them immediately** for corpus access
2. **Share initial analysis insights** within 2-4 weeks
3. **Request brief methodological discussion** to build relationship
4. **Propose future collaboration** on related research

### If No Response:
1. **Wait 2-3 weeks** before gentle follow-up
2. **Try alternative contact** (other team members)
3. **Consider conference outreach** or publication comments

### If Conversation Develops:
1. **Listen and Learn:** Focus on understanding their perspectives and experiences
2. **Share Authentically:** Share your genuine journey and insights when appropriate
3. **Build Mutual Understanding:** Explore shared interests in computational social science
4. **Let Relationship Evolve:** Allow natural progression toward collaboration
5. **Offer Genuine Value:** Share resources or insights that might be helpful to them
6. **Explore Partnership:** If mutual interest develops, discuss collaborative opportunities
