## EMAIL BODY DRAFT

Dear Professor Castanho Silva,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I'm reaching out from Discernus, a computational research platform designed to advance social science methodologies through modern AI.

Your work with Professor Hawkins and Professor Jenne on "Mapping Nationalist and Populist Rhetoric across Europe and North America" (2021) has been foundational in establishing rigorous methodologies for studying populist discourse. As someone who maintains an active GitHub presence and leads the Textual Analysis team at Team Populism, I believe you'd be interested in how computational approaches have evolved since your groundbreaking publication.

We're excited to share that we've recently processed 57 presidential speeches using a Populist Discourse Analysis Framework - in under an hour, for $2.27. This demonstrates the efficiency gains possible with modern AI while maintaining the methodological rigor that your team has championed.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how computational methods could enhance Team Populism's research capacity? We're particularly interested in exploring compatibility with your established frameworks and discussing opportunities for collaborative advancement.

I'm happy to provide a technical demonstration or share our recent analysis results if that would be helpful.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]
