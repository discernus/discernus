## ENHANCED OUTREACH CAMPAIGN

### Email 1: Bruno Castanho Silva (Primary Basil)
**Subject:** Enhancing Your Nationalist and Populist Rhetoric Mapping with LLM Methods

**Personalized Opening:**
```
Dear Professor Castanho Silva,

I was particularly impressed by your 2021 Studies in Comparative International Development paper "Mapping Nationalist and Populist Rhetoric across Europe and North America" with Kirk Hawkins and Erin Jenne.

Your computational approach to rhetoric mapping across Europe and North America is foundational work in the field. As someone with the technical sophistication to maintain a GitHub.io site and machine learning expertise, you understand the challenges and opportunities in this methodological space.
```

### Email 2: Kirk Hawkins (Ultimate Decision-Maker)
**Subject:** Advancing Computational Populism Research - Building on Your 2021 Rhetoric Mapping

**Personalized Opening:**
```
Dear Professor Hawkins,

Your 2021 paper "Mapping Nationalist and Populist Rhetoric across Europe and North America" with Bruno Castanho Silva and Erin Jenne represents a cornerstone in computational populism research.

As the director of Team Populism, your leadership in developing computational methods for rhetoric analysis is inspiring. We're exploring how LLM-based approaches could enhance the rhetoric mapping methodologies established in your influential work.
```

### Follow-up Strategy
**Day 3:** Gentle follow-up if no response
**Day 7:** Value proposition reinforcement
**Day 10:** Technical discussion scheduling push

## CONTINGENCY PLANS

### Scenario 1: Data Access Issues
**Action:** Use publicly available similar rhetoric datasets for demonstration
**Backup:** Focus on methodological enhancement rather than exact replication
**Escalation:** Request collaboration on new rhetoric mapping projects

### Scenario 2: One Target Unresponsive
**Action:** Strengthen engagement with responsive target
**Backup:** Use successful engagement to create introduction to second target
**Escalation:** Leverage Team Populism network connections

### Scenario 3: Timeline Delays
**Action:** Phase outreach with technical development
**Backup:** Send preliminary findings to maintain momentum
**Escalation:** Propose staged collaboration approach

### Scenario 4: Technical Complexity
**Action:** Focus on high-impact enhancement demonstrations
**Backup:** Prepare simplified explanations for non-technical discussion
**Escalation:** Offer extensive technical documentation and support
