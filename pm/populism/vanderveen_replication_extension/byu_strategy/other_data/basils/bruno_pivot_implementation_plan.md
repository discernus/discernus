- **Conservative Claims:** Focus on enhancement, not replacement
- **Fallback Position:** Keep Van der Veen as backup option
- **Transparent Communication:** Be open about pivot rationale

### Contingency Plans
- **Data Access Block:** Use publicly available similar datasets for demonstration
- **Timeline Slip:** Phase outreach with technical development
- **Bruno Unavailable:** Apply same approach to other Team Populism researchers

## CONCLUSION

### Strategic Imperative
**EXECUTE THIS PIVOT IMMEDIATELY.** The potential 3x improvement in engagement success justifies the additional investment.

### Why This Will Succeed
1. **Personal Investment:** Bruno deeply invested in his own work enhancement
2. **Technical Credibility:** Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of his methods
3. **Citation Impact:** Improving a 391-citation paper creates maximum academic value
4. **Network Effects:** Success ripples through his extensive Team Populism network

### Immediate Action Required
**Start data acquisition and outreach updates TODAY.** Every day of delay reduces the personal relevance advantage.

**Expected Outcome:** Transform generic demonstration into deeply personal collaboration that establishes Discernus as Bruno's preferred methodological enhancement partner.
