# Historical v3.2 Framework Archive

## Context

These frameworks represent an **abandoned coordinate system approach** from earlier platform iterations. While the v3.2 coordinate system was deemed "more trouble than it was worth," these frameworks contain valuable theoretical content that could be migrated to current Framework Specification v3.1 format.

## Historical Significance

### What Worked
- **Domain diversity**: Business ethics, moral foundations, civic virtue
- **Theoretical sophistication**: Rich academic grounding
- **Framework agnosticism**: Proof of platform's intended breadth

### What Didn't Work
- **Coordinate system complexity**: Arc positioning, competitive dynamics modeling
- **Over-engineering**: Too many mathematical abstractions
- **Implementation burden**: Complex specifications hard to operationalize

## Migration Potential

These frameworks could be **converted to current v3.1 specification** by:
1. **Stripping coordinate system elements** (arc positioning, competitive dynamics)
2. **Extracting core theoretical content** (anchors, linguistic markers, scoring)
3. **Reformatting to v3.1 YAML structure** (matching CFF v3.1 and PDAF patterns)
4. **Validating with current ThinOrchestrator** architecture

## Strategic Value

For the **archaeological recovery mission**, these frameworks:
- **Prove platform's theoretical ambition** beyond political analysis
- **Provide migration source material** for domain expansion
- **Validate framework agnosticism** requirements
- **Document lessons learned** about over-engineering

## Recommendation

Use as **reference material** for future framework development, not as direct operational targets. The theoretical content is valuable; the coordinate system architecture should remain deprecated.
