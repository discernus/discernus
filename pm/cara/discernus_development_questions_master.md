# Discernus Development Questions Master Document
## Strategic Question Framework for Research-Grade System Evolution

**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Status**: ACTIVE PLANNING  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive question framework to guide development from MVP to research-grade system

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Executive Summary**

The MVP has **proven the THICK LLM + THIN Software philosophy** through successful Lincoln vs Trump analysis. Now we must evolve to research-grade capabilities while maintaining our core architecture. This document organizes all critical development questions into actionable epics with clear priorities and dependencies.

**Key Strategic Insight**: The **autonomous research agent (knowledgenaut)** concept could be transformative - research agents that discover, evaluate, and synthesize literature autonomously rather than consuming pre-curated knowledge.

## ðŸ“Š **Question Classification Framework**

### **Epic Categories**
- **FOUNDATION**: Must solve first - everything depends on this
- **CORE**: Central capabilities that define "research-grade"  
- **INFRASTRUCTURE**: Enabling capabilities that support core functions
- **ADOPTION**: Critical for real-world usage and collaboration

### **Priority Levels**
- **P0**: Blocking - must solve to proceed
- **P1**: High - core research-grade capabilities
- **P2**: Medium - important but not blocking
- **P3**: Low - nice to have, future considerations
