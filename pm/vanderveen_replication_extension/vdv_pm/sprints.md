  - [ ] Define expansion strategy, timeline, quality standards, metadata requirements, processing workflows
  - [ ] **DoD**: Comprehensive plan document completed with actionable steps

- [ ] **Existing Corpora Survey**
  - [ ] Survey `/projects/` and `/corpus/` for presidential speech materials by election cycle, speaker, format
  - [ ] Assess quality and compatibility with Phase 2 requirements
  - [ ] **DoD**: Complete inventory with quality assessment and compatibility matrix

- [ ] **Tool Integration & Strategy**
  - [ ] Examine `/corpus/tools/` for corpus processing capabilities
  - [ ] Identify relevant strategies from `/corpus/` for enrichment
  - [ ] Integrate tools into Phase 2 workflow, develop enhanced processing strategies
  - [ ] **DoD**: Tool integration plan completed, workflow documented

- [ ] **Corpus Expansion Execution**
  - [ ] Extract additional Trump speeches (2020, 2024 campaigns)
  - [ ] Collect Biden presidential speeches (2020-2024)
  - [ ] Process historical Obama speeches (2008, 2012)
  - [ ] **DoD**: All target materials identified and processing initiated

- [ ] **Phase 2 Completion & Review**
  - [ ] Finalize expanded corpus (target: 200+ speeches)
  - [ ] Document corpus expansion methodology
  - [ ] Prepare Phase 3 transition plan
  - [ ] Generate Phase 2 completion report
  - [ ] **DoD**: Expanded corpus ready, methodology documented, Phase 3 plan prepared
