    "raw_content": "Name of politician:  Hillary Clinton\nTitle of Speech:  Hillary Clinton’s Campaign Launch Speech\nDate of Speech: June 13, 2015\nCategory: Campaign\nGrader:  Rebecca Dudley\nDate of grading:  April 25, 2016\nFinal Grade (delete unused grades): 0.6\n1A speech in this category includes strong, clearly populist elements but either does not use them consistently or tempers them by including non-populist elements. Thus, the discourse may have a romanticized notion of the people and the idea of a unified popular will (indeed, it must in order to be considered populist), but it avoids bellicose language or references to cosmic proportions or any particular enemy.\nScore here (0, 1,2)\nPopulist\nPluralist\nManichaean vision\n1\n0.7\nIt conveys a Manichaean vision of the world, that is, one that is moral (every issue has a strong moral dimension) and dualistic (everything is in one category or the other, “right” or “wrong,” “good” or “evil”) The implication—or even the stated idea—is that there can be nothing in between, no fence-sitting, no shades of grey. This leads to the use of highly charged, even bellicose language.\n“I believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny. Each American and the country we cherish.”\nThe discourse does not frame issues in moral terms or paint them in black-and-white. Instead, there is a strong tendency to focus on narrow, particular issues. The discourse will emphasize or at least not eliminate the possibility of natural, justifiable differences of opinion.\nThe moral significance of the items mentioned in the speech is heightened by ascribing cosmic proportions to them, that is, by claiming that they affect people everywhere (possibly but not necessarily across the world) and across time. Especially in this last regard, frequent references may be made to a reified notion of “history.” At the same time, the speaker will justify the moral significance of his or her ideas by tying them to national and religious leaders that are generally revered.\n“As we have since our founding, Americans made a new beginning.”\nThe discourse will probably not refer to any reified notion of history or use any cosmic proportions. References to the spatial and temporal consequences of issues will be limited to the material reality rather than any mystical connections.\nPopulist notion of the people\n1\n0.8\nAlthough Manichaean, the discourse is still democratic, in the sense that the good is embodied in the will of the majority, which is seen as a unified whole, perhaps but not necessarily expressed in references to the “voluntad del pueblo”; however, the speaker ascribes a kind of unchanging essentialism to that will, rather than letting it be whatever 50 percent of the people want at any particular moment. Thus, this good majority is romanticized, with some notion of the common man (urban or rural) seen as the embodiment of the national ideal.\n“You worked extra shifts, took second jobs, postponed home repairs….you figured out how to make it work.”\n“I’m running to make our economy work for you and for every American….For the veterans who served our country. For the small business owners who took a risk. For everyone who’s ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out. I’m not running for some Americans, I’m running for all Americans.”\nDemocracy is simply the calculation of votes. This should be respected and is seen as the foundation of legitimate government, but it is not meant to be an exercise in arriving at a preexisting, knowable “will.” The majority shifts and changes across issues. The common man is not romanticized, and the notion of citizenship is broad and legalistic.\nEvil elite\n0\n0.3\nThe evil is embodied in a minority—more specifically, an elite—whose specific identity will vary according to context. Domestically, in Latin America it is often an economic elite, perhaps the “oligarchy,” but it may also be a racial elite; internationally, it may be the United States or the capitalist, industrialized nations or international financiers or simply an ideology such as neoliberalism and capitalism.\n“Prosperity can’t be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers. Democracy can’t be just for billionaires and corporations.”\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\n“the Republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars, and family incomes dropped. You know where we ended up.”\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues. In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\n“These Republicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.”\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor. The discourse will not encourage or justify illegal, violent actions. There will be great respect for institutions and the rule of law. If data is abused, it is either an innocent mistake or an embarrassing breach of democratic standards.\nOverall comments: Secretary Clinton’s speech used some populist elements inconsistently, but within a larger pluralist framework. She talks about the American dream and attempts frequently to tie in the idea of the everyday or average American. However, her mentions of an evil elite are too dry to be considered malicious and vitriolic. Also, she talks more specifically about particular issues. She paints herself as a progressive for the American people, but there isn’t enough consistency or denigration of an elite for it to be considered truly populist.",

Por sobre una visión maniquea, en el discurso predomina una visión pluralista del mundo. Finalmente, no se identifica una noción de voluntad general del pueblo como fuente de legitimidad política. Además, por sobre un cambio radical, el discurso está centrado en políticas específicas para el ámbito militar. Por estas razones el discurso puede ser calificado con una nota de 0,1.",

Note that even if a speech expresses a Manichaean worldview, it is not considered populist if it lacks some notion of a popular will.\nScore here (0, 1,2)\nPopulist\nPluralist\nManichaean vision\n0,3\nIt conveys a Manichaean vision of the world, that is, one that is moral (every issue has a strong moral dimension) and dualistic (everything is in one category or the other, “right” or “wrong,” “good” or “evil”) The implication—or even the stated idea—is that there can be nothing in between, no fence-sitting, no shades of grey. This leads to the use of highly charged, even bellicose language.\n“And that is why I believe Donald Trump is so dangerous.”\n“It’s there in how he wants to ban Muslims from coming to the United States, and toyed with creating a database to track Muslims in America. It’s there in the way he demeans women, in his promotion of an anti-Semitic image pushed by neo-Nazis, and in the months that he spent trying to discredit the citizenship and legitimacy of our first black President.”\n“This man is the nominee of the Party of Lincoln. We are watching it become the Party of Trump. And that’s not just a huge loss for our democracy – it is a threat to it.”\nThe discourse does not frame issues in moral terms or paint them in black-and-white. Instead, there is a strong tendency to focus on narrow, particular issues. The discourse will emphasize or at least not eliminate the possibility of natural, justifiable differences of opinion.\n“Everyone in America, everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. Surely that is something we can all unite behind.”\n“We may disagree on the causes and the solutions to the challenges we face – but I believe like anyone else, they’re trying to figure out their place in a fast-changing America. They want to know how to make a good living and how to give their kids better futures and opportunities. That’s why we’ve got to reclaim the promise of America for all our people – no matter who they vote for.”\n“And let’s be more than allies to each other. Let’s take on each other’s struggles as our own.”\nThe moral significance of the items mentioned in the speech is heightened by ascribing cosmic proportions to them, that is, by claiming that they affect people everywhere (possibly but not necessarily across the world) and across time. Especially in this last regard, frequent references may be made to a reified notion of “history.” At the same time, the speaker will justify the moral significance of his or her ideas by tying them to national and religious leaders that are generally revered.\nThe discourse will probably not refer to any reified notion of history or use any cosmic proportions. References to the spatial and temporal consequences of issues will be limited to the material reality rather than any mystical connections.\nPopulist notion of the people\n0\nAlthough Manichaean, the discourse is still democratic, in the sense that the good is embodied in the will of the majority, which is seen as a unified whole, perhaps but not necessarily expressed in references to the “voluntad del pueblo”; however, the speaker ascribes a kind of unchanging essentialism to that will, rather than letting it be whatever 50 percent of the people want at any particular moment. Thus, this good majority is romanticized, with some notion of the common man (urban or rural) seen as the embodiment of the national ideal.\nDemocracy is simply the calculation of votes. This should be respected and is seen as the foundation of legitimate government, but it is not meant to be an exercise in arriving at a preexisting, knowable “will.” The majority shifts and changes across issues. The common man is not romanticized, and the notion of citizenship is broad and legalistic.\n“We share this miraculous country. This land and its heritage is yours, mine and everyone’s – willing to pledge allegiance and understand the solemn responsibilities of American citizenship. That’s what ‘indivisible’ means – that big word that every grade school student knows – that we’re in this together, even if that’s not always easy.”\nEvil elite\n0\nThe evil is embodied in a minority—more specifically, an elite—whose specific identity will vary according to context. Domestically, in Latin America it is often an economic elite, perhaps the “oligarchy,” but it may also be a racial elite; internationally, it may be the United States or the capitalist, industrialized nations or international financiers or simply an ideology such as neoliberalism and capitalism.\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues. In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\n“We do need criminal justice reform to save lives and to make sure all Americans are treated as equals in rights and dignity.”\n“That’s why I’ve pledged that in my first 100 days as President, we will make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor. The discourse will not encourage or justify illegal, violent actions. There will be great respect for institutions and the rule of law. If data is abused, it is either an innocent mistake or an embarrassing breach of democratic standards.\nOverall Comments (just a few sentences):\nEl discurso no presenta los elementos necesarios para ser considera como populista. En primer lugar, no se reconoce una apelación al pueblo americano. Segundo, tampoco se reconoce una elite clara que atente contra los intereses del pueblo. Por sobre la construcción de un pueblo en oposición a una elite, el discurso está centrado en el pluralismo y la indivisibilidad del pueblo americano. Sin embargo, el discurso presenta un carácter maniqueo al referirse a la figura de Donald Trump, reconociéndolo como alguien peligroso y una amenaza para la democracia de EEUU. Finalmente, no se identifica una noción de voluntad general del pueblo como fuente de legitimidad política que cambie la situación actual, sino que se reconocen ciertas políticas específicas orientadas a generar empleo y reformar la justicia. Por estas razones el discurso puede ser calificado con una nota de 0,1.",

In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.”\n“And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate. They don't give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.”\n“But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.”\nThe discourse does not frame issues in moral terms or paint them in black-and-white. Instead, there is a strong tendency to focus on narrow, particular issues. The discourse will emphasize or at least not eliminate the possibility of natural, justifiable differences of opinion.\n“First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.”\n“You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.”\n“But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.”\nThe moral significance of the items mentioned in the speech is heightened by ascribing cosmic proportions to them, that is, by claiming that they affect people everywhere (possibly but not necessarily across the world) and across time. Especially in this last regard, frequent references may be made to a reified notion of “history.” At the same time, the speaker will justify the moral significance of his or her ideas by tying them to national and religious leaders that are generally revered.\nThe discourse will probably not refer to any reified notion of history or use any cosmic proportions. References to the spatial and temporal consequences of issues will be limited to the material reality rather than any mystical connections.\nPopulist notion of the people\n0\nAlthough Manichaean, the discourse is still democratic, in the sense that the good is embodied in the will of the majority, which is seen as a unified whole, perhaps but not necessarily expressed in references to the “voluntad del pueblo”; however, the speaker ascribes a kind of unchanging essentialism to that will, rather than letting it be whatever 50 percent of the people want at any particular moment. Thus, this good majority is romanticized, with some notion of the common man (urban or rural) seen as the embodiment of the national ideal.\nDemocracy is simply the calculation of votes. This should be respected and is seen as the foundation of legitimate government, but it is not meant to be an exercise in arriving at a preexisting, knowable “will.” The majority shifts and changes across issues. The common man is not romanticized, and the notion of citizenship is broad and legalistic.\nEvil elite\n1,0\nThe evil is embodied in a minority—more specifically, an elite—whose specific identity will vary according to context. Domestically, in Latin America it is often an economic elite, perhaps the “oligarchy,” but it may also be a racial elite; internationally, it may be the United States or the capitalist, industrialized nations or international financiers or simply an ideology such as neoliberalism and capitalism.\n“You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.”\n“What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.”\n“I don't think top-down works in America.”\n“But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.”\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues. In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\n“That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.”\n“We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.”\n“I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.”\n“I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.”\n“So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.”\n“And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor. The discourse will not encourage or justify illegal, violent actions. There will be great respect for institutions and the rule of law. If data is abused, it is either an innocent mistake or an embarrassing breach of democratic standards.\nOverall Comments (just a few sentences):\nEl discurso no presenta los elementos necesarios para ser considerado como populista. En primer lugar, se reconoce una apelación al pueblo americano, sin embargo, esta no es central en el discurso, n tampoco se construye en oposición a una elite. Segundo, se reconoce la identificación de una elite minoritaria representada por las grandes corporaciones y la imagen de Donald Trump. Por sobre una visión maniquea, en el discurso predomina una visión pluralista del mundo y el carácter maniqueo aparece siempre relacionado a la imagen de Trump. Finalmente, no se identifica una noción de voluntad general del pueblo como fuente de legitimidad política. Además, por sobre un cambio radical, el discurso está centrado en políticas específicas como la generación de empleo, la inversión en las clases medias, reforma educacional, reforma a la justicia, entre otras. Por estas razones el discurso puede ser calificado con una nota de 0,2.",

This leads to the use of highly charged, even bellicose language.\n“We have sent a message that will echo from Wall Street to Washington, from Maine to California, and that is that the government of our great country belongs to all of the people and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors, and their Super PACs.”\n“And, when the top one-tenth of 1% now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%, that's not fair. It is not fair when the 20 wealthiest people in this country now own more wealth than the bottom half of the American people.”\nThe discourse does not frame issues in moral terms or paint them in black-and-white.

That is an obscenity, and let me tell you something. When we make it to the White House, the pharmaceutical industry will not continue to rip-off the American people.”\n“We will all come together to say loudly, and clearly that the government of our great nation belongs to all of us, not just a few wealthy campaign contributors. That is what this campaign is about, that is what the political revolution is about.”\nDemocracy is simply the calculation of votes.

Domestically, in Latin America it is often an economic elite, perhaps the “oligarchy,” but it may also be a racial elite; internationally, it may be the United States or the capitalist, industrialized nations or international financiers or simply an ideology such as neoliberalism and capitalism.\n“Tonight, we served notice to the political and economic establishment of this country that the American people will not continue to accept a corrupt campaign finance system that is undermining American democracy, and we will not accept a rigged economy in which ordinary Americans work longer hours for lower wages, while almost all new income and wealth goes to the top 1%.”\n“No, we will not allow huge tax breaks for billionaires, we will not allow packed -- huge cuts to social security, veterans needs, Medicare, MedicAid, and education. No, we will not allow back into the White House a political party which is so beholden to the fossil fuel industry that they cannot even acknowledge the scientific reality of climate change”\n“My friends, we must tell the billionaire class and the 1% that they cannot have it all at a time of massive wealth and income inequality, the wealthiest people and largest corporations in this country will start their paying their fair share of taxes.”\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\n“So, are you guys ready for a radical idea? Together we are going to create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1%. And, when millions of our people are working for starvation wages, yep, we're going to raise the minimum wage to $15 bucks an hour. And, we are going to bring pay equity for women. And, when we need the best educated workforce in the world, yes, we are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free. And, for the millions of Americans struggling with horrendous levels of student debt, we are going to substantially ease that burden.”\n“It is a political revolution that will bring tens of millions of our people together. It will bring together working people who have given up on the political process. It will bring together young people who have never participated in the political process. It will bring together blacks, and whites, latinos, Asian-Americans, Native Americans, straight and gay, male and female. People who were born in America, and people who immigrated here.”\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues.

En primer lugar, se reconoce una apelación al pueblo entendido de manera inclusiva, considerando a los sectores excluidos de la sociedad norteamericana. Segundo, se identifica a una elite minoritaria que atenta contra los intereses del pueblo, representada por los de arriba, el establishment político, económico y mediático, el 1% y la clase billonaria. A partir de la identificación de ambos grupos, se reconoce una visión maniquea del mundo donde la elite es corrupta y engaña al pueblo (negando el cambio climático), mientras que el pueblo una entidad virtuosa. Finalmente, es posible identificar la noción de la voluntad general del pueblo y soberanía popular como fuente de legitimidad política, la cual puede imponerse y cambiar la situación de crisis que vive EEUU. Además, el candidato propone la necesidad de generar una revolución política que cambie de manera radical a la sociedad norteamericana.\nNo obstante de estos tres elementos, la falta de un lenguaje demasiado belicoso y la defensa de la democracia permite calificar el discurso con una nota de 1,6.",

Note that even if a speech expresses a Manichaean worldview, it is not considered populist if it lacks some notion of a popular will.\nScore here (0, 1,2)\nPopulist\nPluralist\nManichaean vision\n0\nIt conveys a Manichaean vision of the world, that is, one that is moral (every issue has a strong moral dimension) and dualistic (everything is in one category or the other, “right” or “wrong,” “good” or “evil”) The implication—or even the stated idea—is that there can be nothing in between, no fence-sitting, no shades of grey. This leads to the use of highly charged, even bellicose language.\nThe discourse does not frame issues in moral terms or paint them in black-and-white. Instead, there is a strong tendency to focus on narrow, particular issues. The discourse will emphasize or at least not eliminate the possibility of natural, justifiable differences of opinion.\n“We’ve had a few glitches with others who don’t seem to understand what the ingredients are for building an economy that works for everybody, not just those at the top…”\n“That’s why I want to expand incentives like the new market’s tax credit, empowerment zones and other ideas that bring business, government and communities together to create good jobs in poor or remote areas.”\n“Those barriers, they hold back African-Americans, Latinos, Asian and Native Americans and women from fully participating in our economy. We need to reverse the long-term neglect that has dried up jobs and opportunity in communities of color, in poor communities.”\nThe moral significance of the items mentioned in the speech is heightened by ascribing cosmic proportions to them, that is, by claiming that they affect people everywhere (possibly but not necessarily across the world) and across time. Especially in this last regard, frequent references may be made to a reified notion of “history.” At the same time, the speaker will justify the moral significance of his or her ideas by tying them to national and religious leaders that are generally revered.\nThe discourse will probably not refer to any reified notion of history or use any cosmic proportions. References to the spatial and temporal consequences of issues will be limited to the material reality rather than any mystical connections.\nPopulist notion of the people\n0\nAlthough Manichaean, the discourse is still democratic, in the sense that the good is embodied in the will of the majority, which is seen as a unified whole, perhaps but not necessarily expressed in references to the “voluntad del pueblo”; however, the speaker ascribes a kind of unchanging essentialism to that will, rather than letting it be whatever 50 percent of the people want at any particular moment. Thus, this good majority is romanticized, with some notion of the common man (urban or rural) seen as the embodiment of the national ideal.\nDemocracy is simply the calculation of votes. This should be respected and is seen as the foundation of legitimate government, but it is not meant to be an exercise in arriving at a preexisting, knowable “will.” The majority shifts and changes across issues. The common man is not romanticized, and the notion of citizenship is broad and legalistic.\nEvil elite\n1\nThe evil is embodied in a minority—more specifically, an elite—whose specific identity will vary according to context. Domestically, in Latin America it is often an economic elite, perhaps the “oligarchy,” but it may also be a racial elite; internationally, it may be the United States or the capitalist, industrialized nations or international financiers or simply an ideology such as neoliberalism and capitalism.\n“As I said yesterday in Ohio, Donald Trump offers no real solutions for the economic challenges we face. He just continues to spout reckless ideas that will run up our debt and cause another economic crash.”\n“And yes, we know, too many special interests with too many lobbyists have stood in the way of progress while protecting the perks of the privileged few.”\n“The bottom line is that too many leaders in business and government have lost sight of our shared responsibility to each other and to our nation.”\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues. In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\n“A historic investment in jobs, debt-free college, profit sharing, making those at the top pay their fair share, putting families first in a modern economy and a democracy where working people’s voices are actually heard. That is what we are fighting for in this election.”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor. The discourse will not encourage or justify illegal, violent actions. There will be great respect for institutions and the rule of law. If data is abused, it is either an innocent mistake or an embarrassing breach of democratic standards.\nOverall Comments (just a few sentences):\nEl discurso no presenta los elementos necesarios para ser considera como populista. En primer lugar, se reconoce una apelación al pueblo americano, pero este no es central en el discurso y no está definido en oposición a la elite. Segundo, se reconoce una elite representada por los de arriba, los intereses especiales y el gobierno, quienes se han olvidado de beneficiar al resto de los americanos. No obstante, se reconoce un discurso pluralista ya que la centralidad está en que se beneficien todos los americanos (incluyendo a las minorías) y no solo los de arriba. El discurso se vuelve más maniqueo cuando Clinton se refiere a Trump, reconociendo que es incapaz de gobernar al EEUU. Finalmente, no se identifica una noción de voluntad general del pueblo como fuente de legitimidad política que cambie la situación actual, sino que se reconocen ciertas políticas específicas orientadas a generar empleo aumentar impuestos a los ricos y centrarse en las familias. Por estas razones el discurso puede ser calificado con una nota de 0,3.",

References to the spatial and temporal consequences of issues will be limited to the material reality rather than any mystical connections.\nPopulist notion of the people\n0\nAlthough Manichaean, the discourse is still democratic, in the sense that the good is embodied in the will of the majority, which is seen as a unified whole, perhaps but not necessarily expressed in references to the “voluntad del pueblo”; however, the speaker ascribes a kind of unchanging essentialism to that will, rather than letting it be whatever 50 percent of the people want at any particular moment. Thus, this good majority is romanticized, with some notion of the common man (urban or rural) seen as the embodiment of the national ideal.\nDemocracy is simply the calculation of votes. This should be respected and is seen as the foundation of legitimate government, but it is not meant to be an exercise in arriving at a preexisting, knowable “will.” The majority shifts and changes across issues. The common man is not romanticized, and the notion of citizenship is broad and legalistic.\nEvil elite\n0\nThe evil is embodied in a minority—more specifically, an elite—whose specific identity will vary according to context. Domestically, in Latin America it is often an economic elite, perhaps the “oligarchy,” but it may also be a racial elite; internationally, it may be the United States or the capitalist, industrialized nations or international financiers or simply an ideology such as neoliberalism and capitalism.\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues. In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor. The discourse will not encourage or justify illegal, violent actions. There will be great respect for institutions and the rule of law. If data is abused, it is either an innocent mistake or an embarrassing breach of democratic standards.\nOverall Comments (just a few sentences):\nEl discurso no presenta los elementos necesarios para ser considerado como populista. En primer lugar, no se reconoce una apelación al pueblo como una entidad virtuosa. Segundo, no se reconoce la identificación de una elite minoritaria que atente contra los intereses del pueblo. En el discurso predomina una visión pluralista del mundo. No obstante, se observa un fuerte carácter maniqueo principalmente asociado a la imagen de Trump como un racista, misogeno e incluso un pedófilo. De esta manera, el discurso está marcado por moverse en el registro moral, donde por un lado esta Trump y en el otro el resto de los americanos. Finalmente, no se identifica una noción de voluntad general del pueblo como fuente de legitimidad política. El discurso no profundiza en las propuestas de la candidata. Por estas razones el discurso puede ser calificado con una nota de 0,1.",

The common man is not romanticized, and the notion of citizenship is broad and legalistic.\nEvil elite\n1\nThe evil is embodied in a minority—more specifically, an elite—whose specific identity will vary according to context. Domestically, in Latin America it is often an economic elite, perhaps the “oligarchy,” but it may also be a racial elite; internationally, it may be the United States or the capitalist, industrialized nations or international financiers or simply an ideology such as neoliberalism and capitalism.\n“But there are common-sense things that your government could do that would give Americans more opportunities to succeed. Why don’t we do it? Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress.”\n“And Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich, should finally pay their fair share of taxes. That’s why I support the so-called ‘Buffett Rule,’ because multi-millionaires should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries.”\n“And then there is Trump’s tax plan. He would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, and Wall Street money managers. That would explode our national debt and eventually lead to massive cuts in priorities like education, healthcare, and environmental protection.”\n“His plan was panned from the left, the right, the center – because it transparently is designed for rich people like him.”\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues. In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\n“And, it’s crucial that every American have access to the education and skills they need to get the jobs of the future.\nSo we will fight to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for everyone.”\n“We will put Americans to work building and modernizing our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our railways, our ports, our airports.”\n“let’s connect every household in America to broadband by the year 2020.”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor. The discourse will not encourage or justify illegal, violent actions. There will be great respect for institutions and the rule of law. If data is abused, it is either an innocent mistake or an embarrassing breach of democratic standards.\nOverall Comments (just a few sentences):\nEl discurso no presenta los elementos necesarios para ser considerado como populista. En primer lugar, se reconoce una apelación al pueblo americano, no obstante, éste no es central en el discurso. Segundo, se reconoce la identificación de una elite representada por las grandes corporaciones, Wall Street, los millonarios y principalmente la figura de Trump como miembro de este grupo minoritario. A pesar de que el discurso muestra algunas dicotomías y a veces una visión maniquea, predomina una visión pluralista del mundo ya que se buscan construir acuerdos con todos los americanos. Finalmente, no se identifica una noción de voluntad general del pueblo como fuente de legitimidad política que permita modificar el status quo. Más bien existe una idea de que todos los americanos se unan e impidan que Trump sea presidente. Además, el discurso está centrado en políticas específicas como la creación de empleo, educación gratuita y la mejora de infraestructura. Por estas razones el discurso puede ser calificado con una nota de 0,4.",

The discourse will emphasize or at least not eliminate the possibility of natural, justifiable differences of opinion.\n“And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people. Not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.”\n“I want to get everybody out of the shadows.

And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.”\n“That’s why I want more technical education and community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young peel for the jobs of the future.

In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\n“In the process, we will make government leaner and more responsive to the public.”\n“Early in my term, I will also be requesting that all NATO nations promptly pay their bills, which many are not doing right now.”\n“We will build an active Army of around 540,000, as the Army’s chief of staff has said he needs.”\n“We will build a Marine Corps based on 36 battalions, which the Heritage Foundation notes is the minimum needed to deal with major contingencies – we have 23 now.”\n“We will build a Navy of 350 surface ships and submarines, as recommended by the bipartisan National Defense Panel – we have 276 ships now.”\n“And we will build an Air Force of at least 1,200 fighter aircraft, which the Heritage Foundation has shown to be needed to execute current missions – we have 1,113 now.”\n“We will also seek to develop a state of the art missile defense system.”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor. The discourse will not encourage or justify illegal, violent actions. There will be great respect for institutions and the rule of law. If data is abused, it is either an innocent mistake or an embarrassing breach of democratic standards.\nOverall Comments (just a few sentences):\nEl discurso no presenta los elementos necesarios para ser considerado como populista. En primer lugar, no se reconoce de manera clara la apelación al pueblo americano. Segundo, se reconoce de manera poco clara la identificación de una elite representada por la figura de Hillary Clinton y Barack Obama, como quienes han tomado malas decisiones y han desmantelado a los militares. De esta manera, el discurso construye dicotomías entre la forma vieja y nueva de hacer las cosas. En tercer lugar, no se reconoce cierta una noción de voluntad general como fuente de legitimidad política. Más bien aparece de forma fuerte la idea de soberanía nacional. Finalmente, el discurso se enfoca en ciertas políticas específicas de seguridad como potenciar a los militares y renegociar los acuerdos internacionales. A partir de los elementos anteriores es posible clasificar el discurso con una nota de 0,4.",

    "raw_content": "Name of politician:  Donald Trump\nTitle of Speech:  NYC Speech on Stakes on the Election\nDate of Speech: June 22, 2016\nCategory: Electoral Speech\nGrader:  Cristóbal Sandoval\nDate of grading:  July 27, 2016\nFinal Grade (delete unused grades):\n1A speech in this category includes strong, clearly populist elements but either does not use them consistently or tempers them by including non-populist elements. Thus, the discourse may have a romanticized notion of the people and the idea of a unified popular will (indeed, it must in order to be considered populist), but it avoids bellicose language or references to cosmic proportions or any particular enemy.\nScore here (0, 1,2)\nPopulist\nPluralist\nManichaean vision\n1,5\nIt conveys a Manichaean vision of the world, that is, one that is moral (every issue has a strong moral dimension) and dualistic (everything is in one category or the other, “right” or “wrong,” “good” or “evil”) The implication—or even the stated idea—is that there can be nothing in between, no fence-sitting, no shades of grey. This leads to the use of highly charged, even bellicose language.\n“Because it’s not just the political system that’s rigged. It’s the whole economy.\nIt’s rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.\nIt’s rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.\nIt’s rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.\nIt’s rigged against you, the American people.”\n“I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.\nWe are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.\nThis election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.”\n“The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.”\n“Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.”\n“No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.\nHer decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.”\nThe discourse does not frame issues in moral terms or paint them in black-and-white. Instead, there is a strong tendency to focus on narrow, particular issues. The discourse will emphasize or at least not eliminate the possibility of natural, justifiable differences of opinion.\nThe moral significance of the items mentioned in the speech is heightened by ascribing cosmic proportions to them, that is, by claiming that they affect people everywhere (possibly but not necessarily across the world) and across time. Especially in this last regard, frequent references may be made to a reified notion of “history.” At the same time, the speaker will justify the moral significance of his or her ideas by tying them to national and religious leaders that are generally revered.\n“Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that built the great dams, and so much more.”\nThe discourse will probably not refer to any reified notion of history or use any cosmic proportions. References to the spatial and temporal consequences of issues will be limited to the material reality rather than any mystical connections.\nPopulist notion of the people\n0,8\nAlthough Manichaean, the discourse is still democratic, in the sense that the good is embodied in the will of the majority, which is seen as a unified whole, perhaps but not necessarily expressed in references to the “voluntad del pueblo”; however, the speaker ascribes a kind of unchanging essentialism to that will, rather than letting it be whatever 50 percent of the people want at any particular moment. Thus, this good majority is romanticized, with some notion of the common man (urban or rural) seen as the embodiment of the national ideal.\n“We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.”\n“But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn’t change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good.”\nDemocracy is simply the calculation of votes. This should be respected and is seen as the foundation of legitimate government, but it is not meant to be an exercise in arriving at a preexisting, knowable “will.” The majority shifts and changes across issues. The common man is not romanticized, and the notion of citizenship is broad and legalistic.\nEvil elite\n1,5\nThe evil is embodied in a minority—more specifically, an elite—whose specific identity will vary according to context. Domestically, in Latin America it is often an economic elite, perhaps the “oligarchy,” but it may also be a racial elite; internationally, it may be the United States or the capitalist, industrialized nations or international financiers or simply an ideology such as neoliberalism and capitalism.\n“The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests – and taking money from special interests.”\n“Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests – in less than 2 years – secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public.”\n“She gets rich making you poor.”\n“Hillary’s Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work. She can’t claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.”\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues. In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\n“Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor. The discourse will not encourage or justify illegal, violent actions. There will be great respect for institutions and the rule of law. If data is abused, it is either an innocent mistake or an embarrassing breach of democratic standards.\nOverall Comments (just a few sentences):\nEl discurso presenta los elementos necesarios para ser considerado como populista. En primer lugar se reconoce la apelación al pueblo americano como una entidad virtuosa, construido en oposición a la elite y sus intereses. Segundo, se reconoce de manera clara la identificación de una elite representada por los políticos, los grandes negocios (Wall Street), los intereses especiales y los burócratas los cuales están articulados con la figura de Hillary Clinton. Según Trump, Clinton ha defendido estos intereses y se ha vuelto millonaria a costa del pueblo y sus intereses. Adicionalmente, se reconoce un lenguaje belicoso en relación al desempeño de Clinton como secretaria de Estado. En tercer lugar, se reconoce cierta noción de voluntad general como fuente de legitimidad política y una noción de soberanía nacional (popular) en contra de la globalización. No obstante, la voluntad general no aparece de manera tan clara.\nFinalmente, no se reconoce una noción de cambio radical, sino la identificación de temas específicos como el proteccionismo económico. A partir de los elementos anteriores es posible clasificar el discurso con una nota de 1,3.",

After seven years of Barack Obama, we are not waiting any longer to take our country back. This is not a time for waiting for everything that makes this nation great now hangs in the balance.”\n“Now the moment has arrived for this generation of Americans to rise up to the calling of our heritage.

When I’m our nominee, we are going to grow the conservative movement.

Hillary Clinton’s closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have said on this from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. Guaranteed. Her donors will make sure of it.”\n“Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests.”\n“Our party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system.”\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues. In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\n“I am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new good-paying jobs.\nThe rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability to compete.”\n“A Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor. The discourse will not encourage or justify illegal, violent actions. There will be great respect for institutions and the rule of law. If data is abused, it is either an innocent mistake or an embarrassing breach of democratic standards.\nOverall Comments (just a few sentences):\nEl discurso presenta los elementos necesarios para ser considerado como populista. En primer lugar, se reconoce de manera clara la apelación al pueblo americano como una entidad virtuosa. Segundo, se reconoce de manera clara la identificación de una elite representada por los políticos tradicionales, los intereses especiales y en especial la figura de Hillary Clinton y el presidente Obama. De esta forma, el discurso muestra elementos maniqueos dividiendo la sociedad en dos grupos antagónicos y en donde el pueblo americano va a prevalecer. En tercer lugar, se reconoce cierta noción de voluntad general como fuente de legitimidad política para generar los cambios que se necesitan y poner a América primero. Por sobre una noción de cambio radical, Trump se concentra en temas específicos como política internacional, baja de impuestos, producción de empleo y política energética. A partir de los elementos anteriores es posible clasificar el discurso con una nota de 1,4.",

Thus, the discourse may have a romanticized notion of the people and the idea of a unified popular will (indeed, it must in order to be considered populist), but it avoids bellicose language or references to cosmic proportions or any particular enemy.\nScore here (0, 1,2)\nPopulist\nPluralist\nManichaean vision\n1,0\nIt conveys a Manichaean vision of the world, that is, one that is moral (every issue has a strong moral dimension) and dualistic (everything is in one category or the other, “right” or “wrong,” “good” or “evil”) The implication—or even the stated idea—is that there can be nothing in between, no fence-sitting, no shades of grey. This leads to the use of highly charged, even bellicose language.\n“And tonight despite millions and millions of dollars of false and nasty attacks, despite the entirety of the political establishment coming together against us…”\n“And Justice Scalia's replacement will not be decided by the Washington power brokers. It will be decided by we the people. This election will be a referendum on the Supreme Court.”\n“As president, I will rebuild our military, stand unequivocally with the nation of Israel, and utterly destroy ISIS.”\nThe discourse does not frame issues in moral terms or paint them in black-and-white. Instead, there is a strong tendency to focus on narrow, particular issues. The discourse will emphasize or at least not eliminate the possibility of natural, justifiable differences of opinion.\nThe moral significance of the items mentioned in the speech is heightened by ascribing cosmic proportions to them, that is, by claiming that they affect people everywhere (possibly but not necessarily across the world) and across time. Especially in this last regard, frequent references may be made to a reified notion of “history.” At the same time, the speaker will justify the moral significance of his or her ideas by tying them to national and religious leaders that are generally revered.\nThe discourse will probably not refer to any reified notion of history or use any cosmic proportions. References to the spatial and temporal consequences of issues will be limited to the material reality rather than any mystical connections.\nPopulist notion of the people\n0,5\nAlthough Manichaean, the discourse is still democratic, in the sense that the good is embodied in the will of the majority, which is seen as a unified whole, perhaps but not necessarily expressed in references to the “voluntad del pueblo”; however, the speaker ascribes a kind of unchanging essentialism to that will, rather than letting it be whatever 50 percent of the people want at any particular moment. Thus, this good majority is romanticized, with some notion of the common man (urban or rural) seen as the embodiment of the national ideal.\n“Indeed, the screaming you hear now from across the Potomac is the Washington cartel in full terror that the conservative grassroots are rising up.”\nDemocracy is simply the calculation of votes. This should be respected and is seen as the foundation of legitimate government, but it is not meant to be an exercise in arriving at a preexisting, knowable “will.” The majority shifts and changes across issues. The common man is not romanticized, and the notion of citizenship is broad and legalistic.\nEvil elite\n1,0\nThe evil is embodied in a minority—more specifically, an elite—whose specific identity will vary according to context. Domestically, in Latin America it is often an economic elite, perhaps the “oligarchy,” but it may also be a racial elite; internationally, it may be the United States or the capitalist, industrialized nations or international financiers or simply an ideology such as neoliberalism and capitalism.\n“And tonight despite millions and millions of dollars of false and nasty attacks, despite the entirety of the political establishment coming together against us, South Carolina has given us another remarkable result.”\n“I cannot wait to stand on that debate stage with Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders or whatever other socialist they nominate and make the case against their radical vision of the Constitution that would strip away life and marriage and religious liberty and the Second Amendment and the basic rights of every American citizen.”\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues. In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\n“There is only one candidate who has led the fight against amnesty, who has led the fight against Obamacare, who has led the fight to defend life and marriage and religious liberty, who has led the fight to protect our right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment, who will fight to pass a simple flat tax and abolish the IRS.”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor. The discourse will not encourage or justify illegal, violent actions. There will be great respect for institutions and the rule of law. If data is abused, it is either an innocent mistake or an embarrassing breach of democratic standards.\nOverall Comments (just a few sentences):\nEl discurso no presenta los elementos necesarios para ser considerado como populista, no obstante, posee ciertas características que lo acercan a la calificación 1. En primer lugar, se reconoce la apelación al pueblo americano, en particular el pueblo de Carolina del Sur. Además, apela a los conservadores en cuanto sujeto político. Segundo, se reconoce la identificación de grupos minoritarios tales como el “Washington cartel”, “Washington power brokers” y el “political establishment”, los cuales atentan contra la candidatura. De esta forma, se reconoce una visión maniquea del mundo entre ellos (establishment) y nosotros (el pueblo o la candidatura) a nivel local y entre amigos (Israel) y enemigos (ISIS) a nivel internacional. Tercero, se identifica cierta noción de voluntad general del pueblo y los valores conservadores para que EEUU pueda levantarse.\nAdemás, el discurso muestra un lenguaje de un tono belicoso hacia a las candidaturas demócratas de Clinton y Sanders, como también a la candidatura de Donald Trump. De esta forma es posible reconocer elementos “populistas” en el discurso, por lo que puede ser calificado con una nota general de 0,8.",

Let’s be clear on one thing: the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They are a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with an agenda. And their agenda is to elect the Clintons at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.”\n“Their financial resources are unlimited. Their political resources are unlimited. Their media resources are unlimited. And, most importantly, the depths of their immorality is unlimited.\nOur political establishment has no soul.”\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\n“Our Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives, finally, on November 8th. Join me in taking back our country, and creating a bright and glorious new dawn for our people.”\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues. In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor. The discourse will not encourage or justify illegal, violent actions. There will be great respect for institutions and the rule of law. If data is abused, it is either an innocent mistake or an embarrassing breach of democratic standards.\nOverall Comments (just a few sentences):\nEl discurso presenta los elementos necesarios para ser considerado como populista. En primer lugar, se reconoce de manera clara la apelación al pueblo americano a partir de la articulación de sujetos como los trabajadores, los veteranos, los militares, las ciudades internar y los pueblos fronterizos. Segundo, se reconoce la identificación de una elite representada por “la maquinaria Clinton”, los medios de comunicación y el establishment político. De esta forma, se reconoce una visión maniquea en la medida que esta elite no tiene estándares morales más que beneficiarse a costa del pueblo. En tercer lugar, se reconoce una noción de voluntad general como fuente de legitimidad política que permitirá al pueblo americano superar la crisis en la que se encuentra. Finalmente, el discurso se enfoca en el día de la elección como un nuevo día de la independencia, que permitirá construir un nuevo horizonte para el pueblo americano. A partir de los elementos anteriores es posible clasificar el discurso con una nota de 1,7.",

This leads to the use of highly charged, even bellicose language.\n“If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he’s done to women. There’s never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that’s been so abusive to women.”\n“She won’t say the name and President Obama won’t say the name. But the name is there. It’s radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name.”\nThe discourse does not frame issues in moral terms or paint them in black-and-white. Instead, there is a strong tendency to focus on narrow, particular issues.

Thus, this good majority is romanticized, with some notion of the common man (urban or rural) seen as the embodiment of the national ideal.\nDemocracy is simply the calculation of votes.

And she lied. Now she’s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.”\n“Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her — took massive deductions.”\n“Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.”\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority.

They’ll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me.”\n“But we’re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.

The common man is not romanticized, and the notion of citizenship is broad and legalistic.\nEvil elite\n1,5\nThe evil is embodied in a minority—more specifically, an elite—whose specific identity will vary according to context. Domestically, in Latin America it is often an economic elite, perhaps the “oligarchy,” but it may also be a racial elite; internationally, it may be the United States or the capitalist, industrialized nations or international financiers or simply an ideology such as neoliberalism and capitalism.\n“And I love Mexico. I love Mexico. I love China. I love many of these countries that rip us off because we have leaders that are incompetent and don't know what they're doing.”\n“We're not buying equipment that sells because they have political people, because they take campaign and they give campaign contributions. We are going to get the equipment that they want, not the equipment that they're told to have by senators and congressmen in Washington.”\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues. In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\n“The people in this community -- every time I see them, they want education locally. The parents, the teachers, they want to do it. They don't want bureaucrats telling them how to educate their children. We spend as a nation more for education per pupil than any other nation in the world.”\n“We are going to build our military, which I thank, because a number of the people came down and a number of the pundits watching tonight -- we love our military. We love our military. And by the way, we love our police. Our police are terrific. We love our police. They are not being treated properly.”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor. The discourse will not encourage or justify illegal, violent actions. There will be great respect for institutions and the rule of law. If data is abused, it is either an innocent mistake or an embarrassing breach of democratic standards.\nOverall Comments (just a few sentences):\nEl discurso no presenta los elementos necesarios para ser considerado como populista, no obstante algunos elementos lo acercan a la nota 1. En primer lugar se reconoce la apelación al pueblo americano, pero este no está claramente definido y no es central en el discurso. Segundo, se reconoce de manera clara la identificación de una elite representada por los políticos y líderes tradicionales. Éstos son criticado y considerados como incompetentes que deben favores políticos. Adicionalmente, se reconoce un lenguaje belicoso en relación a los enemigos externos de EEUU (China, Japón, México e ISIS), aclarando que va a potenciar militarmente a EEUU. En tercer lugar, se reconoce cierta noción de voluntad general como fuente de legitimidad política. Esta noción, se reconoce en la identificación de la candidatura como parte de un movimiento que reúne al pueblo (la gente) para volver a América grande de nuevo.\nFinalmente, no se reconoce una noción de cambio radical, sino la identificación de temas específicos como la educación y la seguridad. A partir de los elementos anteriores es posible clasificar el discurso con una nota de 0,9.",

En primer lugar, no se reconoce de manera clara la apelación al pueblo americano. Segundo, se reconoce la identificación de una elite representada por la administración Obama y la figura de Hilary Clinton. De esta forma, se reconoce una visión maniquea haciendo muchos ataques personales y al liderazgo de Clinton. En tercer lugar, no se reconoce una noción de voluntad general como fuente de legitimidad política. Finalmente, el discurso se enfoca en ciertas políticas específicas como incorporar jueces conservadores a la corte suprema, fortalecer las fronteras y construir la muralla en la frontera con Mexico e re-industrializar EEUU para recuperar los empleos que han emigrado del país. A partir de los elementos anteriores es posible clasificar el discurso con una nota de 0,1.",

Note that even if a speech expresses a Manichaean worldview, it is not considered populist if it lacks some notion of a popular will.\nScore here (0, 1,2)\nPopulist\nPluralist\nManichaean vision\n0\nIt conveys a Manichaean vision of the world, that is, one that is moral (every issue has a strong moral dimension) and dualistic (everything is in one category or the other, “right” or “wrong,” “good” or “evil”) The implication—or even the stated idea—is that there can be nothing in between, no fence-sitting, no shades of grey. This leads to the use of highly charged, even bellicose language.\nThe discourse does not frame issues in moral terms or paint them in black-and-white. Instead, there is a strong tendency to focus on narrow, particular issues. The discourse will emphasize or at least not eliminate the possibility of natural, justifiable differences of opinion.\n“Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division; have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.”\n“I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone — all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.”\nThe moral significance of the items mentioned in the speech is heightened by ascribing cosmic proportions to them, that is, by claiming that they affect people everywhere (possibly but not necessarily across the world) and across time. Especially in this last regard, frequent references may be made to a reified notion of “history.” At the same time, the speaker will justify the moral significance of his or her ideas by tying them to national and religious leaders that are generally revered.\nThe discourse will probably not refer to any reified notion of history or use any cosmic proportions. References to the spatial and temporal consequences of issues will be limited to the material reality rather than any mystical connections.\nPopulist notion of the people\n1,5\nAlthough Manichaean, the discourse is still democratic, in the sense that the good is embodied in the will of the majority, which is seen as a unified whole, perhaps but not necessarily expressed in references to the “voluntad del pueblo”; however, the speaker ascribes a kind of unchanging essentialism to that will, rather than letting it be whatever 50 percent of the people want at any particular moment. Thus, this good majority is romanticized, with some notion of the common man (urban or rural) seen as the embodiment of the national ideal.\n“As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their families.”\n“It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will.”\n“The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.”\n“We're going to get to work immediately for the American people. And we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your president.”\nDemocracy is simply the calculation of votes. This should be respected and is seen as the foundation of legitimate government, but it is not meant to be an exercise in arriving at a preexisting, knowable “will.” The majority shifts and changes across issues. The common man is not romanticized, and the notion of citizenship is broad and legalistic.\nEvil elite\n0\nThe evil is embodied in a minority—more specifically, an elite—whose specific identity will vary according to context. Domestically, in Latin America it is often an economic elite, perhaps the “oligarchy,” but it may also be a racial elite; internationally, it may be the United States or the capitalist, industrialized nations or international financiers or simply an ideology such as neoliberalism and capitalism.\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues. In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\n“We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.\nWe will also finally take care of our great veterans.”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor.

En primer lugar, se reconoce de manera clara la apelación al pueblo americano como un grupo social olvidado que por fin recupera su voz. Segundo, no se reconoce la identificación de una elite que atente contra los intereses del pueblo. De esta forma, por sobre una visión maniquea el discurso presenta elementos pluralistas en donde todos los actores son invitados a hablar. En tercer lugar, se reconoce una noción de voluntad general como fuente de legitimidad política que permitirá al pueblo americano y el movimiento creado por Trump lograr un mejor futuro. Finalmente, el discurso se enfoca en algunas políticas publicas específicas como la reducción de impuestos, la construcción de infraestructura, la generación de empleos, apoyo a los veteranos, entre otras.

I mean, if she hasn’t straighten it out by now, she’s not going to straighten it out in the next four years. It’s just going to become worse and worse.”\n“We’ve got about a 20 point lead.

En primer lugar, no se reconoce de manera clara alguna apelación al pueblo. Sin embargo, se observa una visión romántica de los mineros y la idea de nación americana. Segundo, se reconoce de manera clara la identificación de una elite representada por los políticos tradicionales y articulada con la figura de Hillary Clinton. Se puede observar un componente maniqueo cuando Trump se refiere a Clinton como alguien que no puede ser un buen presidente. Además, se observa un lenguaje belicoso cuando refiere a la necesidad de eliminar a ISIS. En tercer lugar, se no reconoce una noción de voluntad general como fuente de legitimidad política.\nFinalmente, no se reconoce una noción de cambio radical, sino la identificación de temas específicos como el proteccionismo económico, la generación de empleo, la reconstrucción de la infraestructura del país e invertir en las fuerzas militares. A partir de los elementos anteriores es posible clasificar el discurso con una nota de 0,5.",

Thus, the discourse may have a romanticized notion of the people and the idea of a unified popular will (indeed, it must in order to be considered populist), but it avoids bellicose language or references to cosmic proportions or any particular enemy.\nScore here (0, 1,2)\nPopulist\nPluralist\nManichaean vision\n1,5\nIt conveys a Manichaean vision of the world, that is, one that is moral (every issue has a strong moral dimension) and dualistic (everything is in one category or the other, “right” or “wrong,” “good” or “evil”) The implication—or even the stated idea—is that there can be nothing in between, no fence-sitting, no shades of grey. This leads to the use of highly charged, even bellicose language.\n“We made a promise to these heroes. You defend America, and America will defend you. But that promise has been broken by our politicians, like so many other promises our country has made – not only to its veterans, but to its citizens as a whole.”\n“Perhaps it is easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they are being paid millions of dollars to read speeches to Wall Street executives – instead of spending time with real people in real pain.”\n“There are two Americas: the ruling class, and the groups it favors, and then everyone else.”\n“The fact is, she helped create our rigged system. Hillary Clinton’s America is a country where the elite get one standard they so richly deserve. Of treatment and everybody else gets second-class treatment.”\nThe discourse does not frame issues in moral terms or paint them in black-and-white. Instead, there is a strong tendency to focus on narrow, particular issues. The discourse will emphasize or at least not eliminate the possibility of natural, justifiable differences of opinion.\nThe moral significance of the items mentioned in the speech is heightened by ascribing cosmic proportions to them, that is, by claiming that they affect people everywhere (possibly but not necessarily across the world) and across time. Especially in this last regard, frequent references may be made to a reified notion of “history.” At the same time, the speaker will justify the moral significance of his or her ideas by tying them to national and religious leaders that are generally revered.\nThe discourse will probably not refer to any reified notion of history or use any cosmic proportions. References to the spatial and temporal consequences of issues will be limited to the material reality rather than any mystical connections.\nPopulist notion of the people\n0\nAlthough Manichaean, the discourse is still democratic, in the sense that the good is embodied in the will of the majority, which is seen as a unified whole, perhaps but not necessarily expressed in references to the “voluntad del pueblo”; however, the speaker ascribes a kind of unchanging essentialism to that will, rather than letting it be whatever 50 percent of the people want at any particular moment. Thus, this good majority is romanticized, with some notion of the common man (urban or rural) seen as the embodiment of the national ideal.\nDemocracy is simply the calculation of votes. This should be respected and is seen as the foundation of legitimate government, but it is not meant to be an exercise in arriving at a preexisting, knowable “will.” The majority shifts and changes across issues. The common man is not romanticized, and the notion of citizenship is broad and legalistic.\nEvil elite\n1,5\nThe evil is embodied in a minority—more specifically, an elite—whose specific identity will vary according to context. Domestically, in Latin America it is often an economic elite, perhaps the “oligarchy,” but it may also be a racial elite; internationally, it may be the United States or the capitalist, industrialized nations or international financiers or simply an ideology such as neoliberalism and capitalism.\n“Clearly, Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law. Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.”\n“Her conduct was willful, intentional, and unlawful – and her repeated false statements about her conduct prove that she was fully aware of her guilt. This was not just extreme carelessness with classified material – which is still totally disqualifying. This is calculated, deliberate, premeditated misconduct –followed by a cover-up that included false statements and lies to Congress, the media and the American people.”\n“The fact is, she helped create our rigged system. Hillary Clinton’s America is a country where the elite get one standard they so richly deserve.”\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues. In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\n“Fixing this corruption will be one of my highest priorities – and it will happen. It will be fixed.”\n“Here is my 10 step plan to ensure quality, timely care for every Veteran in America:”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor. The discourse will not encourage or justify illegal, violent actions. There will be great respect for institutions and the rule of law. If data is abused, it is either an innocent mistake or an embarrassing breach of democratic standards.\nOverall Comments (just a few sentences):\nEl discurso presenta algunos de los elementos necesarios para ser considerado como populista. En primer lugar se reconoce la apelación al pueblo americano (las personas reales, los trabajadores), el cual es construido en oposición a la elite económica y política. Segundo, se reconoce de manera clara la identificación de una elite representada por los políticos, los ejecutivos de Wall Street y la clase dirigente los cuales están articulados con la figura de Hillary Clinton. Según Trump, Clinton ha defendido estos intereses y ha defendido la corrupción como medio para alcanzar sus fines. En tercer lugar, se no reconoce una noción de voluntad general como fuente de legitimidad política.\nFinalmente, no se reconoce una noción de cambio radical, sino la identificación de temas específicos como el fin de la corrupción y políticas a favor de los veteranos de guerra.

Especially in this last regard, frequent references may be made to a reified notion of “history.” At the same time, the speaker will justify the moral significance of his or her ideas by tying them to national and religious leaders that are generally revered.\nThe discourse will probably not refer to any reified notion of history or use any cosmic proportions. References to the spatial and temporal consequences of issues will be limited to the material reality rather than any mystical connections.\nPopulist notion of the people\nAlthough Manichaean, the discourse is still democratic, in the sense that the good is embodied in the will of the majority, which is seen as a unified whole, perhaps but not necessarily expressed in references to the “voluntad del pueblo”; however, the speaker ascribes a kind of unchanging essentialism to that will, rather than letting it be whatever 50 percent of the people want at any particular moment. Thus, this good majority is romanticized, with some notion of the common man (urban or rural) seen as the embodiment of the national ideal.\nDemocracy is simply the calculation of votes. This should be respected and is seen as the foundation of legitimate government, but it is not meant to be an exercise in arriving at a preexisting, knowable “will.” The majority shifts and changes across issues. The common man is not romanticized, and the notion of citizenship is broad and legalistic.\nEvil elite\nThe evil is embodied in a minority—more specifically, an elite—whose specific identity will vary according to context. Domestically, in Latin America it is often an economic elite, perhaps the “oligarchy,” but it may also be a racial elite; internationally, it may be the United States or the capitalist, industrialized nations or international financiers or simply an ideology such as neoliberalism and capitalism.\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues. In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor. The discourse will not encourage or justify illegal, violent actions. There will be great respect for institutions and the rule of law. If data is abused, it is either an innocent mistake or an embarrassing breach of democratic standards.",

You decided to stay home, and that's OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over. And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.”\n“Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.

When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's a defective agreement. It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.”\n“And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.”\n“Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn't work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.”\n“The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is. They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.”\n“Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed.”\n“That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.”\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority.

En primer lugar, no se reconoce de manera clara la apelación al pueblo americano. Segundo, se reconoce de manera clara la identificación de una elite malvada representada por los políticos tradicionales y la prensa, haciendo un especial énfasis en el Partido Demócrata, Hillary Clinton y Barack Obama, como quienes han tomado malas decisiones y han llevado a que EEUU esté en crisis. De esta forma, se reconoce una visión maniquea haciendo muchos ataques a Hillary Clinton. En tercer lugar, no se reconoce una noción de voluntad general como fuente de legitimidad política. Más bien aparece de forma fuerte la idea de soberanía nacional. Finalmente, el discurso se enfoca en ciertas políticas específicas como la generación de empleo a través de una baja de impuestos, fortalecer la política migratoria, renegociar los tratados internacionales y reconstruir la infraestructura del país. A partir de los elementos anteriores es posible clasificar el discurso con una nota de 0,2.",

References to the spatial and temporal consequences of issues will be limited to the material reality rather than any mystical connections.\nPopulist notion of the people\n1,3\nAlthough Manichaean, the discourse is still democratic, in the sense that the good is embodied in the will of the majority, which is seen as a unified whole, perhaps but not necessarily expressed in references to the “voluntad del pueblo”; however, the speaker ascribes a kind of unchanging essentialism to that will, rather than letting it be whatever 50 percent of the people want at any particular moment. Thus, this good majority is romanticized, with some notion of the common man (urban or rural) seen as the embodiment of the national ideal.\n“The silent majority is back. In 10 days, we are going to win the state of Arizona and we are going to win back the White House.”\n“This will be the year the American people say: enough is enough.\nThis will be the year the American people break with the bitter failures of the past and embrace a new and optimistic future.”\n“We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community, and every American family, who yearns for a better future.”\nDemocracy is simply the calculation of votes. This should be respected and is seen as the foundation of legitimate government, but it is not meant to be an exercise in arriving at a preexisting, knowable “will.” The majority shifts and changes across issues. The common man is not romanticized, and the notion of citizenship is broad and legalistic.\nEvil elite\n1,5\nThe evil is embodied in a minority—more specifically, an elite—whose specific identity will vary according to context. Domestically, in Latin America it is often an economic elite, perhaps the “oligarchy,” but it may also be a racial elite; internationally, it may be the United States or the capitalist, industrialized nations or international financiers or simply an ideology such as neoliberalism and capitalism.\n“The WikiLeaks revelations have exposed criminal corruption at the highest levels of our government.”\n“A vote for Hillary is a vote to surrender our government to public corruption, graft and cronyism that threatens the survival of our Constitutional system itself.”\n“Government corruption spreads outward, like a cancer, infecting the whole operation of our government.”\nThe discourse avoids a conspiratorial tone and does not single out any evil ruling minority. It avoids labeling opponents as evil and may not even mention them in an effort to maintain a positive tone and keep passions low.\nCrucially, the evil minority is or was recently in charge and subverted the system to its own interests, against those of the good majority or the people. Thus, systemic change is/was required, often expressed in terms such as “revolution” or “liberation” of the people from their “immiseration” or bondage, even if technically it comes about through elections.\n“Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington.”\nThe discourse does not argue for systemic change but, as mentioned above, focuses on particular issues. In the words of Laclau, it is a politics of “differences” rather than “hegemony.”\n“We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; stop the massive inflow of refugees and keep Radical Islamic Terrorist out of our country; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; reduce surging crime and support the men and women of law enforcement; provide school choice and put an end to Common Core; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States”\nBecause of the moral baseness of the threatening minority, non-democratic means may be openly justified or at least the minority’s continued enjoyment of these will be seen as a generous concession by the people; the speech itself may exaggerate or abuse data to make this point, and the language will show a bellicosity towards the opposition that is incendiary and condescending, lacking the decorum that one shows a worthy opponent.\nFormal rights and liberties are openly respected, and the opposition is treated with courtesy and as a legitimate political actor. The discourse will not encourage or justify illegal, violent actions. There will be great respect for institutions and the rule of law. If data is abused, it is either an innocent mistake or an embarrassing breach of democratic standards.\nOverall Comments (just a few sentences):\nEl discurso presenta los elementos necesarios para ser considerado como populista. En primer lugar, se reconoce de manera clara la apelación al pueblo americano como una entidad virtuosa que se define en oposición a un gobierno y una elite política corrupta. Segundo, se reconoce la identificación de una elite representada por Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, el establishment político y los intereses especiales. De esta forma, se reconoce una visión maniquea en la medida que esta elite no tiene estándares morales más que beneficiarse a costa del pueblo. En tercer lugar, se reconoce una noción de voluntad general como fuente de legitimidad política que permitirá al pueblo americano y el movimiento creado por Trump superar la crisis en la que se encuentra EEUU y volver a ser una gran nación. Finalmente, el discurso se enfoca en algunas políticas publicas específicas como la reducción de impuestos, eliminar las regulaciones estatales, dejar de recibir refugiados desde medio oriente, la construcción de infraestructura, la defensa de la segunda enmienda, entre otras. A partir de los elementos anteriores es posible clasificar el discurso con una nota de 1,4.",
