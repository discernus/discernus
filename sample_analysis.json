        "summary": "This text exhibits a balanced moral framework with moderate scores across both positive and negative dimensions. While it maintains a slight preference for positive moral values (MPS: 0.80), the presence of pragmatic concerns and acknowledgment of challenges suggests a nuanced approach rather than pure idealism. The central positioning of the COM indicates a narrative that seeks to bridge multiple moral perspectives."
