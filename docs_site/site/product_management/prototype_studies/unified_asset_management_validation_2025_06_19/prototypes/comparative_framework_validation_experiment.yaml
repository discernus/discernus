  version: "v1.0"
  description: >
    Comparative validation study testing the effectiveness of dipole-based frameworks
    (IDITI) versus non-dipole frameworks (Three Wells Political) on a categorized
    validation corpus. Tests both framework types on identical texts to measure
    methodological effectiveness and academic credibility.

# Experiment design
study_design:
  type: "comparative_validation"
  methodology: "same_corpus_multiple_frameworks"
  control_strategy: "identical_texts_different_frameworks"
  
  research_questions:
    - "Do dipole frameworks (binary opposition) provide clearer scoring patterns?"
    - "Do non-dipole frameworks (independent competition) capture more nuanced analysis?"
    - "Which framework type demonstrates better theoretical coherence on categorized texts?"
    - "How do framework types differ in analyzing dignity vs tribalism themes?"
