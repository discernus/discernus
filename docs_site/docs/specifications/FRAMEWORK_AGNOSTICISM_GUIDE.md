# Framework Agnosticism Guide

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: June 12, 2025  
**Status**: Strategic Foundation Document

## Overview

This document establishes the **Framework Agnosticism Principle** - the fundamental separation between the general Narrative Gravity Maps methodology and domain-specific framework implementations. This separation is critical for academic credibility, broader adoption, and theoretical clarity.

## The Framework Agnosticism Principle

### Core Concept

**Platform Level**: The Narrative Gravity Maps methodology is a general system for analyzing persuasive discourse through configurable analytical frameworks. It is domain-neutral and framework-agnostic.

**Framework Level**: Specific implementations that apply the methodology to particular domains (political discourse, business communication, educational content, etc.) using domain-specific conceptual frameworks.

### Why This Matters

1. **Academic Credibility**: Shows the methodology transcends any specific domain
2. **Broader Adoption**: Researchers in any field can see applicability to their domain  
3. **Theoretical Clarity**: Methodology separated from specific implementations
4. **Framework Flexibility**: Clear path for creating frameworks for any analytical domain

## Language Standards

### Platform-Level Language (Framework-Agnostic)

**Core Methodology Terms:**
- "Gravity wells" - not "moral forces" or "political forces"
- "Conceptual forces" - not domain-specific force types
- "Analytical frameworks" - not "moral frameworks" or "political frameworks"
- "Framework-defined forces" - not "integrative/disintegrative forces"
- "Coordinate systems" - mathematical positioning concepts
- "Persuasive discourse" - not "political discourse" or "moral discourse"
- "Domain-appropriate frameworks" - acknowledging domain specificity

**Analysis Capabilities:**
- "Framework-agnostic analysis"
- "Configurable analytical frameworks for any domain"
- "Systematic analysis of persuasive discourse across domains"
- "Universal methodology applicable to any persuasive discourse domain"

**Research Applications:**
- "Persuasive Discourse Analysis" (not "Political Speech Analysis")
- "Argumentative Structure Analysis" (not "Policy Debate Analysis")
- "Cross-Cultural Research using cultural frameworks"
- "Historical Analysis with domain-appropriate frameworks"

### Framework-Level Language (Domain-Specific)

**Within Framework Context Only:**
- "Moral," "political," "integrative," "disintegrative"
- "Good," "bad," "positive," "negative" (when framework-defined)
- Domain-specific terminology (civic virtue, political spectrum, etc.)
- Normative language (when appropriate to the framework)

**Framework Descriptions:**
- Always qualify as "domain-specific examples"
- Make clear they demonstrate platform capabilities
- Acknowledge they are implementations, not inherent platform features

## Example Framework Positioning

### ✅ Correct Framework-Agnostic Description

```
The Narrative Gravity Maps platform includes 5 domain-specific frameworks 
demonstrating the methodology's versatility:

1. Civic Virtue Framework (Political discourse analysis)
   - Domain: Political discourse analysis
   - Wells: Framework-defined attraction/repulsion forces for civic analysis
   - Use case: Political speeches, policy debates, campaign rhetoric

Note: These are examples demonstrating the platform's capability to 
support frameworks from any analytical domain.
```

### ❌ Incorrect Framework-Specific Description

```
The Narrative Gravity Maps platform analyzes moral and political forces 
within texts using integrative and disintegrative wells:

1. Civic Virtue Framework (Primary)
   - Focus: Moral analysis of political discourse  
   - Wells: 5 integrative virtues + 5 disintegrative forces
   - Use case: Political speeches, policy debates
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Documentation Standards

1. **Platform Documentation**: Must use framework-agnostic language
2. **Framework Documentation**: May use domain-specific language within context
3. **Examples**: Always clarify as demonstrations of platform capabilities
4. **Use Cases**: Present as domain-specific applications, not platform limitations

### Code Implementation

1. **Core Engine**: Framework-agnostic variable names and docstrings
2. **Framework Modules**: Domain-specific implementations clearly scoped
3. **API Endpoints**: General endpoints that accept any framework
4. **Documentation**: Clear separation between methodology and implementation

### Academic Writing

1. **Methodology Sections**: Focus on general framework-agnostic principles
2. **Implementation Sections**: Present specific frameworks as examples
3. **Results Sections**: Emphasize methodology validation across domains
4. **Discussion Sections**: Highlight broader applicability beyond examples

## Domain Extension Examples
