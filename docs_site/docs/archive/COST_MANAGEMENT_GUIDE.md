# HuggingFace Inference Endpoints Cost Management Guide

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Avoid Unexpected Charges**

**HuggingFace Inference Endpoints charge by UPTIME, not usage!** You pay every minute an endpoint is running, even if you're not making requests.

## 💰 **Billing Model Explained**

### **What You Pay For:**
- ✅ **Uptime**: Every minute endpoint is "Running" 
- ✅ **Initialization time**: While endpoint starts up
- ❌ **NOT per request**: Unlike OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- ❌ **NOT per token**: Unlike traditional LLM APIs

### **Billing Formula:**
```
Cost = Hourly Rate × (Hours Running × Min Replicas + Scale-up Hours × Additional Replicas)
```

## 🎯 **Recommended Strategy for Your Testing**

### **Phase 1: Budget Testing Setup**
```
✅ Deploy 3 endpoints with MANUAL management:
   - mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3     ($0.8/hour)
   - meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct       ($0.8/hour)  
   - microsoft/phi-4                         ($1.8/hour)

✅ Set Min Replicas = 0, Max Replicas = 1
✅ Enable "Auto Scale-to-Zero" after 15 minutes
```

### **Phase 2: Active Testing Protocol**
1. **Before Testing Session:**
   - Resume all endpoints you need
   - Wait 2-5 minutes for initialization
   - Run your test suite
   
2. **During Testing:**
   - Run tests efficiently in batches
   - Monitor costs in dashboard
   
3. **After Testing Session:**
   - **IMMEDIATELY PAUSE** all endpoints
   - Check billing dashboard
   - Save results

## 🛡️ **Cost Protection Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Manual Control (Safest)**
```python
# Programmatic endpoint management
endpoint.pause()    # Stop billing immediately
endpoint.resume()   # Start billing again
endpoint.wait()     # Wait until ready
```

### **Strategy 2: Auto Scale-to-Zero**
- **Pros**: Automatic shutdown after 15 min inactivity
- **Cons**: Still counts against GPU quota, cold start delays
- **Setup**: Enable in endpoint settings

### **Strategy 3: Testing Windows**
- **Schedule testing sessions**: 2-3 hours blocks
- **Batch all tests**: Run multiple frameworks together
- **Immediate shutdown**: Pause endpoints right after

## 📊 **Cost Examples for Your Testing**

### **Conservative Testing (2 hours/day)**
```
3 endpoints × $3.4/hour × 2 hours/day × 5 days/week = $34/week
```

### **Intensive Testing (8 hours/day)**
```
3 endpoints × $3.4/hour × 8 hours/day × 5 days/week = $136/week
```

### **Accidental Always-On (24/7)**
```
3 endpoints × $3.4/hour × 24 hours × 7 days = $571.2/week ⚠️
```

## ⚡ **Quick Setup Commands**

### **Deploy with Cost Controls:**
```python
endpoint = create_inference_endpoint(
    endpoint_name,
    # ... other params ...
    min_replica=0,          # 🛡️ Can scale to zero
    max_replica=1,          # 🛡️ Limit max scaling
    type="protected",
)

# Immediately pause after creation
endpoint.pause()
```

### **Safe Testing Pattern:**
```python
# Start testing session
endpoint.resume()
endpoint.wait()

# Run your tests
test_results = run_multi_llm_tests()

# End testing session  
endpoint.pause()
print(f"Session complete. Billing stopped.")
```

## 🔧 **Monitoring and Alerts**

### **Dashboard Monitoring:**
1. **Usage & Cost tab**: Real-time billing
2. **Analytics tab**: Usage patterns  
3. **Settings tab**: Auto-scaling config

### **Cost Alerts:**
- Set up billing alerts in your HF account
- Monitor daily spend limits
- Check endpoint status regularly

## 🚀 **Your Immediate Action Plan**

### **Step 1: Deploy with Safety**
1. Deploy 3 endpoints with `min_replica=0`
2. Enable auto scale-to-zero (15 min)
3. **Immediately pause** all endpoints after creation

### **Step 2: Test Safely**
1. Resume 1 endpoint at a time
2. Run quick test (< 30 minutes)
3. Pause immediately after testing
4. Repeat for other endpoints

### **Step 3: Scale Gradually**
1. Once comfortable, resume multiple endpoints
2. Run comprehensive test suite
3. Always pause when done

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

- **Start small**: Test 1 endpoint first to understand billing
- **Use timers**: Set phone alarms to remind you to pause endpoints
- **Batch testing**: Run all 3 frameworks in one session
- **Monitor actively**: Check billing dashboard every hour during testing
- **Pause by default**: Only resume when actively testing

## 🎯 **Bottom Line**

**Manual pause/resume is your safest bet for testing.** Auto-scaling helps but doesn't eliminate costs. The key is treating these like cloud servers that need to be turned off when not in use, not like API services that charge per call.

With proper management, your testing costs should be **$20-50/week** instead of hundreds per week!
