# Conversational Interface Architecture Proposal
## Narrative Gravity Research Workbench Enhancement

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 10 June 2025  
**Author**: Development Team  
**Status**: Draft for Expert Review  

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal evaluates architectural approaches for implementing conversational AI interfaces within the Narrative Gravity Research Workbench. After comprehensive analysis of available technologies, we recommend adopting **NLUX** as the primary React-based conversational framework, integrated directly into our existing React frontend architecture.

**Key Decision**: Abandon Chainlit hybrid approach in favor of React-native conversational UI framework.

**Primary Recommendation**: NLUX + existing React Research Workbench architecture.

**Timeline Impact**: 4-6 weeks faster development vs. hybrid approach.

**Risk Mitigation**: Proven production frameworks, extensive fallback options.

- Multiple adapter system (LangChain, Vercel AI, custom backends)
- Multimodal components (text, images, data visualizations)
- React/TypeScript native with modern patterns
- Enterprise support available
- Active development with regular releases

**Technical Integration:**
```javascript
// Direct FastAPI integration example
const researchAdapter = useAsStreamAdapter(async (message) => {
  return fetch('/api/narrative-gravity/chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message,
      research_context: currentFramework,
      session_id: researchSessionId
    })
  });
});
```

**Research-Specific Features:**
- Context-aware conversations
- File upload/download support
- Custom component rendering
- Theme customization
- Event system for research workflow integration

#### **assistant-ui (Alternative Option)**
**Strengths:**
- ChatGPT-like UX out of the box

- shadcn/ui integration (modern design system)
- Built-in tool calling support
- TypeScript-first approach

**Considerations:**
- Newer project (higher velocity, less stability)
- More opinionated design patterns
- Limited customization vs. NLUX

#### **Chatscope (Stability Fallback)**
**Strengths:**
- Most mature React chat library (39 releases)
- Battle-tested in production environments
- Comprehensive component library
- Well-documented with extensive examples
- Conservative update cycle (stability focus)

**Limitations:**
- Generic chat focus (not AI/LLM optimized)
- Less sophisticated streaming support
- Manual implementation of AI-specific features

```

#### **Implementation Approach**

**Phase 1: Core Integration (Week 1-2)**
```javascript
// Minimal viable conversational interface
import { AiChat, useAsStreamAdapter } from '@nlux/react';

const ResearchWorkbench = () => {
  const adapter = useAsStreamAdapter(streamingChatEndpoint);
  
  return (
    <div className="workbench-layout">
      <ResearchLibraryPanel />
      <AiChat 
        adapter={adapter}
        conversationOptions={{ enableContext: true }}
        displayOptions={{ colorScheme: "dark" }}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Phase 2: Research-Specific Features (Week 3-4)**
- Framework selection integration
- Experiment parameter passing
- Results visualization in chat
- File upload for research documents

**Phase 3: Advanced Workflows (Week 5-6)**
- Multi-turn research conversations
- Cross-framework comparison tools
- Export functionality
- Advanced prompt engineering tools

### 3.2 Alternative Architecture: Chatscope (Stability Focus)

If maximum stability is prioritized over AI-native features:
- Use Chatscope as base chat interface
- Manually implement streaming with server-sent events
- Custom components for research-specific features
- More development work but proven stability

## 4. Rationale for React-Native Approach

### 4.1 Why Not Chainlit Hybrid?

**Technical Complexity Issues:**
- iframe embedding creates cross-frame communication complexity
- State synchronization between React and Chainlit instances
- Deployment pipeline multiplication (React + Chainlit services)
- Different technology stacks require separate expertise

**Development Velocity Impact:**
- Debugging requires knowledge of both React and Chainlit
- Feature development spans multiple codebases
- Testing complexity increases significantly
- Maintenance burden grows over time

**Performance Considerations:**
- Cross-frame communication overhead
- Memory usage from multiple framework instances
- Potential security considerations with iframe embedding

### 4.2 React-Native Benefits

**Architectural Unity:**
- Single technology stack (React + FastAPI)
- Consistent state management patterns
- Unified deployment pipeline
- Single development environment

**Development Efficiency:**
- Leverage existing React expertise
- Reuse existing components and patterns
- Faster debugging and iteration cycles
- Consistent styling and theming

**Integration Advantages:**
- Direct access to research library panel state
- Seamless data flow with PostgreSQL backend
- No cross-framework communication layer
- Native performance characteristics

### 5.1 Technical Risks

| Risk Category | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| NLUX adoption/support | Low | Medium | Fallback to Chatscope; active community |
| Integration complexity | Medium | High | Phased implementation; extensive testing |
| Performance issues | Low | Medium | React optimization; streaming design |
| Feature limitations | Medium | Medium | Custom component development |

### 5.2 Project Risks

**Development Timeline:**
- **Risk**: Underestimating React-specific complexity
- **Mitigation**: Phased approach, early prototyping

**Team Expertise:**
- **Risk**: Limited React/conversational UI experience
