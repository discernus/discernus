- **Layer 2**: LLM response validation (JSON format, score ranges, completeness)  
- **Layer 3**: Statistical coherence (default value detection, variance analysis)
- **Layer 4**: Mathematical consistency (coordinate calculation verification)
- **Layer 5**: Cross-validation (second opinion triggers)
- **Layer 6**: Anomaly detection (outliers, symmetry, artifacts)
**Status**: ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY - DO NOT REPLACE
**Usage**: `validate_llm_analysis(text, framework, response, scores)`

### ‚úÖ ComponentQualityValidator (`src/narrative_gravity/development/quality_assurance.py`)
**What it does**: Validates prompt templates, frameworks, weighting methodologies
- 15+ mathematical checks for weighting algorithms
- Academic standards validation
- Component compatibility testing
**Status**: ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY
**Usage**: `validator.validate_prompt_template(template)`

### ‚ùå ArchitecturalComplianceValidator (`scripts/architectural_compliance_validator.py`)
**What it does**: File existence checks and string matching
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è INFERIOR REPLACEMENT - Consider deprecating
**Problem**: Dumbed-down version of real QA systems above

## üß™ Experiment Execution Systems

### ‚úÖ DeclarativeExperimentExecutor (`scripts/execute_experiment_definition.py`)
**What it does**: YAML-driven experiment execution with QA integration
**Status**: ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY
**Features**: Built-in QA validation, cost controls, replication

### ‚úÖ EnhancedExperimentOrchestrator (`scripts/production/comprehensive_experiment_orchestrator.py`)
**What it does**: Multi-phase experiment orchestration with framework-aware architecture
**Status**: ‚úÖ CORE INFRASTRUCTURE WORKING - IMPORT ISSUES AFFECT ENHANCED ANALYSIS
**Architectural Breakthrough**: Unified YAML framework architecture eliminates configuration mismatches
**Working Components**:
- Framework integration and transaction management
- LLM connections (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI)
- Asset management and intelligent output routing
- Database graceful degradation
**Blocked Components**: Enhanced analysis pipeline (import path technical debt)
**Usage**: `PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/production/comprehensive_experiment_orchestrator.py experiment.yaml`

## üìä Data Export & Analysis

### ‚úÖ QAEnhancedDataExporter (`src/narrative_gravity/academic/data_export.py`)
**What it does**: Academic data export with integrated QA validation
**Status**: ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY
**Features**: CSV, R, Stata, JSON export with confidence scores

### ‚úÖ AcademicAnalysisPipeline (`src/narrative_gravity/cli/academic_analysis_pipeline.py`)
**What it does**: Complete academic workflow orchestration
**Status**: ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY

## üèóÔ∏è Framework Management

### ‚úÖ FrameworkManager (`src/narrative_gravity/framework_manager.py`)

- `src/narrative_gravity/utils/llm_quality_assurance.py` - Framework-aware QA coordinate calculations
**Breakthrough**: Eliminated fundamental mismatch between YAML experiment definitions and JSON circular engine configuration
**Result**: All Discernus components now use unified YAML framework architecture

## ‚ö†Ô∏è TECHNICAL DEBT

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Import Path Issues (Widespread)
**Problem**: `No module named 'src'` and `No module named 'scripts'` errors affecting multiple systems
**Affected Systems**: Most CLI tools, enhanced analysis pipeline, orchestrator components
**Workaround**: Use `PYTHONPATH=src` for all operations
**Status**: Technical debt preventing full enhanced analysis pipeline completion
**Impact**: Core systems work, but enhanced analysis components blocked

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced Analysis Pipeline Components
**Affected Files**:
- `scripts/extract_experiment_results.py`
- `scripts/statistical_hypothesis_testing.py` 
- `scripts/interrater_reliability_analysis.py`
- `scripts/generate_comprehensive_visualizations.py`
**Status**: Import path issues prevent loading despite core functionality being designed
**Workaround**: Core orchestrator provides graceful degradation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATION CANDIDATES

### ‚ùå AI Academic Advisor "Methodology"
**Problem**: Rebranded file existence checks as "AI methodology"
**Better Alternative**: Use existing LLMQualityAssuranceSystem
**Action**: Remove or merge with real QA systems

## üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTION RULES

### Rule 1: Search First
```bash
# ALWAYS run before building anything:
python3 scripts/applications/check_existing_systems.py "functionality description"
# OR manually search:
grep -r "quality.assurance\|validation\|QA" src/ docs/ scripts/
```

### Rule 2: Check This Inventory
**Before building**: "Do we already have something that does this?"

### Rule 3: Use PYTHONPATH
```bash
# ALWAYS use PYTHONPATH for CLI operations:
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/any_script.py
# OR set environment variable:
export PYTHONPATH=src
```

### Rule 4: Test with Production Orchestrator
```bash
# Validate new components with working orchestrator:
PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/production/comprehensive_experiment_orchestrator.py \
    research_workspaces/test_workspace/experiments/test.yaml --force-reregister
```

### Rule 5: Explicit Deprecation
**When replacing**: Document WHY the new version is better

### Rule 6: Keep What Works
**If existing system works**: Enhance it, don't replace it

## üìä PRODUCTION VALIDATION STATUS (June 20, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Validated Working Systems
- Framework-aware orchestrator infrastructure
- YAML unified architecture (eliminates config mismatches)
- LLM connections (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI)
- Asset management and transaction system
- Intelligent output routing for research workspaces

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Systems Blocked by Technical Debt
- Enhanced analysis pipeline (import path issues)
- Most CLI tools (require PYTHONPATH)
- Statistical analysis components (import path issues)

### üéØ Current Production Recommendation
Use validated orchestrator workflow for framework architecture validation and graceful degradation when enhanced components have import issues.
