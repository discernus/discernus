# LLM Quality Assurance System

## Problem Statement

During analysis of experiment results, we discovered a critical "silent failure" issue where LLM parsing failures created mathematically valid but artificially precise results. Specifically:

- **Case**: Roosevelt 1933 inaugural address analysis
- **Issue**: LLM successfully parsed 2/10 civic virtue wells, failed on 8/10
- **Artifact**: Failed wells defaulted to 0.3, creating perfect mathematical cancellation
- **Result**: Narrative position at exactly (0.000, 0.000) - appeared precise but was 80% artificial

This highlights the fundamental **error detection problem**: LLM failures can create results that pass basic validation but contain significant artificial data.

## Design Philosophy

The solution implements "virtual eyes on" - systematic second opinions and coherence checks throughout the analysis pipeline. Quality assurance operates at multiple layers to catch different types of failures.

## Multi-Layered Validation Architecture

### Layer 1: Input Validation
**Purpose**: Ensure analysis prerequisites are met

**Checks**:
- Text quality (length, readability, completeness)
- Framework compatibility (genre, style, content alignment)
- Required metadata presence
- Character encoding and formatting

**Thresholds**:
- Minimum text length: 100 characters
- Maximum text length: 50,000 characters
- Required fields: title, content, framework_id

### Layer 2: LLM Response Validation
**Purpose**: Detect parsing and format failures

**Checks**:
- JSON format validation
- Required field presence
- Score range validation (0.0-1.0)
- Well completeness (all framework wells present)
- Explanation quality (non-empty, substantive)

**Quality Indicators**:
- ✅ All wells parsed successfully
- ⚠️ 1-2 wells missing explanations
- ❌ >50% wells at default values (0.3)

### Layer 3: Statistical Coherence Validation
**Purpose**: Detect artificial patterns and mathematical artifacts

**Checks**:
- **Default Value Ratio**: Percentage of wells at default value (0.3)
- **Score Variance**: Distribution spread across all wells
- **Pattern Detection**: Uniform scores, symmetric artifacts
- **Position Analysis**: Exactly zero coordinates, perfect cancellation

**Anomaly Thresholds**:
- Default ratio >50%: CRITICAL (parsing failure)
- Score variance <0.05: WARNING (artificial uniformity)
- Exactly (0,0) position: SUSPICIOUS (mathematical artifact)
- All scores identical: CRITICAL (total parsing failure)

### Layer 4: Mathematical Consistency Verification
**Purpose**: Validate coordinate calculations and transformations

**Checks**:
- Coordinate calculation verification
- Vector sum validation
- Magnitude and angle consistency
- Framework-specific mathematical constraints

**Verification Process**:
1. Recalculate coordinates from raw scores
2. Verify vector mathematics
3. Check framework-specific rules
4. Validate transformation consistency

### Layer 5: LLM Second Opinion Cross-Validation
**Purpose**: Independent verification of analysis quality

**Process**:
1. **Trigger Conditions**:
   - Statistical anomalies detected
   - High default value ratio
   - Low confidence scores
   - Mathematical artifacts present

2. **Second Opinion Analysis**:
   - Independent LLM analysis of same text
   - Cross-validation of well scores
   - Comparison of explanation quality
   - Consensus building between analyses

3. **Consensus Metrics**:
   - Score correlation between analyses
   - Explanation similarity
   - Well-by-well agreement rates
   - Overall narrative interpretation alignment

### Layer 6: Anomaly Detection
**Purpose**: Systematic identification of suspicious patterns

**Detection Algorithms**:
- **Uniform Distribution Detection**: Scores clustered around single value
- **Perfect Symmetry Detection**: Mathematical cancellation patterns
- **Outlier Analysis**: Extreme scores or positions
- **Temporal Consistency**: Analysis stability across re-runs

## Quality Confidence Scoring

### Confidence Levels

**HIGH Confidence** (>0.8):
- All wells successfully parsed
- Low default value ratio (<20%)
- Good score variance (>0.1)
- Mathematical consistency verified
- No anomalies detected

**MEDIUM Confidence** (0.5-0.8):
- Most wells parsed successfully
- Moderate default values (20-40%)
- Some statistical concerns
- Minor mathematical inconsistencies
- Possible anomalies detected

**LOW Confidence** (<0.5):
- High parsing failure rate
- Excessive default values (>50%)
- Statistical anomalies present
- Mathematical artifacts detected
- Requires second opinion validation

### Quality Metrics Dashboard

**Parsing Success Rate**:
- Wells successfully parsed / Total wells
- Trend analysis over time
- Framework-specific success rates

**Statistical Health**:
- Average score variance across analyses
- Default value ratio trends
- Anomaly detection frequency

**Mathematical Accuracy**:
- Coordinate calculation verification rate
- Vector sum consistency
- Transformation accuracy
