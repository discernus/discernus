Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, 
Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, my distinguished guests, my fellow 
Americans, this is America's day. This is democracy's day, a day of history and 
hope, of renewal and resolve. Through a crucible for the ages, America has

troops. Thank you, America.
