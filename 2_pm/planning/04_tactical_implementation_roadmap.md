# 04: Tactical Implementation Roadmap

**Status:** Updated Operational Plan v2.0  
**Date:** January 25, 2025  
**Strategic Alignment:** This roadmap executes the validation gates from `01_validation_plan.md` with universal template approach, implementing GPL â†’ Pillar 3 conversion strategy.  
**Dependencies:** `discernus_comprehensive_strategy.md`, `01_validation_plan.md`, BYU Partnership Requirements

## ðŸ”„ **Key Strategic Updates (January 2025)**

**Architecture Change:** Moved from complex automated notebook generation to clean universal templates
**Rationale:** 
- **Academic Trust:** Transparent, executable code researchers can understand and modify
- **Maintainability:** Single template instead of complex generation system  
- **Standard Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas - no custom abstractions
- **GPL Simplification:** Remove enterprise features to enable "Free Will Trap" conversion strategy

## Core Principle: Gate-Driven Development with Time-Bound Milestones

This tactical roadmap translates our **five validation gates** into specific, time-bound deliverables with clear success criteria and resource allocation. Each phase builds incrementally toward the next validation gate while maintaining academic rigor and partnership commitments.

**Implementation Philosophy:**
- **Validation-First**: No major investment without proven gate passage
- **Academic Partnership**: BYU collaboration as primary validation vector
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement based on gate feedback
- **Resource Protection**: Clear exit criteria prevent sunk cost fallacy
