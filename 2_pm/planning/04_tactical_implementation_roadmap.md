# 04: Tactical Implementation Roadmap

**Status:** Current Operational Plan  
**Strategic Alignment:** This roadmap executes the validation gates from `01_validation_plan.md` with specific milestones, bridging strategic intent with tactical execution.  
**Dependencies:** `discernus_comprehensive_strategy.md`, `01_validation_plan.md`, BYU Partnership Requirements

## Core Principle: Gate-Driven Development with Time-Bound Milestones

This tactical roadmap translates our **five validation gates** into specific, time-bound deliverables with clear success criteria and resource allocation. Each phase builds incrementally toward the next validation gate while maintaining academic rigor and partnership commitments.

**Implementation Philosophy:**
- **Validation-First**: No major investment without proven gate passage
- **Academic Partnership**: BYU collaboration as primary validation vector
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement based on gate feedback
- **Resource Protection**: Clear exit criteria prevent sunk cost fallacy
