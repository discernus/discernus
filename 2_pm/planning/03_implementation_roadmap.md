# 03: Implementation Roadmap

**Status:** Current Plan  
**Strategic Alignment:** This document provides the high-level sequence of milestones for executing our strategy. It is aligned with the `Phased Rollout Strategy` and focuses on achieving the five critical validation gates.

## Phase 1: Foundation Validation (Gates 1-2)
**Goal:** Prove the fundamental viability of the LLM+DCS approach for academic research.

*   **Milestone 1.1: Framework Enhancement**
    *   **Action:** Develop an enhanced, v3.2-compliant `populism_pluralism` framework based on the Tamaki & Fuks study.
    *   **Deliverable:** `populism_pluralism_v3.2.yaml`.
*   **Milestone 1.2: Replication Study**
    *   **Action:** Execute a four-condition experiment to replicate the original study's findings using the new framework.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Achieve >0.70 correlation with manual coding (Gate 1).
*   **Milestone 1.3: Extension Study**
    *   **Action:** Use the enhanced framework to quantify the populism vs. pluralism discourse competition in the target corpus.
    *   **Success Criteria:** Generate novel insights not present in the original study (Gate 2).
*   **Milestone 1.4: BYU Phase 1 Deliverable**
    *   **Action:** Package the findings from the replication and extension studies into a Jupyter notebook.
    *   **Deliverable:** `bolsonaro_methodological_validation.ipynb` for review by our academic partner.

## Phase 2: Integration & Usability (Gates 3-4)
**Goal:** Ensure the tooling is not just powerful, but also natural and intuitive for researchers to use within their existing workflows.

*   **Milestone 2.1: Results Analysis Interface**
    *   **Action:** Develop and refine the `jupyter_native_dcs.py` module for seamless results analysis.
    *   **Success Criteria:** A graduate student can become productive with the interface in under 2 hours (Gate 3).
*   **Milestone 2.2: End-to-End Workflow**
    *   **Action:** Create documentation and example notebooks demonstrating the full workflow from framework editing to final visualization within a Jupyter environment.
    *   **Success Criteria:** The entire research lifecycle can be managed within a Jupyter-native context (Gate 4).
*   **Milestone 2.3: BYU Phase 2 Deliverable**
    *   **Action:** Deliver an interactive analysis tools package to the BYU team.
    *   **Deliverable:** An enhanced notebook with interactive widgets and tools for deeper data exploration.

## Phase 3: Partnership & Packaging (Gate 5)
**Goal:** Solidify the value proposition and deliver a package compelling enough to secure a long-term strategic academic partnership.

*   **Milestone 3.1: Academic Deliverable Creation**
    *   **Action:** Generate publication-ready outputs, including methodology documentation, visualizations, and data exports.
*   **Milestone 3.2: Partnership Proposal Package**
    *   **Action:** Assemble a complete package including the validated tools, results, and a framework for future multi-university collaborations and grant applications.
    *   **Success Criteria:** The academic partner agrees to a long-term collaboration, confirming the success of Gate 5.

## Phase 4: Community Foundation (Post-Validation)
**Goal:** Transition from a single-partner validation project to the public launch of the Pillar 2 `discernus-community` package.

*   **Milestone 4.1: Public Package Release**
    *   **Action:** Clean up, document, and publish the first version of the `discernus-community` Python package to PyPI.
*   **Milestone 4.2: Tutorial & Documentation Site**
    *   **Action:** Create a public-facing website with a "Getting Started" guide, tutorials, and comprehensive documentation.
*   **Milestone 4.3: Launch Freemium Micro-services**
    *   **Action:** Deploy the initial cloud-connected services (e.g., Framework Validation) that provide value to free users and telemetry to the company.
