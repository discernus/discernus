experiment:
  name: "IDITI_Framework_Validation_Study"
  hypothesis: "Three-part validation of the IDITI framework: (1) Discriminative validity - framework can distinguish dignity from tribalism rhetoric with clear scoring separation, (2) Ideological agnosticism - framework scores based on dignity/tribalism content rather than conservative/progressive orientation, (3) Ground truth alignment - pre-labeled validation texts match expected framework well responses."

assumptions_and_reasoning:
  component_selection_rationale:
    llm_analysis_approach: "Traditional analysis selected over hierarchical analysis because IDITI framework contains only one dipole (Dignity vs Tribalism), eliminating the need for hierarchical ranking across multiple dimensions"
    mathematical_weighting: "Linear traditional weighting selected over hierarchical weighting because with only one dipole, there are no primary/secondary/tertiary tiers to weight differently - equal treatment of both wells is appropriate"
    model_selection: "Single model (gpt-4o) selected for baseline validation to establish framework performance before expanding to multi-model comparison studies"
  
  validation_criteria:
    hypothesis_1_discriminative_validity:
      dignity_texts: "Texts with 'dignity' in filename or folder path should score > 0.6 on Dignity well and < 0.4 on Tribalism well"
      tribalism_texts: "Texts with 'tribalism' in filename or folder path should score > 0.6 on Tribalism well and < 0.4 on Dignity well"
      mixed_texts: "Texts labeled as 'balanced' or 'mixed' should score in 0.4-0.6 range on both wells, demonstrating framework's ability to detect balanced rhetoric"
      statistical_significance: "Group differences between dignity and tribalism categories should achieve p < 0.05 for discriminative validity"
    
    hypothesis_2_ideological_agnosticism:
      conservative_vs_progressive_dignity: "Conservative dignity texts should score similarly to progressive dignity texts on Dignity well (no significant difference, p > 0.05)"
      conservative_vs_progressive_tribalism: "Conservative tribalism texts should score similarly to progressive tribalism texts on Tribalism well (no significant difference, p > 0.05)"
      cross_ideological_consistency: "Framework should show consistent scoring patterns regardless of conservative/progressive orientation"
    
    hypothesis_3_ground_truth_alignment:
      corpus_validation: "Pre-labeled texts in validation corpus should align with expected framework responses, validating our manual categorization"
      extreme_controls_performance: "Extreme control texts (pure examples) should show strongest alignment with expected wells"
      mixed_controls_performance: "Mixed control texts should demonstrate framework's ability to detect balanced rhetoric as designed"
  
  study_purpose:
    primary_goal: "Establish baseline performance metrics for IDITI framework using complete curated validation corpus (32 texts)"
    iterative_approach: "Results will inform corpus refinement and framework tuning in subsequent validation cycles"
    success_criteria: "Clear separation between categories in visualization, statistically significant group differences, ideological neutrality, and logical scoring patterns matching ground-truth labels"
