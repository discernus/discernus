Fukuyama Identity Framework Demonstration

This script demonstrates the Fukuyama Identity Framework with examples from the 
conversational model, showing how it analyzes democratic sustainability through
identity, recognition, and thymos dynamics.

Based on the theoretical development conversation that refined the framework
from 5 dipoles to 3 core dipoles focused on Fukuyama's central insights.
