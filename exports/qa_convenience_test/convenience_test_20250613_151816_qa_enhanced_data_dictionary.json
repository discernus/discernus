        "DONALD J. TRUMP Inaugural Address January 20, 2025 Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody.\n\n[Applause] Wow. Thank you very, very much. Vice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens: The golden age of America begins right now.\n\nFrom this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world.\n\nWe will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer. During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first. Our sovereignty will be reclaimed.\n\nOur safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our Government will end.\n\nAnd our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free.\n\nAmerica will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before. I return to the Presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.\n\nBut first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America.\n\nAs we gather today, our Government confronts a crisis of trust.\n\nFor many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair. We now have a Government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while, at the same time, stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad. It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens, but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.\n\nWe have a Government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people.\n\nOur country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina\u2014who have been treated so badly\u2014and other States who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago or, more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They're raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don't have a home any longer.\n\nBut we can't let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That's going to change.\n\nWe have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world. And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves, in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.\n\nMy recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed, their freedom. From this moment on, America's decline is over. Our liberties and our Nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied.\n\nAnd we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America's Government. Over the past 8 years, I have been tested and challenged more than any President in our 250-year history, and I've learned a lot along the way. The journey to reclaim our Republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you.\n\nThose who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life. Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear.\n\nBut I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. [Applause] Thank you.\n\nThank you. Thank you very much.\n\nThat is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength.\n\nWe will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.\n\nFor American citizens, January 20, 2025, is liberation day. It is my hope that our recent Presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country. As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural.\n\nAnd very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing States\u2014[applause]\u2014and the popular vote, we won by millions of people.\n\nTo the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records, and I will not forget it. I've heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.\n\nToday is Martin Luther King Day. And his honor\u2014this will be a great honor.\n\nBut in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality.\n\nWe will make his dream come true. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you.\n\nThank you. National unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before. In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success.\n\nWe will not forget our country, we will not forget our Constitution, and we will not forget our God. [Applause] Can't do that.\n\nToday I will sign a series of historic Executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense.\n\nFirst, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.\n\nWe will reinstate my \"Remain in Mexico\" policy.\n\nI will end the practice of catch-and-release. And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nAnd by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our Government to use the full and immense power of Federal and State law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities. As Commander in Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do.\n\nWe will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before. Next, I will direct all members of my Cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency.\n\nWe will drill, baby, drill.\n\nAmerica will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth, and we are going to use it. We'll use it.\n\nWe will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world.\n\nWe will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it. With my actions today, we will end the \"green new deal,\" and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. In other words, you'll be able to buy the car of your choice.\n\nWe will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the autoworkers of our Nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote.\n\nI will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\n\nFor this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources. The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.\n\nTo restore competence and effectiveness to our Federal Government, my administration will establish the brandnew Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nAfter years and years of illegal and unconstitutional Federal efforts to restrict free expression, I also will sign an Executive order to immediately stop all Government censorship and bring back free speech to America. Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents, something I know something about. [Laughter] We will not allow that to happen.\n\nIt will not happen again. Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.\n\nThis week, I will also end the Government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.\n\nWe will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based. As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States Government that there are only two genders: male and female. This week, I will reinstate any servicemembers who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full backpay.\n\nAnd I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty. It's going to end immediately. Our Armed Forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission: defeating America's enemies.\n\nLike in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen.\n\nWe will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end and, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into. My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That's what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier.\n\nI'm pleased to say that as of yesterday, 1 day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families. [Applause] Thank you.\n\nAmerica will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on Earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world. A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and we will restore the name of a great President, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent\u2014he was a natural businessman\u2014and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United States\u2014the United States\u2014I mean, think of this\u2014spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.\n\nWe have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panama's promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape, or form.\n\nAnd that includes the United States Navy. And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn't give it to China.\n\nWe gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back. Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history's greatest civilization. So, as we liberate our Nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success.\n\nWe will not be deterred. Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.\n\nThe United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons. And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars. Ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and, right now, our Nation is more ambitious than any other.\n\nThere's no nation like our Nation. Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts.\n\nThe call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls. Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth. No one comes close.\n\nAmericans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens, and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand. If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.\n\nMany people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback.\n\nBut as you see today, here I am. The American people have spoken. I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do.\n\nIn America, the impossible is what we do best. From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, DC, our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.\n\nTogether, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.\n\nAfter all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the 4 greatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore America promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love, and we love it so much.\n\nWe are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. So, to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. We're going to win like never before.\n\n[Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nThank you. In recent years, our Nation has suffered greatly.\n\nBut we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before.\n\nWe will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.\n\nAmerica will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and good will.\n\nWe will be prosperous, we will be proud, we will be strong, and we will win like never before.\n\nWe will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken, and we will not fail. From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign, and independent nation.\n\nWe will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans. The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun. Thank you.\n\nGod bless America. Thank you all. Thank you.\n\nThank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n\nThank you. Swearing-In Ceremony of Donald J. Trump, 47th President o\u2026 NOTE: The President spoke at 12:10 p.m.\n\nin the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. Prior to the address, Chief Justice of the United States John G.\n\nRoberts, Jr., administered the oath of office. Donald J.

        "JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. Address to a Joint Session of Congress March 1, 2022 Thank you.\n\nThank you. Thank you. Good to be back.\n\nAs Mitch and Chuck will understand, it's good to be almost home, down the hall. [Laughter] Anyway, thank you all. Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President\u2014no President has ever said those words from this podium.\n\nNo President has ever said those words, and it's about time. First Lady\u2014I'm her husband; Second Gentleman; Chief Justice; Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet; distinguished guests; my fellow Americans: While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is just a little bit different, a reminder of the extraordinary times we're in. Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this Chamber to speak to Congress, to the Nation, and to the world; to declare war, to celebrate peace; to announce new plans and possibilities.\n\nTonight I come to talk about crisis and opportunity, about rebuilding the Nation, revitalizing our democracy, and winning the future for America. I stand here tonight, 1 day shy of the hundredth day of my administration, hundred days since I took the oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a Nation\u2014we all did\u2014that was in crisis: the worst pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the Nation: America is on the move again, turning peril into possibility, crisis to opportunity, setbacks into strength.\n\nWe all know life can knock us down. But, in America, we never, ever, ever stay down. Americans always get up.\n\nToday, that's what we're doing: America is rising anew, choosing hope over fear, truth over lies, and light over darkness.\n\nAfter 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff, in my view. We're working again, dreaming again, discovering again, and leading the world again.\n\nWe have shown each other and the world that there's no quit in America\u2014none. One hundred days ago, America's house was on fire. And we had to act.\n\nAnd thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi; Majority Leader Schumer; and the overwhelming support of the American people\u2014 Democrats, Independents, and Republicans\u2014we did act. Together we passed the American Rescue Plan, one of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We're already seeing the results.\n\n[Applause ] We're already seeing the results.\n\nAfter I promised we'd get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into people's arms in 100 days, we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in those 100 days. Thanks to all the help of all of you, we're marshaling\u2014with your help, everyone's help\u2014we're marshaling every Federal resource. We've gotten vaccines to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers where the poorest of the poor can be reached.\n\nWe're setting up community vaccination sites, developing mobile units to get to hard-to-reach communities. Today, 90 percent of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16\u2014everyone\u2014is now eligible to get vaccinated right now, right away.\n\nGo get vaccinated, America. Go and get the vaccination. They're available.\n\nWhen I was sworn in on January 20, less than 1 percent of the seniors in America were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. One hundred days later, 70 percent of seniors in America over 65 are protected\u2014fully protected. Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80 percent since January\u2014down 80 percent\u2014because of all of you.\n\nAnd more than half of all the adults in America have gotten at least one shot. At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked the nurse\u2014I said, \"What's it like?\" She looked at me, and she said, \"It's like every shot is giving a dose of hope\"\u2014was her phrase. \"A dose of hope.\" A dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune disease\u2014wrote to me, said she's worried\u2014that she was worrying about bringing the virus home.\n\nShe said she then got vaccinated at a large site, in her car. She said she sat in her car, when she got vaccinated and just cried, cried out of joy and cried out of relief. Parents seeing the smiles on their kids' faces, for those who are able to go back to school because the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated.\n\nGrandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against a window to say goodbye. It means everything. Those things mean everything.\n\nYou know, there's still\u2014you all know it; you know it better than any group of Americans\u2014there's still more work to do to beat this virus. We can't let our guard down.\n\nBut tonight I can say it: Because of you, the American people, our progress these past hundred days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical achievements\u2014logistical achievements\u2014 this country has ever seen. What else have we done in those first hundred days? We kept our commitment\u2014Democrats and Republicans\u2014of sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households.\n\nWe've already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. It's making the difference. You all know it when you go home.\n\nFor many people, it's making all the difference in the world. The single mom in Texas who wrote to me, she said she couldn't work, but she said the relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment. A grandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor, something she said she put off for months because she didn't have the money.\n\nOne of the defining images, at least from my perspective, in this crisis has been cars lined up, cars lined up for miles. And not people who just barely ever start those cars, nice cars lined up for miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk. I don't know about you, but I didn't ever think I'd see that in America.\n\nAnd all of this is through no fault of their own. No fault of their own, these people are in this position. That's why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already.\n\nWe're also providing rental assistance\u2014you all know this, but the American people, I want to make sure they understand\u2014keeping people from being evicted from their homes, providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the job. During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act when I established the special signup period to do that \u2014800,000 in that period. We're making one of the largest one-time ever investments\u2014ever\u2014in improving health care for veterans.\n\nCritical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we're on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. And, in the process, while this was all going on, the economy created more than 1,300,000 new jobs in 100 days, more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 percent this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades.\n\nAmerica is moving\u2014moving forward\u2014but we can't stop now. We're in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century. We're at a great inflection point in history.\n\nWe have to do more than just build back better\u2014I mean, \"build back.\" We have to build back better.\n\nWe have to compete more strenuously than we have. Throughout our history, if you think about it, public investment in infrastructure has literally transformed America: our attitudes, as well as our opportunities. The transcontinental railroad, the interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United States of America.\n\nUniversal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon\u2014now we're on Mars\u2014discovering vaccines, gave us the internet, and so much more. These are the investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the Government was in a position to make.\n\nTime and again, they propel us into the future. That's why I proposed the American Jobs Plan, a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. This is the largest jobs plan since World War II.\n\nIt creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure; jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways; jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors, transit lines. It's clean water. And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water, a clear and present danger to our children's health.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the Nation's lead pipes and service lines so every American can drink clean water. And, in the process, it will create thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn't have it.\n\nThis is going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st-century economy. And I'm asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would\u2014\u2014 Vice President Kamala D. Harris .\n\nOf course. The President. \u2014\u2014because I know it will get done.\n\nIt creates jobs, building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, catastrophic failures, with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter storms. The American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid.\n\nWe can do that. Look, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careers. Two million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic\u20142 million, and too often because they couldn't get the care they needed to care for their child or care for an elderly parent who needs help.\n\nEight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. If you think it's not important, check out in your own district, Democrat or Republican. Democrat or Republican voters, their great concern\u2014almost as much as their children\u2014is taking care of an elderly loved one who can't be left alone.\n\nMedicaid contemplated it, but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits, continuing a cycle of growth.\n\nFor too long, we've failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis: \"jobs.\" Jobs. Jobs.\n\nFor me, when I think \"climate change,\" I think \"jobs.\" The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy-efficient buildings and homes; electrical workers\u2014 IBEW members\u2014installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways so we can own the electric car market. Farmers\u2014farmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it. Look, but think about it: There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can't be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing.\n\nNo reason. None. No reason.\n\nSo, folks, there's no reason why American workers can't lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. I mean, there is no reason.\n\nWe have the brightest, best trained people in the world. The American Jobs Plan is going to create millions of good-paying jobs\u2014jobs Americans can raise a family on\u2014as my dad would then say, \"with a little breathing room.\" And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: buy American. Buy American.\n\nAnd I might note, parenthetically, that does not violate any trade agreement. It's been the law since the thirties: buy American. American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America to create American jobs.\n\nThat's the way it's supposed to be and it will be in this administration. And I made it clear to all my Cabinet people. Their ability to give exemptions has been strenuously limited.\n\nIt will be American products.\n\nNow I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. So many of you\u2014so many of the folks I grew up with\u2014feel left behind, forgotten in an economy that's so rapidly changing it's frightening.\n\nI want to speak directly to you. Because if you think about it, that's what people are most worried about: \"Can I fit in?\" Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to economic growth in the years to come. It is an 8-year program.\n\nThese are good-paying jobs that can't be outsourced. Nearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree; 75 percent don't require an associate's degree. The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America.\n\nThat's what it is. And it recognizes something I've always said in this Chamber and the other. Good guys and women on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn't build this country.\n\nThe middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class. So that's why I'm calling on Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize Act\u2014the PRO Act\u2014and send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize. And by the way, while you're thinking about sending things to my desk\u2014 [laughter]\u2014let's raise the minimum wage to $15.\n\nNo one\u2014no one working 40 hours a week\u2014no one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line. We need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. And while we're doing this, let's get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as well\u2014 equal pay.\n\nIt's been much too long. And if you're wondering whether it's too long, look behind me. And finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and development on record.\n\nWe will see more technological change\u2014and some of you know more about this than I do\u2014 we'll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50. That's how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing. And we're falling behind the competition with the rest of the world.\n\nDecades ago, we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America\u20142 percent of our gross domestic product\u2014in research and development. Today, Mr. Secretary, that's less than 1 percent.\n\nChina and other countries are closing in fast.\n\nWe have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy. The Secretary of Defense can tell you\u2014and those of you on\u2014who work on national security issues know\u2014the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA\u2014the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency. The people who set up before I came here\u2014and that's been a long time ago\u2014to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security\u2014that's their only job.\n\nAnd it's a semiseparate agency; it's under the Defense Department. It's led to everything from the discovery of the internet to GPS and so much more that's enhanced our security. The National Institute of Health\u2014the NIH\u2014I believe, should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.\n\nAnd that would\u2014here's what it would do. It would have a singular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer. I'll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice President\u2014almost $9 million going to NIH.\n\nAnd if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I'll never forget you standing, Mitch, and saying you'd name it after my deceased son. It meant a lot.\n\nBut so many of us have deceased sons, daughters, and relatives who died of cancer. I can think of no more worthy investment. I know of nothing that is more bipartisan.\n\nSo let's end cancer as we know it. It's within our power. It's within our power to do it.\n\nInvestments in jobs and infrastructure, like the ones we're talking about, have often had bipartisan support in the past. Vice President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican Senators who just put forward their own proposal.\n\nSo let's get to work. I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the deep discussions. I'd like to meet with those who have ideas that are different\u2014they think are better.\n\nBut the rest of the world is not waiting for us. I just want to be clear: From my perspective, doing nothing is not an option. Look, we can't be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.\n\nSecretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi: traveled over 17,000 miles with him; spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him.\n\nWhen he called to congratulate me, we had a 2-hour discussion. He's deadly earnest about becoming the most significant, consequential nation in the world. He and others\u2014autocrats\u2014 think that democracy can't compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus.\n\nTo win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families and our children. That's why I've introduced the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America. First is access to a good education.\n\nWhen this Nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best educated, best prepared Nation in the world. It's, I believe, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21st\u2014in the 20th century.\n\nBut the world has caught up, or catching up. They are not waiting. I would say, parenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, \"Okay, we're going to decide what we do in terms of government providing for free education,\" I wonder whether we'd think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century.\n\nI doubt it. Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st century. That's why my American Families Plan guarantees 4 additional years of public education for every person in America, starting as early as we can.\n\nThe great universities of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years. It shows that adding 2 years of universal high-quality preschool for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old, no matter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years. It increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going on beyond graduation.\n\nThe research shows when a young child goes to school\u2014not daycare\u2014they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school.\n\nWhen you add 2 years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the dynamic. We can do that. And we'll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, Minority-Serving Institutions.\n\nThe reason is: They don't have the endowments, but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy\u2014 all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future. Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She's long said\u2014if I've heard it once, I've heard it a thousand times: \"Joe, any country that outeducates us is going to outcompete us.\" She'll be deeply involved in leading this effort.\n\nThank you, Jill. Second thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable childcare. We guarantee\u2014and I'm proposing a legislation to guarantee that low- and middle-income families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5.\n\nThe most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime. Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and medical leave\u2014family and medical leave. We're one of the few industrial countries in the world.\n\nNo one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones\u2014a parent, a spouse, or child. And fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans. In March, we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family.\n\nUp to $3,000 per child, if they're under 6 years of age\u2014I mean, excuse me\u2014under\u2014over [under]* 6 years of age, and $3,600 for children over 6 years of age. With two parents, two kids, that's $7,200 in the pockets that's going to help to take care of your family. And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child]* poverty in half.\n\nAnd we can afford it. So we did that in the last piece of legislation we passed.\n\nBut let's extend that childcare tax credit at least through the end of 2025. The American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I know that's really popular on this side of the aisle.\n\n[Laughter] But let's make that provision permanent so their premiums don't go back up. In addition to my Families Plan, I'm going to work with Congress to address, this year, other critical priorities for American families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women's health.\n\nAnd the pandemic has demonstrated how badly\u2014how badly\u2014it's needed. Let's lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care\u2014in the Affordable Care Act. And let's lower prescription drug costs.\n\nWe know how to do this. The last President had that as an objective. We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America.\n\nIn fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in America\u2014nearly three times\u2014for the same drug, nearly three times what other countries pay.\n\nWe have to change that, and we can. Let's do what we've always talked about for all the years I was down here in this body\u2014in Congress. Let's give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices.\n\nAnd by the way, it won't just help people on Medicare, it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone. And the money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny. It's within our power to do it; let's do it now.\n\nWe've talked about it long enough. Democrats and Republicans, let's get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right and not a privilege in America.\n\nSo how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan? I made it clear, we can do it without increasing the deficits. Let's start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000.\n\nIt's\u2014but it's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share. Just their fair share. Sometimes, I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party.\n\nI think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share. A recent study shows that 55 of the nation's biggest corporations paid zero Federal tax last year. Those 55 corporations made in excess of $40 billion in profit.\n\nA lot of companies also evade taxes through tax havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. It's not right.\n\nWe're going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from as well. And we're going to reward work, not just wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans\u2014those making over $400,000 or more\u2014back up to where it was when George W.\n\nBush was President when he started: 39.6 percent. That's where it was when George W. was President.\n\nWe're going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than a million dollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a paycheck. We're only going to affect three-tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by that action\u2014three-tenths of 1 percent. And the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes.\n\nIt's estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that are left, right, and center. I'm not looking to punish anybody.\n\nBut I will not add a tax burden\u2014 additional tax burden to the middle class in this country. They're already paying enough. I believe what I propose is fair, fiscally responsible, and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country.\n\nWhen you hear someone say that they don't want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or corporate America, ask them: \"Whose taxes you want to raise instead? Whose are you going to cut?\" Look, the big tax cut of 2017, remember, it was supposed to pay for itself\u2014 that was how it was sold\u2014and generate vast economic growth. Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit.\n\nIt was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top. Instead of using the tax saving to raise wages and invest in research and development, it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history.\n\nAccording to one study, CEOs make 320 times what the average worker in their corporation makes. It used to be in the\u2014below a hundred. The pandemic has only made things worse.\n\nTwenty million Americans lost their job in the pandemic: working and middle class Americans. At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion, in the same exact period.\n\nLet me say it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during this pandemic. And they're now worth more than $4 trillion. My fellow Americans, trickle-down\u2014trickle-down\u2014economics has never worked, and it's time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out.\n\nYou know, there's a broad consensus of economists\u2014left, right, center \u2014and they agree what I'm proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest value investments we can make as a Nation. I've often said: Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our power.\n\nIn my conversations with world leaders\u2014and I've spoken to over 38, 40 of them now\u2014I've made it known\u2014I've made it known\u2014that America is back. And you know what they say? The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say: \"We see America is back, but for how long?\n\nBut for how long?\" My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we're back, but that we're back to stay and that we aren't going to go it alone. We're going to do it by leading with our allies. No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time\u2014from terrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well as experiencing\u2014what we're experiencing now with pandemics.\n\nThere's no wall high enough to keep any virus out. And our own vaccine supply, as it grows to meet our needs\u2014and we're meeting them\u2014will become an arsenal for vaccines for other countries, just as America was the arsenal of democracy for the world and, in consequence, influenced the world.\n\nBut every American will have access before that occurs\u2014every American will have access to be fully covered by COVID-19 from the vaccines we have. Look, the climate crisis is not our fight alone, it's a global fight.\n\nThe United States accounts, as all of you know, less than 15 percent of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85 percent. That's why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris accord\u2014because if we do everything perfectly, it's not going to ultimately matter.\n\nI kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the major economies of the world\u2014China, Russia, India, the European Union\u2014and I said I'd do it in my first hundred days.\n\nI want to be very blunt about it: I had\u2014my attempt was to make sure that the world could see there was a consensus, that we are at an inflection point in history. And consensus\u2014the consensus is: If we act to save the planet, we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the world. If you've watched any of it\u2014and you were all busy; I'm sure you didn't have much time\u2014that's what virtually every nation said, even the ones that aren't doing their fair share.\n\nThe investments I've proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy, in my view, that benefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China. My discussions\u2014in my discussions with President Xi, I told him, \"We welcome the competition.\n\nWe're not looking for conflict.\" But I made absolutely clear that we will defend America's interests across the board.\n\nAmerica will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies from state\u2014to state-owned operations and enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property. I also told President Xi that we'll maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific, just as we do with NATO in Europe, not to start a conflict, but to prevent one. I told him what I've said to many world leaders: that America will not back away from our commitments\u2014our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms and to our alliances.\n\nAnd I pointed out to him: No responsible American President could remain silent when basic human rights are being so blatantly violated. An American President has to represent the essence of what our country stands for.\n\nAmerica is an idea, the most unique idea in history: We are created, all of us, equal. It's who we are, and we cannot walk away from that principle and, in fact, say we're dealing with the American idea. With regard to Russia, I know it concerns some of you, but I made very clear to Putin that we're not going to seek\u2014excuse me\u2014escalation, but their actions will have consequence if they turn out to be true.\n\nAnd they turned out to be true, so I responded directly and proportionally to Russia's interference in our elections and the cyber attacks on our Government and our business. They did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have.\n\nBut we can also cooperate when it's in our mutual interest. We did it when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms, and we're working to do it on climate change.\n\nBut he understands we will respond. On Iran and North Korea\u2014nuclear programs that present serious threats to American security and the security of the world\u2014we're going to be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy, as well as stern deterrence. And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan.\n\nWe have, without hyperbole, the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. I'm the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a war zone. Today, we have servicemembers serving in the same war zone as their parents did.\n\nWe have servicemembers in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11. The war in Afghanistan, as we remember the debates here, were never meant to be multigenerational undertakings of nation-building. We went to Afghanistan to get terrorists\u2014the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11\u2014and we said we would follow Usama bin Laden to the gates of hell to do it.\n\nIf you've been to the upper Kunar Valley, you've kind of seen the gates of hell. And we delivered justice to bin Laden. We degraded the terrorist threat of Al Qaida in Afghanistan.\n\nAnd after 20 years of value\u2014valor and sacrifice, it's time to bring those troops home. Look, even as we do, we will maintain an over-the-horizon capacity to suppress future threats to the homeland. And make no mistake: In 20 years, terrorists has\u2014terrorism has metastasized.\n\nThe threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan. And those of you in the intelligence committees, the foreign relations committee, the defense committees, you know well: We have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from. Al Qaida and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, other places in Africa, the Middle East, and beyond.\n\nAnd we won't ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today: White supremacy is terrorism. We're not going to ignore that either. My fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this Nation.\n\nIt was nearly a year ago, before her father's funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd's young daughter. She's a little tyke, so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the eye. And she looked at me and she said, \"My daddy changed the world.\" Well, after the conviction of George Floyd's murderer, we can see how right she was if we have the courage to act as a Congress.\n\nWe've all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans.\n\nNow is our opportunity to make some real progress. The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our communities, and they serve them honorably. I know them.\n\nI know they want to help meet this moment as well. My fellow Americans, we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system, and to enact police reform in George Floyd's name that passed the House already. I know Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in the very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate.\n\nWe need to work together to find a consensus.\n\nBut let's get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd's death. The country supports this reform, and Congress should act\u2014should act.\n\nWe have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe towards justice\u2014real justice. And with the plans outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America and American lives in other ways; a chance to deliver real equity\u2014good jobs, good schools, affordable housing, clean air, clean water, being able to generate wealth and pass it down two generations because you have an access to purchase a house. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans: Black, White, Latino, Asian Americans, Native Americans.\n\nLook, I also want to thank the United States Senate for voting 94 to 1 to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. You acted decisively. And you can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes we've seen over the past year\u2014this past year and for too long.\n\nI urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk, which I will gladly, anxiously sign. I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans.\n\nTo all transgender Americans watching at home, especially young people who are so brave, I want you to know your President has your back. Another thing: Let's authorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law for 27 years. Twenty-seven years ago, I wrote it.\n\nIt will close the\u2014 the act that has to be authorized now will close the \"boyfriend\" loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. The court order said: \"This is an abuser. You can't own a gun.\" It's to close that loophole that existed.\n\nYou know, it's estimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America\u201450 a month. Let's pass it and save some lives. And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America.\n\nThe flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. And, in the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America\u2014250 shot dead. I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue.\n\nIn the nineties, we passed universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high- capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined.\n\nCheck out the report over 10 years.\n\nBut in the early twenty\u20142000s, the law expired, and we've seen daily bloodshed since. I'm not saying if the law continued, we wouldn't see bloodshed. More than 2 weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know\u2014the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence\u2014I laid out several of the Department of Justice actions that are being taken to impact on this epidemic.\n\nOne of them is banning so-called \"ghost guns.\" These are homemade guns built from a kit that includes directions on how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers, so they show up at crime scenes, and they can't be traced. The buyers of these ghost gun kits aren't required to pass any background check.\n\nAnyone, from a criminal or terrorist, could buy this kit and, within 30 minutes, have a weapon that's lethal.\n\nBut no more. And I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence, but it's time for Congress to act as well. Look, I don't want to become confrontational, but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democratic colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns.\n\nWe need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And don't tell me it can't be done. We did it before, and it worked.\n\nTalk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They'll tell you there's no possible justification for having 100 rounds in a weapon. What do you think: deer are wearing Kevlar vests?\n\n[Laughter] No, what's\u2014they'll tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun, but shouldn't be able to buy a gun. These kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, including many gun owners. The country supports reform and is\u2014and Congress should act.\n\nThis shouldn't be a red or blue issue. And no amendment to the Constitution is absolute. You can't yell \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater.\n\nFrom the very beginning, there were certain guns, weapons, that could not be owned by Americans. Certain people could not own those weapons ever. We're not changing the Constitution; we're being reasonable.\n\nI think this is not a Democrat or Republican issue, I think it's an American issue. And here's what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to America. Let's end our exhausting war over immigration.\n\nFor more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we've done nothing about it. It's time to fix it. On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress.\n\nIf you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it so over 11 million undocumented folks\u2014the vast majority are here overstaying visas. Pass it.\n\nWe can actually\u2014if you actually want to solve a problem, I've sent a bill to\u2014so take a close look at it.\n\nWe have to\u2014also have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing, particularly to\u2014to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador: the violence, the corruption, the gangs, and the political instability, hunger, hurricanes, earthquakes, natural disasters.\n\nWhen I was President, my President\u2014when I was Vice President, the President asked me to focus on providing the help needed to address the root causes of migration. And it helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. The plan was working, but the last administration decided it was not worth it.\n\nI'm restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this.\n\nI have absolute confidence she'll get the job done. Now, look, if you don't like my plan, let's at least pass what we all agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for \"dreamers,\" the young people who have only known America as their home.\n\nAnd permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status who came from countries beset by manmade and natural- made\u2014violence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables. Look, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history.\n\nThe country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let's argue over it, let's debate it, but let's act.\n\nAnd if we truly want to restore the soul of America, we need to protect the sacred right to vote. Most people\u2014more people voted in the last Presidential election than any time in American history, in the middle of the worst pandemic ever. It should be celebrated.\n\nInstead, it's being attacked. Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my desk right away.\n\nThe country supports it. The Congress should act now. Look, in closing, as we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol, desecrating our democracy, remain vivid in all our minds.\n\nLives were put at risk\u2014many of your lives. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned.\n\nThe insurrection was an existential crisis, a test of whether our democracy could survive. And it did.\n\nBut the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent, as old as our Republic, still vital today. Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us, created equal in the image of God, have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility?\n\nCan our democracy deliver the most\u2014to the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate, and fears that have pulled us apart? America's adversaries\u2014the autocrats of the world\u2014are betting we can't.\n\nAnd I promise you, they're betting we can't. They believe we're too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy.\n\nBut they are wrong. You know it; I know it.\n\nBut we have to prove them wrong.\n\nWe have to prove democracy still works, that our Government still works and we can deliver for our people. In our first hundred days together, we've acted to restore the people's faith in democracy to deliver. We're vaccinating the Nation.\n\nWe're creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs. We're delivering real results to people; they can see it and feel it in their own lives. Opening doors of opportunity, guaranteeing some more fairness and justice, that's the essence of America.\n\nThat's democracy in action. Our Constitution opens with the words\u2014as trite as it sounds\u2014\"We the People\". Well, it's time to remember that \"We the People\" are the Government\u2014you and I.\n\nNot some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force that we have no control over. It's us.\n\nIt's \"We the People.\" In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us, \"In America, we do our part.\" We all do our part. That's all I'm asking: that we do our part, all of us. If we do that, we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong.\n\nAutocrats will not win the future. We will.\n\nAmerica will. And the future belongs to America. As I stand here tonight before you, in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our Nation, and I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or optimistic about America, not because I'm President, because what's happening with the American people.\n\nWe have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy, pandemic and pain, and \"We the People\" did not flinch. At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail, we came together. We united.\n\nWith light and hope, we summoned a new strength, new resolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century, on our way to a union more perfect, more prosperous, and more just, as one people, one Nation, and one America. Folks, as I told every world leader I've ever met with over the years, it's never ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America, and it still isn't.\n\nWe are the United States of America. There is not a single thing\u2014nothing\u2014 nothing beyond our capacity. We can do whatever we set our mind to do if we do it together.\n\nSo let's begin to get together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience.\n\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:06 p.m. in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn his remarks, he referred to Senate Minority Leader A.

        "WILLIAM J. CLINTON Address to a Joint Session of Congress January 24, 1995 Mr. Speaker, Mr.\n\nVice President, Members of the 105th Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans: Since the last time we met in this Chamber, America has lost two patriots and fine public servants. Though they sat on opposite sides of the aisle, Representatives Walter Capps and Sonny Bono shared a deep love for this House and an unshakable commitment to improving the lives of all our people. In the past few weeks, they've both been eulogized.\n\nTonight I think we should begin by sending a message to their families and their friends that we celebrate their lives and give thanks for their service to our Nation.\n\nFor 209 years, it has been the President's duty to report to you on the state of the Union. Because of the hard work and high purpose of the American people, these are good times for America.\n\nWe have more than 14 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 24 years, the lowest core inflation in 30 years; incomes are rising; and we have the highest homeownership in history. Crime has dropped for a record 5 years in a row, and the welfare rolls are at their lowest levels in 27 years. Our leadership in the world is unrivaled.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the state of our Union is strong.\n\nBut with barely 700 days left in the 20th century, this is not a time to rest. It is a time to build, to build the America within reach, an America where everybody has a chance to get ahead with hard work; where every citizen can live in a safe community; where families are strong, schools are good, and all our young people can go on to college; an America where scientists find cures for diseases from diabetes to Alzheimer's to AIDS; an America where every child can stretch a hand across a keyboard and reach every book ever written, every painting ever painted, every symphony ever composed; where government provides opportunity and citizens honor the responsibility to give something back to their communities; an America which leads the world to new heights of peace and prosperity. This is the America we have begun to build; this is the America we can leave to our children if we join together to finish the work at hand.\n\nLet us strengthen our Nation for the 21st century. Rarely have Americans lived through so much change in so many ways in so short a time. Quietly, but with gathering force, the ground has shifted beneath our feet as we have moved into an information age, a global economy, a truly new world.\n\nFor 5 years now, we have met the challenge of these changes, as Americans have at every turning point in our history, by renewing the very idea of America: widening the circle of opportunity, deepening the meaning of our freedom, forging a more perfect Union. We shaped a new kind of Government for the information age. I thank the Vice President for his leadership and the Congress for its support in building a Government that is leaner, more flexible, a catalyst for new ideas, and most of all, a Government that gives the American people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives.\n\nWe have moved past the sterile debate between those who say government is the enemy and those who say government is the answer. My fellow Americans, we have found a third way.\n\nWe have the smallest Government in 35 years, but a more progressive one.\n\nWe have a smaller Government, but a stronger Nation.\n\nWe are moving steadily toward an even stronger America in the 21st century: an economy that offers opportunity, a society rooted in responsibility, and a nation that lives as a community. First, Americans in this Chamber and across our Nation have pursued a new strategy for prosperity: fiscal discipline to cut interest rates and spur growth; investments in education and skills, in science and technology and transportation, to prepare our people for the new economy; new markets for American products and American workers.\n\nWhen I took office, the deficit for 1998 was projected to be $357 billion and heading higher. This year, our deficit is projected to be $10 billion and heading lower.\n\nFor three decades, six Presidents have come before you to warn of the damage deficits pose to our Nation.\n\nTonight I come before you to announce that the Federal deficit, once so incomprehensibly large that it had 11 zeros, will be, simply, zero.\n\nI will submit to Congress for 1999 the first balanced budget in 30 years. And if we hold fast to fiscal discipline, we may balance the budget this year\u20144 years ahead of schedule. You can all be proud of that, because turning a sea of red ink into black is no miracle.\n\nIt is the product of hard work by the American people and of two visionary actions in Congress: the courageous vote in 1993 that led to a cut in the deficit of 90 percent, and the truly historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement passed by this Congress. Here's the really good news: If we maintain our resolve, we will produce balanced budgets as far as the eye can see.\n\nWe must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk reopening the deficit. Last year, together, we enacted targeted tax cuts so that the typical middle class family will now have the lowest tax rates in 20 years. My plan to balance the budget next year includes both new investments and new tax cuts targeted to the needs of working families, for education, for child care, for the environment.\n\nBut whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of you to meet this test: Approve only those priorities that can actually be accomplished without adding a dime to the deficit. Now, if we balance the budget for next year, it is projected that we'll then have a sizable surplus in the years that immediately follow. What should we do with this projected surplus?\n\nI have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first.\n\nTonight I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus\u2014that's every penny of any surplus\u2014until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century. Let us say to all Americans watching tonight\u2014whether you're 70 or 50 or whether you just started paying into the system\u2014Social Security will be there when you need it. Let us make this commitment: Social Security first.\n\nLet's do that together. I also want to say that all the American people who are watching us tonight should be invited to join in this discussion, in facing these issues squarely and forming a true consensus on how we should proceed. We'll start by conducting nonpartisan forums in every region of the country, and I hope that lawmakers of both parties will participate.\n\nWe'll hold a White House conference on Social Security in December. And one year from now, I will convene the leaders of Congress to craft historic, bipartisan legislation to achieve a landmark for our generation: a Social Security system that is strong in the 21st century. In an economy that honors opportunity, all Americans must be able to reap the rewards of prosperity.\n\nBecause these times are good, we can afford to take one simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling to provide for their families: We should raise the minimum wage. The information age is, first and foremost, an education age, in which education must start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime. Last year, from this podium, I said that education has to be our highest priority.\n\nI laid out a 10point plan to move us forward and urged all of us to let politics stop at the schoolhouse door.\n\nSince then, this Congress\u2014across party lines\u2014 and the American people have responded, in the most important year for education in a generation, expanding public school choice, opening the way to 3,000 new charter schools, working to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway, committing to expand Head Start to a million children, launching America Reads, sending literally thousands of college students into our elementary schools to make sure all our 8-year- olds can read. Last year I proposed and you passed 220,000 new Pell grant scholarships for deserving students. Student loans, already less expensive and easier to repay\u2014now you get to deduct the interest.\n\nFamilies all over America now can put their savings into new tax-free education IRA's. And this year, for the first 2 years of college, families will get a $1,500 tax credit\u2014a HOPE scholarship that will cover the cost of most community college tuition. And for junior and senior year, graduate school, and job training, there is a lifetime learning credit.\n\nYou did that, and you should be very proud of it. And because of these actions, I have something to say to every family listening to us tonight: Your children can go on to college. If you know a child from a poor family, tell her not to give up; she can go on to college.\n\nIf you know a young couple struggling with bills, worried they won't be able to send their children to college, tell them not to give up; their children can go on to college. If you know somebody who's caught in a dead-end job and afraid he can't afford the classes necessary to get better jobs for the rest of his life, tell him not to give up; he can go on to college. Because of the things that have been done, we can make college as universal in the 21st century as high school is today.\n\nAnd my friends, that will change the face and future of America.\n\nWe have opened wide the doors of the world's best system of higher education.\n\nNow we must make our public elementary and secondary schools the world's best, as well, by raising standards, raising expectations, and raising accountability. Thanks to the actions of this Congress last year, we will soon have, for the very first time, a voluntary national test based on national standards in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math. Parents have a right to know whether their children are mastering the basics.\n\nAnd every parent already knows the key: good teachers and small classes.\n\nTonight I propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grades. My balanced budget will help to hire 100,000 new teachers who've passed a State competency test. Now, with these teachers\u2014listen\u2014 with these teachers, we will actually be able to reduce class size in the first, second, and third grades to an average of 18 students a class, all across America.\n\nIf I've got the math right, more teachers teaching smaller classes requires more classrooms. So I also propose a school construction tax cut to help communities modernize or build 5,000 schools.\n\nWe must also demand greater accountability.\n\nWhen we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors. It is time to end social promotion in America's schools. Last year, in Chicago, they made that decision\u2014not to hold our children back but to lift them up.\n\nChicago stopped social promotion and started mandatory summer school to help students who are behind to catch up. I propose to help other communities follow Chicago's lead. Let's say to them: Stop promoting children who don't learn, and we will give you the tools to make sure they do.\n\nI also ask this Congress to support our efforts to enlist colleges and universities to reach out to disadvantaged children, starting in the sixth grade, so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know that they, too, will be able to go on to college.\n\nAs we enter the 21st century, the global economy requires us to seek opportunity not just at home but in all the markets of the world.\n\nWe must shape this global economy, not shrink from it. In the last 5 years, we have led the way in opening new markets, with 240 trade agreements that remove foreign barriers to products bearing the proud stamp \"Made in the USA.\" Today, record high exports account for fully one-third of our economic growth.\n\nI want to keep them going, because that's the way to keep America growing and to advance a safer, more stable world. All of you know, whatever your views are, that I think this is a great opportunity for America. I know there is opposition to more comprehensive trade agreements.\n\nI have listened carefully, and I believe that the opposition is rooted in two fears: first, that our trading partners will have lower environmental and labor standards which will give them an unfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favors, even if there's more business; and, second, that if we have more trade, more of our workers will lose their jobs and have to start over. I think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standards around the world.\n\nI have made it abundantly clear that it should be a part of our trade agenda.\n\nBut we cannot influence other countries' decisions if we send them a message that we're backing away from trade with them. This year I will send legislation to Congress, and ask other nations to join us, to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all: abusive child labor. We should also offer help and hope to those Americans temporarily left behind by the global marketplace or by the march of technology, which may have nothing to do with trade.\n\nThat's why we have more than doubled funding for training dislocated workers since 1993. And if my new budget is adopted, we will triple funding. That's why we must do more, and more quickly, to help workers who lose their jobs for whatever reason.\n\nYou know, we help communities in a special way when their military base closes; we ought to help them in the same way if their factory closes. Again, I ask the Congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of training programs we have today into one single \"GI bill\" for workers, a simple skills grant so people can, on their own, move quickly to new jobs, to higher incomes, and brighter futures. We all know, in every way in life, change is not always easy, but we have to decide whether we're going to try to hold it back and hide from it or reap its benefits.\n\nAnd remember the big picture here: While we've been entering into hundreds of new trade agreements, we've been creating millions of new jobs. So this year we will forge new partnerships with Latin America, Asia, and Europe. And we should pass the new \"African Trade Act\"; it has bipartisan support.\n\nI will also renew my request for the fast-track negotiating authority necessary to open more new markets, create more new jobs, which every President has had for two decades. You know, whether we like it or not, in ways that are mostly positive, the world's economies are more and more interconnected and interdependent. Today, an economic crisis anywhere can affect economies everywhere.\n\nRecent months have brought serious financial problems to Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, and beyond. Now, why should Americans be concerned about this? First, these countries are our customers.\n\nIf they sink into recession, they won't be able to buy the goods we'd like to sell them. Second, they're also our competitors. So if their currencies lose their value and go down, then the price of their goods will drop, flooding our market and others with much cheaper goods, which makes it a lot tougher for our people to compete.\n\nAnd finally, they are our strategic partners. Their stability bolsters our security. The American economy remains sound and strong, and I want to keep it that way.\n\nBut because the turmoil in Asia will have an impact on all the world's economies, including ours, making that negative impact as small as possible is the right thing to do for America and the right thing to do for a safer world. Our policy is clear: No nation can recover if it does not reform itself.\n\nBut when nations are willing to undertake serious economic reform, we should help them do it. So I call on Congress to renew America's commitment to the International Monetary Fund. And I think we should say to all the people we're trying to represent here that preparing for a far-off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder till the clouds are just overhead.\n\nA strong nation rests on the rock of responsibility. A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare. We can be proud that after decades of fingerpointing and failure, together we ended the old welfare system.\n\nAnd we're now replacing welfare checks with paychecks. Last year, after a record 4-year decline in welfare rolls, I challenged our Nation to move 2 million more Americans off welfare by the year 2000. I'm pleased to report we have also met that goal, 2 full years ahead of schedule.\n\nThis is a grand achievement, the sum of many acts of individual courage, persistence, and hope.\n\nFor 13 years, Elaine Kinslow of Indianapolis, Indiana, was on and off welfare. Today, she's a dispatcher with a van company. She's saved enough money to move her family into a good neighborhood, and she's helping other welfare recipients go to work.\n\nElaine Kinslow and all those like her are the real heroes of the welfare revolution. There are millions like her all across America. And I'm happy she could join the First Lady tonight.\n\nElaine, we're very proud of you. Please stand up. [Applause ] We still have a lot more to do, all of us, to make welfare reform a success\u2014 providing child care, helping families move closer to available jobs, challenging more companies to join our welfare-to-work partnership, increasing child support collections from deadbeat parents who have a duty to support their own children.\n\nI also want to thank Congress for restoring some of the benefits to immigrants who are here legally and working hard, and I hope you will finish that job this year.\n\nWe have to make it possible for all hardworking families to meet their most important responsibilities. Two years ago we helped guarantee that Americans can keep their health insurance when they change jobs. Last year we extended health care to up to 5 million children.\n\nThis year I challenge Congress to take the next historic steps. A hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizens are in managed care plans. These plans save money, and they can improve care.\n\nBut medical decisions ought to be made by medical doctors, not insurance company accountants. I urge this Congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a consumer bill of rights that says this: You have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest. You have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need.\n\nYou have the right to emergency room care, wherever and whenever you need it. You have the right to keep your medical records confidential. Traditional care or managed care, every American deserves quality care.\n\nMillions of Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have lost their health insurance. Some are retired; some are laid off; some lose their coverage when their spouses retire.\n\nAfter a lifetime of work, they are left with nowhere to turn. So I ask the Congress, let these hardworking Americans buy into the Medicare system. It won't add a dime to the deficit, but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless.\n\nNext, we must help parents protect their children from the gravest health threat that they face: an epidemic of teen smoking, spread by multimillion- dollar marketing campaigns. I challenge Congress: Let's pass bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that will improve public health, protect our tobacco farmers, and change the way tobacco companies do business forever. Let's do what it takes to bring teen smoking down.\n\nLet's raise the price of cigarettes by up to a dollar and a half a pack over the next 10 years, with penalties on the tobacco industry if it keeps marketing to our children. Tomorrow, like every day, 3,000 children will start smoking, and 1,000 will die early as a result. Let this Congress be remembered as the Congress that saved their lives.\n\nIn the new economy, most parents work harder than ever. They face a constant struggle to balance their obligations to be good workers and their even more important obligations to be good parents. The Family and Medical Leave Act was the very first bill I was privileged to sign into law as President in 1993.\n\nSince then, about 15 million people have taken advantage of it, and I've met a lot of them all across this country. I ask you to extend that law to cover 10 million more workers and to give parents time off when they have to go see their children's teachers or take them to the doctor. Child care is the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at home and at work.\n\nLast year I cohosted the very first White House Conference on Child Care with one of our foremost experts, America's First Lady. From all corners of America, we heard the same message, without regard to region or income or political affiliation: We've got to raise the quality of child care. We've got to make it safer.\n\nWe've got to make it more affordable. So here's my plan: Help families to pay for child care for a million more children; scholarships and background checks for child care workers, and a new emphasis on early learning; tax credits for businesses that provide child care for their employees; and a larger child care tax credit for working families. Now, if you pass my plan, what this means is that a family of four with an income of $35,000 and high child care costs will no longer pay a single penny of Federal income tax.\n\nI think this is such a big issue with me because of my own personal experience.\n\nI have often wondered how my mother, when she was a young widow, would have been able to go away to school and get an education and come back and support me if my grandparents hadn't been able to take care of me. She and I were really very lucky. How many other families have never had that same opportunity?\n\nThe truth is, we don't know the answer to that question.\n\nBut we do know what the answer should be: Not a single American family should ever have to choose between the job they need and the child they love. A society rooted in responsibility must provide safe streets, safe schools, and safe neighborhoods. We pursued a strategy of more police, tougher punishment, smarter prevention, with crimefighting partnerships with local law enforcement and citizen groups, where the rubber hits the road.\n\nI can report to you tonight that it's working. Violent crime is down; robbery is down; assault is down; burglary is down\u2014for 5 years in a row, all across America. We need to finish the job of putting 100,000 more police on our streets.\n\nAgain, I ask Congress to pass a juvenile crime bill that provides more prosecutors and probation officers, to crack down on gangs and guns and drugs, and bar violent juveniles from buying guns for life. And I ask you to dramatically expand our support for after-school programs. I think every American should know that most juvenile crime is committed between the hours of 3 in the afternoon and 8 at night.\n\nWe can keep so many of our children out of trouble in the first place if we give them someplace to go other than the streets, and we ought to do it. Drug use is on the decline. I thank General McCaffrey for his leadership, and I thank this Congress for passing the largest antidrug budget in history.\n\nNow I ask you to join me in a groundbreaking effort to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol agents and to deploy the most sophisticated available new technologies to help close the door on drugs at our borders. Police, prosecutors, and prevention programs, as good as they are, they can't work if our court system doesn't work. Today, there are large numbers of vacancies in our Federal courts.\n\nHere is what the Chief Justice of the United States wrote: \"Judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice.\" I simply ask the United States Senate to heed this plea and vote on the highly qualified judicial nominees before you, up or down.\n\nWe must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world. On the eve of a new century, we have the power and the duty to build a new era of peace and security.\n\nBut make no mistake about it; today's possibilities are not tomorrow's guarantees.\n\nAmerica must stand against the poisoned appeals of extreme nationalism.\n\nWe must combat an unholy axis of new threats from terrorists, international criminals, and drug traffickers. These 21st century predators feed on technology and the free flow of information and ideas and people. And they will be all the more lethal if weapons of mass destruction fall into their hands.\n\nTo meet these challenges, we are helping to write international rules of the road for the 21st century, protecting those who join the family of nations and isolating those who do not. Within days, I will ask the Senate for its advice and consent to make Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic the newest members of NATO.\n\nFor 50 years, NATO contained communism and kept America and Europe secure. Now, these three formerly Communist countries have said yes to democracy. I ask the Senate to say yes to them, our new allies.\n\nBy taking in new members and working closely with new partners, including Russia and Ukraine, NATO can help to assure that Europe is a stronghold for peace in the 21st century. Next, I will ask Congress to continue its support of our troops and their mission in Bosnia. This Christmas, Hillary and I traveled to Sarajevo with Senator and Mrs.\n\nDole and a bipartisan congressional delegation. We saw children playing in the streets, where 2 years ago they were hiding from snipers and shells. The shops are filled with food; the cafes were alive with conversation.\n\nThe progress there is unmistakable, but it is not yet irreversible.\n\nTo take firm root, Bosnia's fragile peace still needs the support of American and allied troops when the current NATO mission ends in June. I think Senator Dole actually said it best. He said, \"This is like being ahead in the fourth quarter of a football game.\n\nNow is not the time to walk off the field and forfeit the victory.\" I wish all of you could have seen our troops in Tuzla. They're very proud of what they're doing in Bosnia, and we're all very proud of them. One of those brave soldiers is sitting with the First Lady tonight: Army Sergeant Michael Tolbert.\n\nHis father was a decorated Vietnam vet.\n\nAfter college in Colorado, he joined the Army. Last year he led an infantry unit that stopped a mob of extremists from taking over a radio station that is a voice of democracy and tolerance in Bosnia. Thank you very much, Sergeant, for what you represent.\n\nPlease stand up. [Applause ] In Bosnia and around the world, our men and women in uniform always do their mission well. Our mission must be to keep them welltrained and ready, to improve their quality of life, and to provide the 21st century weapons they need to defeat any enemy.\n\nI ask Congress to join me in pursuing an ambitious agenda to reduce the serious threat of weapons of mass destruction. This year, four decades after it was first proposed by President Eisenhower, a comprehensive nuclear test ban is within reach. By ending nuclear testing, we can help to prevent the development of new and more dangerous weapons and make it more difficult for non-nuclear states to build them.\n\nI'm pleased to announce that four former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\u2014Generals John Shalikashvili, Colin Powell, and David Jones and Admiral William Crowe \u2014have endorsed this treaty. And I ask the Senate to approve it this year. Together, we must confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons and the outlaw states, terrorists, and organized criminals seeking to acquire them.\n\nSaddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade and much of his nation's wealth not on providing for the Iraqi people but on developing nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire Gulf war.\n\nNow Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, \"You cannot defy the will of the world,\" and when I say to him, \"You have used weapons of mass destruction before.\n\nWe are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.\" Last year the Senate ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention to protect our soldiers and citizens from poison gas.\n\nNow we must act to prevent the use of disease as a weapon of war and terror. The Biological Weapons Convention has been in effect for 23 years now. The rules are good, but the enforcement is weak.\n\nWe must strengthen it with a new international inspection system to detect and deter cheating. In the months ahead, I will pursue our security strategy with old allies in Asia and Europe and new partners from Africa to India and Pakistan, from South America to China. And from Belfast to Korea to the Middle East, America will continue to stand with those who stand for peace.\n\nFinally, it's long past time to make good on our debt to the United Nations. More and more, we are working with other nations to achieve common goals. If we want America to lead, we've got to set a good example.\n\nAs we see so clearly in Bosnia, allies who share our goals can also share our burdens. In this new era, our freedom and independence are actually enriched, not weakened, by our increasing interdependence with other nations.\n\nBut we have to do our part. Our Founders set America on a permanent course toward a more perfect Union.\n\nTo all of you I say, it is a journey we can only make together, living as one community. First, we have to continue to reform our Government, the instrument of our national community. Everyone knows elections have become too expensive, fueling a fundraising arms race.\n\nThis year, by March 6th, at long last the Senate will actually vote on bipartisan campaign finance reform proposed by Senators McCain and Feingold. Let's be clear: A vote against McCain-Feingold is a vote for soft money and for the status quo. I ask you to strengthen our democracy and pass campaign finance reform this year.\n\nAt least equally important, we have to address the real reason for the explosion in campaign costs: the high cost of media advertising. [At this point, audience members responded. ] The President.\n\nTo the folks watching at home, those were the groans of pain in the audience. [Laughter] I will formally request that the Federal Communications Commission act to provide free or reduced-cost television time for candidates who observe spending limits voluntarily. The airwaves are a public trust, and broadcasters also have to help us in this effort to strengthen our democracy.\n\nUnder the leadership of Vice President Gore, we've reduced the Federal payroll by 300,000 workers, cut 16,000 pages of regulation, eliminated hundreds of programs, and improved the operations of virtually every Government agency.\n\nBut we can do more. Like every taxpayer, I'm outraged by the reports of abuses by the IRS. We need some changes there: new citizen advocacy panels, a stronger taxpayer advocate, phone lines open 24 hours a day, relief for innocent taxpayers.\n\nLast year, by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, the House of Representatives passed sweeping IRS reforms. This bill must not now languish in the Senate.\n\nTonight I ask the Senate: Follow the House; pass the bipartisan package as your first order of business. I hope to goodness before I finish I can think of something to say \"follow the Senate\" on, so I'll be out of trouble. [Laughter] A nation that lives as a community must value all its communities.\n\nFor the past 5 years, we have worked to bring the spark of private enterprise to inner city and poor rural areas, with community development banks, more commercial loans in the poor neighborhoods, cleanup of polluted sites for development. Under the continued leadership of the Vice President, we propose to triple the number of empowerment zones to give business incentives to invest in those areas. We should also give poor families more help to move into homes of their own, and we should use tax cuts to spur the construction of more low-income housing.\n\nLast year, this Congress took strong action to help the District of Columbia. Let us renew our resolve to make our Capital City a great city for all who live and visit here. Our cities are the vibrant hubs of great metropolitan areas.\n\nThey are still the gateways for new immigrants from every continent, who come here to work for their own American dreams. Let's keep our cities going strong into the 21st century; they're a very important part of our future. Our communities are only as healthy as the air our children breathe, the water they drink, the Earth they will inherit.\n\nLast year we put in place the toughest-ever controls on smog and soot. We moved to protect Yellowstone, the Everglades, Lake Tahoe. We expanded every community's right to know about the toxins that threaten their children.\n\nJust yesterday, our food safety plan took effect, using new science to protect consumers from dangers like E. coli and salmonella.\n\nTonight I ask you to join me in launching a new clean water initiative, a far- reaching effort to clean our rivers, our lakes, and our coastal waters for our children. Our overriding environmental challenge tonight is the worldwide problem of climate change, global warming, the gathering crisis that requires worldwide action. The vast majority of scientists have concluded unequivocally that if we don't reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, at some point in the next century, we'll disrupt our climate and put our children and grandchildren at risk.\n\nThis past December, America led the world to reach a historic agreement committing our Nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market forces, new technologies, energy efficiency.\n\nWe have it in our power to act right here, right now. I propose $6 billion in tax cuts and research and development to encourage innovation, renewable energy, fuel-efficient cars, energy-efficient homes. Every time we have acted to heal our environment, pessimists have told us it would hurt the economy.\n\nWell, today, our economy is the strongest in a generation, and our environment is the cleanest in a generation.\n\nWe have always found a way to clean the environment and grow the economy at the same time. And when it comes to global warming, we'll do it again. Finally, community means living by the defining American value, the ideal heard 'round the world, that we are all created equal.\n\nThroughout our history, we haven't always honored that ideal and we've never fully lived up to it. Often it's easier to believe that our differences matter more than what we have in common. It may be easier, but it's wrong.\n\nWhat we have to do in our day and generation to make sure that America becomes truly one nation\u2014what do we have to do? We're becoming more and more and more diverse. Do you believe we can become one nation?\n\nThe answer cannot be to dwell on our differences but to build on our shared values. We all cherish family and faith, freedom and responsibility. We all want our children to grow up in a world where their talents are matched by their opportunities.\n\nI've launched this national initiative on race to help us recognize our common interests and to bridge the opportunity gaps that are keeping us from becoming one America. Let us begin by recognizing what we still must overcome. Discrimination against any American is un-American.\n\nWe must vigorously enforce the laws that make it illegal. I ask your help to end the backlog at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Sixty thousand of our fellow citizens are waiting in line for justice, and we should act now to end their wait.\n\nWe also should recognize that the greatest progress we can make toward building one America lies in the progress we make for all Americans, without regard to race.\n\nWhen we open the doors of college to all Americans, when we rid all our streets of crime, when there are jobs available to people from all our neighborhoods, when we make sure all parents have the child care they need, we're helping to build one nation. We, in this Chamber and in this Government, must do all we can to address the continuing American challenge to build one America.\n\nBut we'll only move forward if all our fellow citizens, including every one of you at home watching tonight, is also committed to this cause.\n\nWe must work together, learn together, live together, serve together. On the forge of common enterprise, Americans of all backgrounds can hammer out a common identity. We see it today in the United States military, in the Peace Corps, in AmeriCorps.\n\nWherever people of all races and backgrounds come together in a shared endeavor and get a fair chance, we do just fine. With shared values and meaningful opportunities and honest communication and citizen service, we can unite a diverse people in freedom and mutual respect.\n\nWe are many; we must be one. In that spirit, let us lift our eyes to the new millennium. How will we mark that passage?\n\nIt just happens once every 1,000 years. This year Hillary and I launched the White House Millennium Program to promote America's creativity and innovation, and to preserve our heritage and culture into the 21st century. Our culture lives in every community, and every community has places of historic value that tell our stories as Americans.\n\nI am proposing a public-private partnership to advance our arts and humanities and to celebrate the millennium by saving American's treasures, great and small. And while we honor the past, let us imagine the future. Now, think about this: The entire store of human knowledge now doubles every 5 years.\n\nIn the 1980's, scientists identified the gene causing cystic fibrosis; it took 9 years. Last year scientists located the gene that causes Parkinson's disease in only 9 days. Within a decade, \"gene chips\" will offer a roadmap for prevention of illnesses throughout a lifetime.\n\nSoon we'll be able to carry all the phone calls on Mother's Day on a single strand of fiber the width of a human hair. A child born in 1998 may well live to see the 22d century. Tonight, as part of our gift to the millennium, I propose a 21st century research fund for pathbreaking scientific inquiry, the largest funding increase in history for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the National Cancer Institute.\n\nWe have already discovered genes for breast cancer and diabetes. I ask you to support this initiative so ours will be the generation that finally wins the war against cancer and begins a revolution in our fight against all deadly diseases. As important as all this scientific progress is, we must continue to see that science serves humanity, not the other way around.\n\nWe must prevent the misuse of genetic tests to discriminate against any American. And we must ratify the ethical consensus of the scientific and religious communities and ban the cloning of human beings. We should enable all the world's people to explore the far reaches of cyberspace.\n\nThink of this: The first time I made a State of the Union speech to you, only a handful of physicists used the World Wide Web\u2014literally, just a handful of people. Now, in schools, in libraries, homes, and businesses, millions and millions of Americans surf the Net every day.\n\nWe must give parents the tools they need to help protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet, but we also must make sure that we protect the exploding global commercial potential of the Internet. We can do the kinds of things that we need to do and still protect our kids.\n\nFor one thing, I ask Congress to step up support for building the next generation Internet. It's getting kind of clogged, you know, and the next generation Internet will operate at speeds up to 1,000 times faster than today. Even as we explore this inner space in the new millennium, we're going to open new frontiers in outer space.\n\nThroughout all history, humankind has had only one place to call home, our planet, Earth. Beginning this year, 1998, men and women from 16 countries will build a foothold in the heavens, the international space station. With its vast expanses, scientists and engineers will actually set sail on an uncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential.\n\nAnd this October, a true American hero, a veteran pilot of 149 combat missions and one 5-hour space flight that changed the world, will return to the heavens. Godspeed, John Glenn. [Applause ] John, you will carry with you America's hopes.\n\nAnd on your uniform, once again, you will carry America's flag, marking the unbroken connection between the deeds of America's past and the daring of America's future. Nearly 200 years ago, a tattered flag, its broad stripes and bright stars still gleaming through the smoke of a fierce battle, moved Francis Scott Key to scribble a few words on the back of an envelope, the words that became our national anthem. Today, that Star-Spangled Banner, along with the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, are on display just a short walk from here.\n\nThey are America's treasures, and we must also save them for the ages. I ask all Americans to support our project to restore all our treasures so that the generations of the 21st century can see for themselves the images and the words that are the old and continuing glory of America, an America that has continued to rise through every age, against every challenge, a people of great works and greater possibilities, who have always, always found the wisdom and strength to come together as one nation to widen the circle of opportunity, to deepen the meaning of our freedom, to form that more perfect Union. Let that be our gift to the 21st century.\n\nGod bless you, and God bless the United States. NOTE: The President spoke at 9:12 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol.\n\nIn his remarks, he referred to former Senator Bob Dole and his wife, Elizabeth; and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
