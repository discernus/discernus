# Discernus MVP User Journeys
**From Current State to Validated Academic Platform**

*Date: June 2025*  
*Status: Strategic User Journey Mapping*  
*Focus: MVP-Critical Personas and Dual Framework Validation Approach*

> **Note on Terminology (June 2025):** This document is pending updates from the cartographic terminology refactor currently underway. Legacy terms are being replaced as follows: `Well`→`Anchor` (fixed reference points), `Dipole`→`Axis` (paired anchor dimensions), `Gravity`→`Discernus Coordinate System`, and framework outputs become `Axis Signatures` (for frameworks like MFT) or `Anchor Signatures` (for frameworks like PFT). Please interpret user experience descriptions using the new cartographic vocabulary.

## Journey Overview

This document maps detailed user journeys for the three MVP-critical personas as they engage with Discernus during the validation phase. Each journey follows a 6-8 week timeline focused on establishing academic credibility through rigorous validation of both Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) and Political Framing Theory (PFT) implementations.

**Strategic Focus**: Validation of established frameworks from moral psychology and political communication rather than novel framework development  
**Primary Goal**: Academic credibility and expert endorsement leading to dual framework publications  
**Success Criteria**: Expert approval across both frameworks, statistical validation, community adoption in computational social science and political psychology

## Journey 1: Dr. Sarah Chen - Validation Researcher
**From Conference Discovery to Collaborative Validation Study**

Dr. Sarah Chen returns from the Computational Social Science Society conference where she heard whispers about a new platform for systematic framework analysis. As a tenure-track professor specializing in political communication, she needs methodologically rigorous tools that can withstand peer review. Her next six weeks will determine whether Discernus can support her research program.

### **Week 1: Platform Discovery and Initial Assessment**

Sarah opens the Discernus platform URL she scribbled at the conference. She's immediately drawn to the validation evidence prominently displayed:

- MFT implementation correlation with MFQ-30: r=0.83 (n=500)
- PFT frame detection accuracy: >80% precision/recall on known exemplars
- Inter-LLM reliability: r=0.91 (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) across both frameworks
- Expert consultation: "MFT reviewed and approved by Jonathan Haidt lab; PFT validated by political communication researchers"

The rigorous dual-framework approach surprises her—this isn't another AI tool making inflated claims, but systematic academic methodology across both moral psychology and political communication.

### **Week 2: Pilot Testing and Academic Integration**

Sarah trains her graduate student on both Discernus MFT and PFT analysis using their existing corpus of campaign speeches. The dual framework approach provides complementary insights—MFT Axis Signatures reveal underlying values while PFT Anchor Signatures capture strategic communication patterns. The learning curve is minimal—the cartographic interface is designed for researchers, not technologists.

### **Week 3: Collaborative Research Planning**

Sarah designs a systematic validation study comparing Discernus dual framework analysis with human expert coding. She develops IRB protocols for a study involving 100 political texts coded by both Discernus and expert human coders from both moral psychology and political communication backgrounds.

### **Week 4: Data Collection and Analysis**

The validation data reveals that Discernus consistently outperforms human coders on consistency (lower variance) while maintaining equivalent accuracy across both frameworks. The human-computer correlation reaches r=0.82 for MFT and 85% agreement for PFT frame detection, exceeding her success thresholds for both frameworks.

### **Week 5: Academic Documentation and Collaboration**

Sarah writes the methodology section for her paper, describing Discernus dual framework validation in detail. She reaches out to the Discernus development team requesting collaboration on methodological papers for both moral psychology and political communication venues.

### **Week 6: Publication and Community Building**

Sarah finalizes her comparative paper incorporating both MFT and PFT Discernus methodology. She develops curriculum materials teaching dual framework analysis using Discernus for next-generation computational social scientists, demonstrating how moral and framing perspectives provide complementary insights into political discourse.

**Strategic Outcome**: Sarah transforms from skeptical evaluator to validated adopter and academic advocate, providing crucial early academic credibility for Discernus platform adoption.

## Journey 2: Independent Research Author - Platform Developer
**From Prototype to Validated Academic Infrastructure**

The Independent Research Author faces a critical six-week period determining whether months of development work can achieve academic credibility. The goal: transform Discernus from research prototype to validated academic infrastructure worthy of publication and community adoption across both moral psychology and political communication.

### **Week 1: Expert Consultation Initiation**

The researcher crafts detailed outreach to both Jonathan Haidt's lab and political framing theory researchers, approaching as academic collaboration rather than endorsement request. Complete MFT and PFT implementation documentation and preliminary validation results (MFT r=0.78 in pilot; PFT 78% frame detection accuracy) are prepared.

### **Week 2: Dual Framework Validation Infrastructure**

The researcher designs systematic validation comparing Discernus MFT outputs with MFQ-30 responses (n=500 participants) and PFT outputs with expert-coded frame detection studies. Cross-LLM reliability testing reveals inter-LLM consistency (r=0.91 between GPT-4 and Claude across both frameworks).

### **Week 3: Expert Feedback Integration**

The Haidt lab provides detailed feedback: "Highly faithful to MFT theory" with methodological suggestions for enhanced lexical markers. Political communication researchers approve PFT implementation: "Accurate operationalization of both Entman and Lakoff frameworks." Both validation studies approved: "Design appropriate for academic publication."

### **Week 4: Validation Execution and Analysis**

Comprehensive statistical analysis reveals strong validation with MFT overall correlation r=0.83 (p<0.001) and foundation-specific correlations ranging from r=0.78 to r=0.89. PFT validation shows 85% frame detection accuracy and successful arc clustering hypothesis testing for Lakoff framework.

### **Week 5: Academic Documentation and Publication**

With validation complete and expert approval across both frameworks, the researcher drafts dual academic papers: "Computational Validation of Moral Foundations Theory" with Jonathan Haidt as co-author, and "Systematic Political Framing Analysis: Computational Implementation of Entman-Lakoff Integration" with political communication researchers.

### **Week 6: Publication and Platform Launch**

Discernus launches publicly with validated dual framework implementation, academic documentation prominent, expert endorsements clearly attributed across both moral psychology and political communication, and research-grade reliability standards for both frameworks.

**Strategic Outcome**: Transformation from research prototype to academically validated platform with expert endorsement and publication pathway established.

## Journey 3: Framework Originators - Expert Endorsement
**From Initial Skepticism to Academic Endorsement**

### Dr. Jonathan Haidt - Moral Foundations Theory Expert

Dr. Jonathan Haidt receives an email requesting consultation on computational implementation of Moral Foundations Theory. As the framework originator, he's seen numerous attempts to operationalize MFT computationally—most oversimplify or misrepresent the theory.

### **Week 1: Initial Assessment and Skeptical Evaluation**

Haidt receives detailed documentation showing unusual sophistication: foundation-specific lexicons derived from validated MFT research, prompt templates that capture theoretical nuances, and scoring protocols that avoid common MFT misinterpretations.

### **Week 2: Detailed Implementation Feedback**

Haidt provides detailed feedback on each foundation implementation, from Care/Harm ("accurately capture care vs. harm distinction") to Sanctity/Degradation ("most challenging foundation operationalized well").

### **Week 3: Validation Study Oversight**

After reviewing implementation refinements, Haidt provides final approval for validation study with formal endorsement for proceeding with full validation.

### **Week 4: Statistical Validation and Academic Standards**

Haidt reviews final validation results showing foundation-specific correlations with MFQ-30 ranging from r=0.78 to r=0.89, all p<0.001. Academic judgment: "Methodology suitable for top-tier journal publication."

### **Week 5: Academic Endorsement and Collaboration**

Haidt provides formal academic endorsement and agrees to co-author methodology paper: "Computational Validation of Moral Foundations Theory."

### **Week 6: Academic Integration and Future Collaboration**

Haidt establishes ongoing collaboration including quarterly consultation on Discernus MFT refinements and joint grant proposals for computational psychology research.

### Dr. Political Communication Researcher - Political Framing Theory Expert

Concurrently, leading political communication researchers receive similar outreach regarding the computational implementation of Political Framing Theory (Entman-Lakoff integration).

### **Week 1: Framework Integration Assessment**

Political communication experts review the sophisticated integration of Entman's four framing functions with Lakoff's family model theory, noting the novel arc clustering hypothesis testing approach using Anchor Signatures in the Discernus Coordinate System.

### **Week 2: Theoretical Validation**

Experts provide feedback on both Lakoff framework implementation ("Arc clustering hypothesis provides innovative empirical test of family model coherence") and Entman framework ("Independent wells approach correctly preserves function independence").

### **Week 3: Methodological Approval**

After reviewing the geometric clustering analysis methodology and frame detection protocols, experts approve the validation study design as "methodologically sound for testing both frameworks."

### **Week 4: Frame Detection Validation**

Experts review validation results showing 85% frame detection accuracy and successful arc clustering hypothesis validation. Assessment: "First systematic computational validation of political framing theory integration."

### **Week 5: Collaboration Agreement**

Political communication researchers agree to co-author methodology paper: "Systematic Political Framing Analysis: Computational Implementation of Entman-Lakoff Integration."

### **Week 6: Community Integration**

Experts facilitate integration with political communication research community and establish ongoing consultation framework for PFT refinements.
