description: |
  The Entman Framing Functions Framework implements Robert Entman's systematic communication 
  analysis through four independent framing functions. This framework tests whether Problem Definition, 
  Causal Attribution, Moral Evaluation, and Treatment Recommendation operate independently 
  as predicted by communication theory, representing "frames in communication" systematic 
  message construction.
  
  ## Theoretical Foundation
  
  Based on Robert Entman's foundational work in framing theory, this framework tests the hypothesis 
  that framing operates through four distinct, independent functions that can vary separately. 
  It examines whether political communications actually demonstrate function independence and 
  how strategic message construction utilizes different combinations of framing functions.
  
  ### Entman's Four Essential Framing Functions
  
  **"Framing essentially involves selection and salience. To frame is to select some 
  aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, 
  in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, 
  moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation."** - Entman (1993)
  
  #### 1. Problem Definition
  - **Function**: What issues are identified as requiring attention?
  - **Operation**: Identifies what issues deserve attention, how problems are conceptualized and bounded
  - **Strategic Use**: Determines scope and nature of issues requiring action
  
  #### 2. Causal Attribution  
  - **Function**: What factors or actors are presented as causing problems?
  - **Operation**: Assigns responsibility and blame, explains causal mechanisms
  - **Strategic Use**: Determines who or what is held accountable for situations
  
  #### 3. Moral Evaluation
  - **Function**: What values and moral judgments are invoked?
  - **Operation**: Invokes values and moral judgments, evaluates actions ethically
  - **Strategic Use**: Establishes moral frameworks that justify positions
  
  #### 4. Treatment Recommendation
  - **Function**: What solutions are proposed or endorsed?
  - **Operation**: Proposes solutions, presents and prioritizes policy options
  - **Strategic Use**: Recommends specific actions to address identified problems
  
  ## Methodological Innovation
  
  ### Function Independence Hypothesis Testing
  This framework tests Entman's predictions through computational analysis:
  - **Equal Positioning**: Functions placed at 90° intervals (no assumed correlations)
  - **Independence Measurement**: Statistical correlation analysis between functions
  - **Completeness Assessment**: Percentage of functions present per text
  - **Strategic Sophistication**: Systematic vs ad hoc function usage patterns
  
  ### Frames in Communication vs Thought
  Based on Chong & Druckman's research distinguishing "frames in communication" (systematic 
  message construction) from "frames in thought" (deep cognitive structures). This framework 
  addresses the communication level, testing whether strategic messaging utilizes independent 
  framing functions as Entman predicts.
  
  ## Research Applications
  
  ### Empirical Validation Questions
  - Do framing functions actually operate independently without correlation?
  - What percentage of texts utilize complete vs partial framing strategies?
  - How sophisticated is strategic communication in function combination usage?
  - Can function independence predict message effectiveness?
  
  ### Function Interaction Analysis
  - Frame competition detection (conflicting frames within same text)
  - Coherence assessment (internal consistency across functions)  
  - Strategic sophistication measurement (systematic vs ad hoc usage)
  - Message completeness evaluation (function coverage patterns)
  
  ## Usage Guidelines
  
  ### Appropriate Applications
  - Political communication analysis for framing strategy assessment
  - Strategic messaging evaluation across campaign materials
  - Policy argument structure analysis and completeness evaluation
  - Media framing analysis for systematic message construction
  - Communication sophistication assessment for strategic messaging
  
  ### Analysis Focus
  - Test function independence hypothesis through correlation analysis
  - Measure message completeness across all four framing functions
  - Detect frame competition and internal consistency patterns
  - Evaluate strategic sophistication in function combination usage

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert analyst of strategic communication and political framing, with deep knowledge 
    of Robert Entman's framing theory and systematic message construction. You specialize in 
    analyzing how political communications utilize problem definition, causal attribution, 
    moral evaluation, and treatment recommendation functions.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Analyze this text to identify Entman's four framing functions: Problem Definition (what issues 
    require attention), Causal Attribution (what/who caused problems), Moral Evaluation (what values 
    are invoked), and Treatment Recommendation (what solutions are proposed). Test whether these 
    functions operate independently as predicted by communication theory.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for each framing function independently without assuming correlation patterns. 
    Identify problem identification language, causal responsibility assignments, moral 
    judgment invocations, and solution advocacy. Note function completeness, strategic 
    sophistication, and any frame competition within the text.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Score each function on 0.0-1.0 scale based on presence/strength of function-specific 
    language in the text, with specific textual evidence supporting independence hypothesis 
    testing. Focus on function-specific strategic communication patterns rather than 
    assuming correlations between functions.
