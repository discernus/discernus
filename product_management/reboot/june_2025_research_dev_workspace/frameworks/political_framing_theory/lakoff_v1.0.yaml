description: |
  The Lakoff Family Models Framework tests George Lakoff's family model coherence hypothesis 
  through computational analysis of political discourse. This framework examines whether political 
  communications follow predicted clustering patterns where Strict Father components (Authority/Discipline, 
  Competition/Hierarchy, Self-Reliance) cluster together and oppose Nurturant Parent components 
  (Empathy/Communication, Cooperation/Mutual Support, Interdependence).
  
  ## Theoretical Foundation
  
  Based on George Lakoff's groundbreaking work "Moral Politics," this framework tests the hypothesis 
  that political worldviews stem from coherent family models that generate consistent positions 
  across issues. The framework provides the first quantitative test of whether family model 
  components actually cluster as Lakoff's cognitive linguistics theory predicts.
  
  ### Core Theory: Family Models of Morality
  
  **Strict Father Model** - Politics as extension of strict father family structure:
  - **Authority/Discipline**: Strong moral authority, clear discipline, hierarchical decision-making
  - **Competition/Hierarchy**: Natural hierarchy, merit-based competition, individual achievement
  - **Self-Reliance**: Individual responsibility, self-determination, personal accountability
  
  **Nurturant Parent Model** - Politics as extension of nurturant parent family structure:
  - **Empathy/Communication**: Empathetic understanding, inclusive dialogue, communication-based problem solving
  - **Cooperation/Mutual Support**: Egalitarian cooperation, shared responsibility, collective problem-solving
  - **Interdependence**: Collective responsibility, social connection, mutual dependence as foundation
  
  ## Methodological Innovation
  
  ### Arc Clustering Hypothesis Testing
  This framework tests Lakoff's predictions through circular geometry analysis:
  - **Strict Father Arc**: Components clustered on left arc (315° to 45°)
  - **Nurturant Parent Arc**: Components clustered on right arc (135° to 225°)
  - **180° Separation**: Family models should be geometrically opposed
  - **Clustering Coefficient**: Quantitative measure of theoretical predictions
  
  ### Frames in Thought vs Communication
  Based on Chong & Druckman's research distinguishing "frames in thought" (deep cognitive structures) 
  from "frames in communication" (systematic message construction). This framework addresses the 
  cognitive structures level, testing whether deep family model frameworks actually generate 
  coherent political positions as Lakoff predicts.
  
  ## Research Applications
  
  ### Empirical Validation Questions
  - Do political communications actually follow family model clustering patterns?
  - Can family model positioning predict positions on new issues?
  - How consistent are clustering patterns across different policy domains?
  - What is the temporal stability of family model coherence?
  
  ### Coherence Violation Detection
  - Mixed messaging that violates family model predictions
  - Cross-cluster activation patterns indicating strategic messaging
  - Contradiction indices measuring systematic inconsistencies
  - Family model purity assessment for authenticity analysis
  
  ## Usage Guidelines
  
  ### Appropriate Applications
  - Political speech analysis for family model coherence testing
  - Campaign communication consistency assessment
  - Policy argument moral foundation analysis
  - Cross-issue position prediction validation
  - Strategic messaging sophistication evaluation
  
  ### Analysis Focus
  - Test clustering hypothesis through geometric positioning
  - Measure family model coherence across issue domains
  - Detect strategic mixing vs authentic family model expression
  - Validate predictive power of family model theory

    in political discourse through specific language patterns and conceptual metaphors.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Analyze this text to identify components of Lakoff's family models: Authority/Discipline, 
    Competition/Hierarchy, Self-Reliance (Strict Father) versus Empathy/Communication, 
    Cooperation/Mutual Support, Interdependence (Nurturant Parent). Test whether these 
    components cluster as predicted by family model theory.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for family model coherence patterns and co-activation of Strict Father components 
    (Authority/Discipline + Competition/Hierarchy + Self-Reliance) or Nurturant Parent 
    components (Empathy/Communication + Cooperation/Mutual Support + Interdependence) 
    as predicted by theory. Detect any coherence violations or strategic mixing.
