description: |
  The IDITI framework analyzes the fundamental tension between individual dignity and tribal identity 
  in political discourse. This specialized framework focuses on how texts either affirm universal 
  human worth or prioritize group-based identity and loyalty, examining the core moral question of 
  whether human dignity is universal or conditional on group membership.
  
  ## Theoretical Foundation
  
  This framework examines narratives through the lens of individual dignity versus tribal identity, 
  drawing on theories of identity formation and collective psychology. It analyzes how language 
  reinforces or challenges the tension between personal autonomy and group allegiance.
  
  ### Primary Theoretical Sources
  - **Fukuyama's Identity Theory**: The demand for dignity and politics of resentment
  - **Jung's Collective Psychology**: Individual vs. collective identity concepts
  - **Universal Dignity Principle**: Inherent worth regardless of group membership
  - **Identity Politics Analysis**: Group-based moral frameworks and exclusion patterns
  
  ## Framework Structure
  
  ### Core Binary Opposition: Identity Axis
  
  **Dignity (Integrative)** - Affirms individual moral worth and universal rights, regardless of 
  group identity. Emphasizes agency, pluralism, and character over affiliation. Treats people 
  as individuals with inherent worth.
  
  **Tribalism (Disintegrative)** - Prioritizes group dominance, loyalty, or identity over individual 
  agency. Often frames moral worth in in-group/out-group terms. Defines moral worth through group 
  membership and loyalty.
  
  ## Analysis Focus
  
  ### Primary Research Questions
  1. Does the text treat people as individuals with inherent worth?
  2. Does the text define moral worth through group membership?
  3. How does the text balance individual agency vs. group loyalty?
  
  ### Scoring Methodology
  - Focus on identity-based moral frameworks rather than policy positions
  - Examine how the text treats human worth: universal vs. conditional on group membership
  - Analyze the tension between personal autonomy and group allegiance
  - Score based on textual evidence with specific quotations
  
  ## Usage Guidelines
  
  ### Appropriate Applications
  - Political speeches and campaign materials analyzing identity appeals
  - Social commentary and editorial content with identity components
  - Policy arguments examining identity-based moral frameworks
  - Cultural and social movement discourse analysis
  - Democratic discourse quality assessment through identity lens
  
  ### Interpretation Framework
  - **High Dignity Scores**: Universal human worth affiliation, individual agency emphasis
  - **High Tribalism Scores**: Group-based moral hierarchies, identity politics patterns
  - **Balanced Scores**: Mixed identity appeals requiring detailed analysis
  - **Intensity Measures**: Strength of identity-based moral positioning
  
  ## Academic Applications
  
  ### Research Applications
  - How do political figures balance individual dignity vs. tribal appeals?
  - What linguistic patterns indicate identity-based moral frameworks?
  - How does identity framing affect democratic discourse quality?
  - Cross-cultural validation of dignity vs. tribalism dimensions
  - Temporal analysis of identity rhetoric evolution

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert analyst of political identity and group psychology, with deep knowledge 
    of individual dignity theory and tribal psychology. You specialize in analyzing how discourse 
    either affirms universal human dignity or appeals to tribal identity and group loyalty.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Evaluate how the text either affirms individual dignity and universal human worth OR appeals 
    to tribal identity and group-based moral distinctions. Focus specifically on the tension 
    between treating people as individuals with inherent worth versus defining people primarily 
    through group membership and loyalty.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for patterns of moral reasoning that either affirm universal human dignity or prioritize
    group identity and tribal belonging. Analyze both explicit statements and implicit assumptions
    about the source of human moral worth. Examine how the text treats human worth: universal 
    vs. conditional on group membership.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Score coordinates based on textual evidence of identity orientation, using 0.0-1.0 scale 
    with specific quotations supporting each assessment. Focus on identity-based moral frameworks 
    rather than policy positions. Look for linguistic patterns that indicate dignity affirmation 
    vs tribal exclusion.
