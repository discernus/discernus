  Individual Dignity Identity v Tribal Identity - A specialized Discernus Coordinates
  framework focusing on the tension between individual dignity and tribal identity
  in persuasive discourse. This framework examines the fundamental tension between
  affirming universal human dignity versus prioritizing group loyalty and tribal belonging.

      name: "Dignity"
      description: |
        Affirms individual moral worth and universal rights, regardless of group identity. 
        Emphasizes agency, pluralism, and character over affiliation.
      
      language_cues:
        - "equal dignity"
        - "inherent worth"

    disintegrative:
      name: "Tribalism"
      description: |
        Prioritizes group dominance, loyalty, or identity over individual agency.

# =============================================================================
# THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
# =============================================================================

theoretical_foundation:
  primary_sources:
    - "Fukuyama, F. (2018). Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment."
    - "Jung, C. G. (1921). Psychological Types. (Concepts of Individual vs. Collective Identity)"
  theoretical_approach: |
    This framework examines narratives through the lens of individual dignity versus tribal identity,
    drawing on theories of identity formation and collective psychology. It analyzes how language
    reinforces or challenges the tension between personal autonomy and group allegiance.

# ANALYSIS METRICS
# =============================================================================

metrics:
  identity_axis_score:
    name: "Identity Axis Score"
    description: "Position on dignity-tribalism axis from integrative (+1) to disintegrative (-1)"
    calculation: "Dignity score minus Tribalism score"
  
  identity_intensity:
    name: "Identity Intensity"
    description: "Strength of identity-based moral positioning"
    calculation: "Absolute value of axis score"

# =============================================================================
# PROMPT CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert analyst of political identity and group psychology, with deep knowledge 
    of individual dignity theory and tribal psychology. You specialize in analyzing how discourse 
    either affirms universal human dignity or appeals to tribal identity and group loyalty.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Evaluate how the text either affirms individual dignity and universal human worth OR appeals 
    to tribal identity and group-based moral distinctions. Focus specifically on the tension 
    between treating people as individuals with inherent worth versus defining people primarily 
    through group membership and loyalty.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for patterns of moral reasoning that either affirm universal human dignity or prioritize
    group identity and tribal belonging. Analyze both explicit statements and implicit assumptions
    about the source of human moral worth.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Score coordinates based on textual evidence of identity orientation, using 0.0-1.0 scale 
    with specific quotations supporting each assessment. Focus on identity-based moral frameworks 
    rather than policy positions.
