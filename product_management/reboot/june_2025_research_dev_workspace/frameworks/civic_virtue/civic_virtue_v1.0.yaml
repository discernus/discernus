  The Civic Virtue Framework analyzes moral dimensions of persuasive political discourse through 
  classical virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican theory. This framework identifies 
  dimensions that strengthen or weaken democratic discourse and civic engagement using clustered 
  positioning around civic virtues and vices.
  
  ## Theoretical Foundation
  
  Based on Aristotelian virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican theory, this framework 
  examines civic virtues and vices in political communication:
  
  - **Classical Foundation**: Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics* (Book VI) on virtue and character
  - **Contemporary Application**: Sandel's civic republican theory on moral limits and civic engagement
  - **Core Insight**: Democratic discourse quality depends on the balance of civic virtues versus civic vices
  
  ## Framework Architecture
  
  ### Clustered Positioning Strategy
  - **Virtue Cluster (Top)**: 5 anchors clustered around 90° emphasizing civic strengths
  - **Vice Cluster (Bottom)**: 5 anchors clustered around 270° emphasizing civic weaknesses
  - **Moral Hierarchy**: Vertical orientation emphasizing virtue-vice distinction
  
  ### The Ten Civic Dimensions
  
  **Civic Virtues (Integrative Anchors):**
  1. **Dignity** - Individual moral worth and universal human dignity
  2. **Truth** - Factual accuracy and intellectual honesty
  3. **Justice** - Fairness, proportionality, and procedural equity
  4. **Hope** - Constructive vision and democratic optimism
  5. **Pragmatism** - Practical solutions and workable compromise
  
  **Civic Vices (Disintegrative Anchors):**
  1. **Tribalism** - Group loyalty over universal principles
  2. **Resentment** - Grievance, victimization, and blame
  3. **Manipulation** - Deceptive rhetoric and emotional exploitation
  4. **Fear** - Anxiety appeals and catastrophic thinking
  5. **Fantasy** - Unrealistic expectations and magical thinking
  
  ## Usage Guidelines
  
  ### Ideal Applications
  - Political speech analysis for civic virtue content
  - Democratic discourse quality assessment
  - Campaign communication ethics evaluation
  - Public debate moral dimension analysis
  
  ### Scoring Approach
  - Each anchor scored 0.0-1.0 based on presence/strength in text
  - Specific textual evidence required for each score
  - Cluster-based analysis considering virtue vs. vice balance
  - Overall civic discourse quality metrics
  
  ### Interpretation Framework
  - **High Virtue Cluster Scores**: Strengthens democratic discourse and civic engagement
  - **High Vice Cluster Scores**: Undermines democratic discourse and civic participation
  - **Balanced Patterns**: Mixed civic impact requiring detailed analysis
  - **Cluster Dominance**: Clear moral orientation toward virtue or vice

# LLM INTEGRATION (optional)
# =============================================================================

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert analyst of civic life and democratic participation, with deep 
    knowledge of civic republican theory and social capital research. You specialize 
    in analyzing how discourse either promotes or undermines civic engagement through 
    virtue and vice patterns.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Evaluate how the text demonstrates civic virtues (dignity, truth, justice, hope, pragmatism) 
    OR civic vices (tribalism, resentment, manipulation, fear, fantasy). Focus specifically on 
    moral dimensions that strengthen or weaken democratic discourse and civic participation.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for patterns that either encourage civic virtues and democratic participation 
    or express civic vices and democratic withdrawal. Analyze both explicit moral 
    language and implicit assumptions about civic responsibility, democratic institutions, 
    and community involvement.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Score civic dimensions based on textual evidence of virtue/vice emphasis, using 
    0.0-1.0 scale with specific quotations supporting each assessment. Focus on 
    civic frameworks rather than specific policy positions. Consider hierarchical 
    weighting: primary (1.0), secondary (0.8), tertiary (0.6).
