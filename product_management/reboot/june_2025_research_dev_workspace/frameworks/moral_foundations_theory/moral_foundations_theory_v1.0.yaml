  Enhanced Moral Foundations Theory framework implementing Jonathan Haidt's research 
  with systematic methodological improvements for academic rigor and configurable 
  algorithm support. This framework analyzes moral reasoning through six foundation 
  pairs that represent evolved psychological mechanisms cultures build upon to create moral systems.
  
  ## Theoretical Foundation
  
  Based on Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory which identifies innate psychological foundations 
  that cultures build upon to create diverse moral systems. The theory proposes that human 
  morality is built upon several foundations, not just care and fairness as traditionally 
  emphasized in moral psychology. These foundations evolved to address adaptive challenges 
  faced by humans living in groups.
  
  ### The Six Foundation Pairs
  
  1. **Care ↔ Harm**: Evolved from mammalian attachment and empathy
     - Care: Compassion, protection, helping others
     - Harm: Cruelty, violence, causing suffering
  
  2. **Fairness ↔ Cheating**: Evolved from reciprocal altruism
     - Fairness: Justice, equality, proportional treatment
     - Cheating: Exploitation, unfair advantage, corruption
  
  3. **Loyalty ↔ Betrayal**: Evolved from group cooperation needs
     - Loyalty: Patriotism, solidarity, sacrifice for group
     - Betrayal: Disloyalty, treason, abandoning group
  
  4. **Authority ↔ Subversion**: Evolved from hierarchical social structures
     - Authority: Respect for hierarchy, tradition, order
     - Subversion: Rebellion, chaos, undermining leadership
  
  5. **Sanctity ↔ Degradation**: Evolved from contamination avoidance
     - Sanctity: Purity, sacredness, spiritual elevation
     - Degradation: Contamination, debasement, pollution
  
  6. **Liberty ↔ Oppression**: Evolved from responses to domination
     - Liberty: Freedom, autonomy, resistance to coercion
     - Oppression: Domination, restriction of autonomy, tyranny
  
  ### Political Psychology Insights
  
  - **Liberals**: Primarily rely on individualizing foundations (Care, Fairness)
  - **Conservatives**: Use all foundations more equally
  - **Libertarians**: Emphasize Liberty foundation when included
  
  ## Usage Guidelines
  
  ### Appropriate Text Types
  - Political speeches and statements
  - Policy documents and arguments  
  - Social commentary and opinion pieces
  - Campaign materials and manifestos
  - Legislative debates and justifications
  
  ### Analysis Metrics
  - **Individualizing Score**: Care + Fairness foundation strength
  - **Binding Score**: Loyalty + Authority + Sanctity foundation strength  
  - **Liberty Score**: Liberty vs Oppression positioning
  - **Moral Diversity Index**: Breadth across all foundations
  
  ## Enhanced Detection Methodology
  
  Beyond basic keywords, this framework uses sophisticated moral reasoning detection:
  - **Syntactic Analysis**: Moral imperatives, causal moral language, conditional statements
  - **Semantic Analysis**: Agent-patient structures, moral justification patterns, value attribution
  - **Metaphorical Analysis**: Care metaphors ("safety net"), fairness metaphors ("level playing field")
  - **Narrative Analysis**: Victim-perpetrator-rescuer roles, moral hero/villain characterization
  
  ## Version History

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert in moral psychology and value analysis with deep knowledge 
    of how moral reasoning manifests in discourse across cultures and political 
    orientations. You specialize in identifying implicit moral frameworks.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Analyze the values, principles, and moral reasoning present in this text. 
    Identify what moral concerns are emphasized, what behaviors are praised or 
    criticized, and what underlying value systems guide the reasoning.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for patterns of moral reasoning including: protection of vulnerable 
    individuals, concerns about fair treatment, group loyalty and solidarity, 
    respect for authority and tradition, and spiritual or purity concerns. 
    Also identify moral violations: harm, cheating, betrayal, subversion, degradation, oppression.
    Analyze both explicit statements and implicit moral assumptions.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Score moral dimensions based on textual evidence of value emphasis, using 
    0.0-1.0 scale with specific quotations supporting each assessment. Focus on 
    strength of moral concern rather than political affiliation predictions.
  
  enhanced_detection_instructions: |
    Beyond explicit moral vocabulary, identify: (1) Syntactic patterns like moral 
    imperatives and causal moral reasoning, (2) Metaphorical expressions of values, 
    (3) Narrative moral positioning and role assignments, (4) Agent-patient 
    structures revealing moral agency, (5) Collective identity construction patterns.
