# Assessment of Documentation, Onboarding, and System Fit (June 21, 2025)

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. MECEC Compliance (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive, Current)
- **Status:** A+
- **Findings:** Documentation is explicitly MECEC-compliant, with clear audience separation, exhaustive coverage, and up-to-date content. There are dedicated procedures and audits for maintaining MECEC standards, and all major documents reference these principles.

### 2. Internal Coherence
- **Status:** A
- **Findings:** Terminology is consistent, navigation is logical, and cross-references are well-maintained. Audience mapping is clear, and deprecated systems are properly documented with migration guidance. Quality standards (academic rigor, reproducibility, accessibility, version control) are emphasized throughout.

### 3. Fit with Working Production Pipeline
- **Status:** A
- **Findings:** Documentation accurately describes the current production pipeline, including unified framework validation, orchestrator integration, experiment validation, and QA. All workflows and commands match the actual codebase, and there are no significant mismatches or obsolete references.

### 4. Dockerization Context
- **Status:** C
- **Findings:** While Docker is referenced in some places, the main README and onboarding docs do not foreground Docker as the primary or recommended environment. Installation instructions focus on Python virtual environments. If Docker is required or preferred, this context needs to be set more explicitly.

### 5. Onboarding Experience
- **Status:** B+/A-
- **Findings:** Documentation is comprehensive and well-organized, but the onboarding journey could be streamlined. Quickstart guides, experiment indexing, and per-experiment documentation can be improved to lower the barrier for new users.

### 6. Research Workspace & Frameworks
- **Status:** A-
- **Findings:** Research workspace assets are self-contained and reproducible, with descriptive naming and validation studies. Some experiment directories could benefit from more metadata and summaries.
