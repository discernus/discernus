# Strategic Pivot: From Dual Framework to Staged Framework MVP

**Response to PFT Expert Review**  
**Date:** June 19, 2025  
**Status:** Strategic Recalibration  
**Decision:** Staged MVP Approach Prioritizing Academic Rigor  

## Executive Summary

Expert review of our Political Framing Theory (PFT) framework identified fundamental methodological vulnerabilities that would prevent academic publication. While the theoretical foundation is solid, the implementation requires an 8-month methodological repair process. This document outlines a strategic pivot to a **staged MVP approach** that prioritizes academic credibility while maintaining our long-term dual framework vision.

## Review Impact Assessment

### **PFT Framework Status**
- **Theoretical Foundation**: ✅ Strong (Entman + Lakoff integration)
- **Implementation**: ❌ "Academically ambitious but presently brittle"
- **Timeline to Academic Rigor**: 8 months of systematic methodological repair
- **Risk Level**: High - would not survive peer review in current state

### **MFT Framework Status**
- **Theoretical Foundation**: ✅ Excellent (Haidt's established theory)
- **Implementation**: ⚠️ Good with minor lexical improvements needed
- **Timeline to Academic Rigor**: 2-3 months for optimization
- **Risk Level**: Low - strong foundation with clear validation pathway

### **Strategic Implications**
- **Dual framework MVP**: High risk due to PFT vulnerabilities
- **Timeline impact**: 8-month delay for rigorous dual framework implementation
- **Academic credibility**: Cannot proceed with PFT in current state
- **Resource allocation**: Should prioritize proven approach over experimental one

## Strategic Options Analysis

### **Option 1: Proceed with Dual Framework (High Risk)**
**Timeline**: 8 months  
**Approach**: Implement PFT methodological repair plan while developing MFT  

*Advantages:*
- Maintains dual framework vision
- Demonstrates multi-framework capability
- Provides comprehensive discourse analysis

*Disadvantages:*
- **High academic risk**: PFT repairs may fail validation
- **Resource intensive**: Parallel development and validation streams
- **Delayed market entry**: 8-month timeline before any MVP
- **All-or-nothing risk**: If PFT fails, entire approach questioned

*Assessment*: **Not Recommended** - violates academic risk management principles

### **Option 2: PFT-Only Pivot (Misaligned)**
**Timeline**: 8 months  
**Approach**: Focus entirely on fixing PFT, delay MFT  

*Advantages:*
- Demonstrates methodological sophistication
- Novel theoretical contribution if successful

*Disadvantages:*
- **Abandons proven approach**: MFT has clear validation pathway
- **Higher technical risk**: Experimental framework over established one
- **Reduced expert support**: Less clear collaboration pathway
- **Opportunity cost**: Delays validated approach for experimental one

*Assessment*: **Not Recommended** - prioritizes experimental over proven approach

### **Option 3: Staged Framework MVP (Recommended)**
**Phase 1 Timeline**: 3 months (MFT-focused MVP)  
**Phase 2 Timeline**: 8 months (PFT methodological repair and integration)  

*Approach:*
- **Phase 1**: MFT-only MVP with academic rigor focus
- **Phase 2**: PFT enhancement following methodological repair plan
- **Phase 3**: Dual framework integration after both independently validated

*Advantages:*
- **Risk mitigation**: Proven framework first, experimental second
- **Faster market entry**: 3-month timeline to validated MVP
- **Academic credibility**: Strong foundation with clear expansion pathway
- **Resource efficiency**: Sequential rather than parallel development
- **Expert collaboration**: Clear Haidt lab pathway for Phase 1

*Assessment*: **Strongly Recommended** - optimal risk/reward balance

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### **Phase 1 Risks and Mitigations**
**Risk**: MFT validation fails to meet targets

## Conclusion

The staged framework MVP approach transforms the expert review from a setback into a strategic advantage. By prioritizing proven methodologies over experimental ones, we build academic credibility systematically while maintaining our long-term dual framework vision.

**Phase 1** establishes our credibility with a rigorously validated MFT implementation, creating a solid foundation for academic collaboration and community adoption.

**Phase 2** demonstrates our ability to enhance experimental frameworks to academic standards, positioning us as methodological leaders rather than just another AI tool.

**Phase 3** realizes our dual framework vision from a position of strength, with both frameworks independently validated and expert-endorsed.

This approach aligns with our repository principles of enhancing rather than replacing existing systems, validating before building, and prioritizing academic rigor over speed to market.

**Next Action**: Update MVP planning documents to reflect staged approach, beginning with MFT Excellence MVP implementation.
