# June 2025 Research Development Workspace

**Project**: Moral Foundations Theory Implementation & Academic Validation  
**Timeline**: June 2025 - September 2025  
**Status**: Phase 0 - Asset Management Foundation Complete  
**Lead Researcher**: Discernus Team

## **Project Overview**

This research workspace contains the development assets for implementing a theoretically accurate Moral Foundations Theory framework and establishing the unified asset management architecture for disciplined, defensible, replicable, and auditable research capabilities.

### **Primary Objectives**

1. **Theoretical Accuracy**: Implement Haidt's MFT as proper dipole pairs, not independent wells
2. **Academic Credibility**: Prepare framework for expert consultation with Haidt lab
3. **Asset Management**: Establish unified YAML-based asset development workflow
4. **Validation Ready**: Prepare for MFQ-30 correlation studies and peer review

### **Strategic Context**

This workspace represents the **Phase 0** implementation of the unified asset management architecture, establishing the foundation for academic validation and expert collaboration. The work here directly supports the 13-week Discernus MVP Academic Validation strategy.
