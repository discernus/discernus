# Moral Foundations Theory Framework

**Version**: v2025.06.19  
**Status**: ✅ Expert Consultation Ready  
**Implementation**: Theoretically Validated Dipole Structure

## **Overview**

This framework implements Jonathan Haidt's **Moral Foundations Theory** as a computational text analysis tool. It represents the five core moral foundations as dipole pairs, following Haidt's theoretical model of evolved psychological mechanisms that underlie human moral reasoning across cultures.

## **Theoretical Foundation**

### **Core Theory**
Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory proposes that human morality is built upon several innate psychological foundations, not just care and fairness as traditionally emphasized in moral psychology. These foundations evolved to address adaptive challenges faced by humans living in groups.

### **The Five Foundation Pairs**

1. **Care ↔ Harm**: Evolved from mammalian attachment and empathy
   - Care: Compassion, protection, helping others
   - Harm: Cruelty, violence, causing suffering

2. **Fairness ↔ Cheating**: Evolved from reciprocal altruism
   - Fairness: Justice, equality, proportional treatment
   - Cheating: Exploitation, unfair advantage, corruption

3. **Loyalty ↔ Betrayal**: Evolved from group cooperation needs
   - Loyalty: Patriotism, solidarity, sacrifice for group
   - Betrayal: Disloyalty, treason, abandoning group

4. **Authority ↔ Subversion**: Evolved from hierarchical social structures
   - Authority: Respect for hierarchy, tradition, order
   - Subversion: Rebellion, chaos, undermining leadership

5. **Sanctity ↔ Degradation**: Evolved from contamination avoidance
   - Sanctity: Purity, sacredness, spiritual elevation
   - Degradation: Contamination, debasement, pollution

## **Political Psychology Insights**

### **Foundation Usage Patterns**
- **Liberals**: Primarily rely on **individualizing foundations** (Care, Fairness)
- **Conservatives**: Use **all five foundations** more equally
- **Libertarians**: Emphasize **Liberty** (when included as 6th foundation)

### **Academic Validation**
- **Cross-cultural validation** across 67+ countries
- **Strong correlation** with liberal-conservative political orientation
- **Validated instruments**: MFQ-30, MFQ-2 questionnaires
- **Robust empirical support** in political psychology literature

## **Implementation Details**

### **Framework Structure**
```yaml
framework_type: dipoles_based
coordinate_system: circular
foundations: 5 dipole pairs
weighting: hierarchical (primary/secondary/tertiary)
```

### **Foundation Weights**
- **Primary Tier** (1.0): Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating
- **Secondary Tier** (0.8): Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion  
- **Tertiary Tier** (0.6): Sanctity/Degradation

### **Language Recognition**
Each foundation includes **validated language cues** derived from:
- Moral Foundations Dictionary (Graham et al.)
- Cross-cultural linguistic analysis
- Political discourse analysis

## **Usage Guidelines**

### **Appropriate Text Types**
- Political speeches and statements
- Policy documents and arguments  
- Social commentary and opinion pieces
- Campaign materials and manifestos
- Legislative debates and justifications

### **Analysis Metrics**
- **Individualizing Score**: Care + Fairness foundation strength
- **Binding Score**: Loyalty + Authority + Sanctity foundation strength  
- **Moral Diversity Index**: Breadth across all foundations
- **Political Profile**: Ratio indicating political orientation
