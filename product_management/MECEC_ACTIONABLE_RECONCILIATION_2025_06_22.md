# MECEC ACTIONABLE Items Reconciliation & Integration Plan
**Date:** June 22, 2025  
**Status:** üéØ **ACTIVE** - Pre-iteration reconciliation for Week 2 (June 23-28)  
**MECEC Compliance:** Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive, Current

---

## üéØ **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Bottom-Line-Up-Front:** Five ACTIONABLE strategic documents require immediate reconciliation with the current MVP iteration plan. **Critical Timeline Conflict Identified:** Current iteration allocates 1 week for terminology refactor, but detailed implementation plan requires 12 weeks. **Resolution:** Implement staged approach with core functionality this week, full refactor over extended timeline.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Execute Scoped Terminology Refactor** (Week 2) - Core API and framework changes only
2. **Integrate Color Optimization** - Database synchronization with new terminology
3. **Begin Extensible Cartography** - Decouple API from visualization this week
4. **Schedule Architectural Review** - Week 3 validation checkpoint
5. **Establish Extended Refactor Timeline** - 12-week plan integration with MVP phases

## üìã **ACTIONABLE ITEMS ANALYSIS**

### **1. COLOR_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT_20250614_133104.md**
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Colors optimized, pending database sync  
**MECEC Classification:** Current - Immediate integration required  
**Integration Issue:** Must be updated with new cartographic terminology (`Anchor`/`Axis` vs legacy well/dipole)

**Reconciliation Actions:**
- [ ] **Database Synchronization:** Update framework color schemes in PostgreSQL with `Anchor`/`Axis` references
- [ ] **Terminology Update:** Replace all color documentation with cartographic lexicon
- [ ] **API Integration:** Ensure `/coordinates` endpoint returns updated colors with `Anchor`/`Axis` terminology
- **Timeline:** Complete by end of Week 2 (June 28)

### **2. ACTIONABLE - discernus_architectural_review_prompt.md**
**Status:** üìã **READY** - Charter prepared, review not executed  
**MECEC Classification:** Current - Critical validation checkpoint  
**Integration Issue:** Should be executed at end of refactor phase for validation

**Reconciliation Actions:**
- [ ] **Schedule Review:** Week 3 (July 1-5) after core refactor completion
- [ ] **Scope Definition:** Focus specifically on terminology/cartography changes
- [ ] **Expert Execution:** Use prepared prompt with Claude-4-Sonnet MAX mode
- **Timeline:** Execute Week 3, integrate findings into extended refactor plan

### **3. ACTIONABLE - discernus_terminology_strategy.md**
**Status:** üìö **COMPLETE STRATEGY** - Lexicon defined, implementation pending  
**MECEC Classification:** Current - Foundation for all refactor work  
**Integration Issue:** Strategy is solid, needs scoped implementation this week

**Reconciliation Actions:**
- [ ] **Core Implementation:** API endpoints and framework configs only (Week 2)
- [ ] **Documentation Update:** README and key onboarding docs (Week 2)
- [ ] **Deprecation Bridge:** Implement alias system for backward compatibility
- **Timeline:** Core changes Week 2, full implementation over 12-week plan

### **4. ACTIONABLE - discernus_extensible_cartography_plan.md**
**Status:** üéØ **STRATEGIC PLAN** - Architecture defined, implementation required  
**MECEC Classification:** Current - Critical for platform extensibility

**Status:** üìÖ **DETAILED TIMELINE** - 12-week implementation plan  
**MECEC Classification:** Current - **TIMELINE CONFLICT IDENTIFIED**  
**Integration Issue:** **CRITICAL:** Plan requires 12 weeks, current iteration allocates 1 week

**Reconciliation Actions:**
- [ ] **Staged Implementation:** Core functionality Week 2, extended plan Weeks 3-14
- [ ] **MVP Integration:** Align 12-week plan with current MVP phases  
- [ ] **Priority Matrix:** Immediate vs deferred refactor components
- **Timeline:** Scoped Week 2, full plan extends through MVP completion

## üö® **CRITICAL TIMELINE CONFLICT RESOLUTION**

### **The Problem**
- **Current Iteration Plan:** "Execute Deep Terminology Refactor" in Week 2 (June 23-28)
- **Implementation Plan:** 12-week detailed timeline (June 22 - September 13)
- **Conflict:** Physical impossibility of completing 12-week plan in 1 week

### **The Solution: Staged Implementation Approach**

#### **Stage 1: Core Refactor (Week 2 - June 23-28)**
**Scope:** Minimal viable cartographic terminology change to unblock academic validation
- ‚úÖ API endpoints: `/coordinates`, `/frameworks`, `/export` return `Anchor`/`Axis` vocabulary
- ‚úÖ Framework YAML files: `well_id`‚Üí`anchor_id`, `dipole_id`‚Üí`axis_id` replacements
- ‚úÖ Core classes: `Anchor`, `Axis`, `AxisSignature`, `AnchorSignature` replace `Well`, `Dipole`
- ‚úÖ Deprecation aliases: Backward compatibility for existing scripts using legacy terms
- ‚úÖ Key documentation: README, terminology strategy, onboarding guides use cartographic lexicon

#### **Stage 2: Extended Refactor (Weeks 3-14)**
**Scope:** Complete systematic refactor per implementation plan
- üìã All codebase variables, functions, comments
- üìã All YAML configurations and templates  
- üìã All documentation and examples
- üìã All test files and fixtures
- üìã All visualization and export systems
- üìã All academic publication materials

#### **Integration Matrix**

| Week | Current MVP Focus | Terminology Stage | Cartography Stage | Status |
|------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| 2 | Core Refactor | Stage 1: API/Framework core | API decoupling, Radar v2 | ‚ö° NEXT WEEK |
| 3 | Demo Development | Architectural review | Adapter SDK | üìã PLANNED |
| 4 | Validation Study | Documentation update | UMAP/Parallel adapters | üìã PLANNED |
| 5-8 | Expert Consultation | Systematic codebase | Plugin registry | üìã PLANNED |
| 9-12 | Statistical Validation | Complete refactor | Full adapter ecosystem | üìã PLANNED |
