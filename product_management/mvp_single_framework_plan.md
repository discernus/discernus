# Discernus Dual Framework MVP Implementation Plan
**Moral Foundations Theory and Political Framing Theory as Comprehensive Proof-of-Concept**

*Date: June 2025*  
*Status: Focused MVP Strategy*  
*Approach: Dual Framework End-to-End Validation*

> **Note on Terminology (June 2025):** This document is pending updates from the cartographic terminology refactor currently underway. Legacy terms are being replaced as follows: `Well`→`Anchor` (fixed reference points), `Dipole`→`Axis` (paired anchor dimensions), `Gravity`→`Discernus Coordinate System`, and framework outputs become `Axis Signatures` (for frameworks like MFT) or `Anchor Signatures` (for frameworks like PFT). Please interpret future implementation references using the new cartographic vocabulary.

This approach provides robust proof-of-concept across both moral psychology and political communication while demonstrating the platform's capability for multi-framework integration.

**Core Strategy**: Prove the concept works excellently with two complementary frameworks that provide comprehensive discourse analysis capabilities  
**Primary Goal**: End-to-end validation of Discernus approach using both Moral Foundations Theory and Political Framing Theory  
**Success Criteria**: Academic publications across both moral psychology and political communication, expert endorsement from both research communities, community adoption across computational social science disciplines

## Risk Mitigation for Dual Framework MVP Approach

### Technical Risks
**Risk**: Dual framework complexity proves too challenging
**Mitigation**: Start with manual validation before full automation, iterative development, fall back to single framework if necessary

**Risk**: MFT or PFT implementation doesn't achieve adequate validity
**Mitigation**: Early expert consultation for both frameworks, multiple validation approaches, pivot readiness

**Risk**: Framework integration challenges
**Mitigation**: Design unified analysis pipeline with framework-specific modules, independent validation paths

### Academic Risks
**Risk**: Dual framework papers insufficient for publication
**Mitigation**: Focus on methodological rigor for both frameworks, expert collaboration across both communities, demonstrate unique value of comparative analysis

**Risk**: Expert collaboration challenges across multiple communities
**Mitigation**: Multiple expert contacts in both research areas, clear value propositions for each community, flexible collaboration terms

**Risk**: Comparative analysis methodology not accepted
**Mitigation**: Validate frameworks independently first, then demonstrate added value of combined analysis

### Platform Risks
**Risk**: Technical infrastructure proves inadequate for dual framework support
**Mitigation**: Address current gaps systematically, focus on core functionality first, use unified architecture

## Conclusion

This dual framework MVP approach establishes Discernus as comprehensive methodological infrastructure while maintaining academic rigor. By proving the concept works excellently with two complementary established frameworks, we create a robust foundation for expansion while generating immediate academic value and community adoption across multiple research communities.

The dual-framework approach addresses the current platform gaps systematically while building credibility through expert collaboration and rigorous validation across both moral psychology and political communication. Success with both MFT and PFT provides comprehensive proof-of-concept for the broader vision while creating sustainable momentum for long-term platform development with broader academic appeal.

The combination of moral foundations analysis (underlying values) and political framing analysis (strategic communication) provides researchers with unprecedented analytical depth, demonstrating Discernus's unique value proposition for computational discourse analysis.

**Next Action**: Begin Phase 1 implementation focusing on getting both MFT and PFT analysis pipelines working end-to-end with current platform infrastructure, leveraging the comprehensive framework development strategy already established for both frameworks.
