# Daily TODO - June 23, 2025
**Status:** 🚀 **ACTIVE** - Week 2 Iteration Launch Day  
**Priority Focus:** Execute staged terminology/cartography refactor per reconciliation plan  
**Reference:** `MECEC_ACTIONABLE_RECONCILIATION_2025_06_22.md`

---

## 🎯 **TOP PRIORITY - Week 2 Iteration Launch**

### **⚡ CRITICAL: Team Alignment on Staged Approach**
- [ ] **📋 Review MECEC Reconciliation Document** - All team leads review reconciliation plan from June 22
- [ ] **🎯 Team Alignment Meeting** - Present staged implementation approach (Core Dev, API, Frontend)
- [ ] **📅 Week 3 Scheduling** - Schedule architectural review for July 1-5
- [ ] **✅ Success Criteria Confirmation** - Confirm revised Week 2 criteria alignment

**Context:** Timeline conflict resolved - 1-week core refactor, 12-week extended plan

## 🚀 **ITERATION KICKOFF ACTIONS**

### **A. Color Optimization Integration** 
**Owner:** API Team | **Dependency:** Terminology Stage 1
- [ ] **🎨 Database Color Sync** - Begin updating framework color schemes in PostgreSQL with new terminology
- [ ] **📋 Color Documentation Update** - Replace well/dipole terms with anchor/axis in color docs
- [ ] **🔗 API Integration Planning** - Plan `/coordinates` endpoint color updates

### **B. Core Terminology Refactor** 
**Owner:** Core Dev Team | **Priority:** Stage 1 Implementation
- [ ] **🏗️ Core Classes Planning** - Design `Anchor`, `Axis`, `AxisSignature`, `AnchorSignature` classes
- [ ] **📊 Framework YAML Analysis** - Assess MFT YAML files for `anchor_id`, `axis_id` conversion
- [ ] **🔗 API Endpoints Planning** - Plan updates for `/coordinates`, `/frameworks`, `/export` with new terms
- [ ] **⚠️ Deprecation Strategy** - Design backward compatibility layer with warnings

### **C. API Decoupling Foundation**
**Owner:** Frontend Team | **Priority:** Cartography Stage 1  
- [ ] **📡 Data-Only Analysis** - Analyze `/coordinates` endpoint for presentation logic removal
- [ ] **🎨 Radar v2 Planning** - Design single reference adapter implementation approach
- [ ] **📚 TypeScript SDK** - Plan adapter interface foundation

## 📊 **PROGRESS TRACKING**

### **Stage 1 Core Refactor (This Week - June 23-28)**
- [ ] API endpoints use new terminology ✅
- [ ] Framework configs converted ✅
- [ ] Core classes implemented ✅
- [ ] Deprecation system active ✅
- [ ] Key documentation updated ✅

### **Academic Validation Readiness**
- [ ] Framework colors synchronized ✅
- [ ] Expert demo materials clean ✅
- [ ] MFT replication package functional ✅

### **Platform Extensibility Foundation**
- [ ] API decoupled from visualization ✅
- [ ] Adapter architecture foundation ✅
- [ ] Plugin system skeleton ✅

---

## 🚨 **RISKS & MITIGATIONS**

### **Today's Specific Risks**
- **Team Alignment Delays** → Start with async document review, focused alignment meeting
- **Complexity Underestimation** → Focus ruthlessly on Stage 1 scope only (core API/framework)
- **Integration Planning Gaps** → Document all dependencies and handoffs clearly

### **Quality Gates for Week**
- [ ] **End-to-End Test** - Full MFT experiment with new terminology
- [ ] **Compatibility Test** - Legacy scripts work with deprecation warnings
- [ ] **API Test** - Data-only responses verified

---

## 📋 **INTEGRATION CHECKLIST**

### **MECEC Compliance Verification**
- [ ] **Mutually Exclusive** - Clear ownership assignments confirmed
- [ ] **Collectively Exhaustive** - All 5 ACTIONABLE items have week 2 actions
- [ ] **Current** - All actions align with iteration timeline (June 23-28)

### **Documentation Updates Required This Week**
- [ ] README terminology updates
- [ ] Iteration plan success criteria updated ✅
- [ ] Key onboarding guide terminology
- [ ] API documentation endpoint changes

---

## 🔄 **END OF DAY DELIVERABLES**

### **Planning Deliverables**
- [ ] Detailed implementation plans for core classes and API changes
- [ ] Database synchronization approach for color updates
- [ ] Deprecation bridge design with backward compatibility strategy
- [ ] Team alignment confirmed on staged approach

### **Process Deliverables**
- [ ] Week 3 architectural review scheduled
- [ ] Extended timeline (Weeks 3-14) integration confirmed
- [ ] Daily progress tracking established for iteration
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies documented

### **Technical Foundation**
- [ ] Core refactor scope clearly defined and bounded
- [ ] API decoupling approach designed
- [ ] Color optimization integration planned with new terminology

---

## 📈 **SUCCESS METRICS**

**Planning:**
- Team aligned on realistic staged timeline
- All 5 ACTIONABLE items have clear week 2 scope
- Extended refactor plan integrated with MVP phases

**Technical:**
- Core refactor foundation planned and scoped
- API decoupling approach designed
