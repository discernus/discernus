# Discernus Ecosystem Strategy Document

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for building, maintaining, and defending the integrity of the Discernus platform as a field-defining, source-available academic infrastructure for persuasive text analysis. The goal is to maximize adoption in the research community while discouraging fragmentation and forking through a combination of legal, technical, social, and epistemic mechanisms.

---

## 1. Licensing and Legal Control

- **Source-Available Academic License**: Custom license that permits free use and modification for academic purposes but restricts commercial use and redistributive branding.
- **Trademark Policy**: Register and enforce the “Discernus” name. Require forks to rebrand unless explicitly approved.
- **Redistribution Terms**: Public redistribution must retain license, naming, and change documentation clauses.
- **No-Name Confusion Clause**: Prevents modified versions from using “Discernus” unless compatibility is certified.

---

## 2. Ecosystem Architecture and Technical Deterrents

- **Plugin-Based Architecture**: Modular core with registration-based extensions (e.g., via decorators or registries).
- **Central Config Schema**: All modules and experiments operate through a single, structured YAML/JSON config system.
- **Hosted Infrastructure Dependence**:
  - Benchmark submission/validation pipeline
  - Model registry and extension hub
- **Rich CLI Integration**: All workflows tied to `discernus` CLI to add friction to forks.
- **Metaprogramming Patterns**: Use decorators and class factories to enforce cross-cutting behaviors.

## 3. GitHub-Based Ecosystem Management

- **One GitHub Organization** (`discernus`):
  - `discernus-core`
  - `discernus-modules/*`
  - `discernus-hub` (static site via GitHub Pages)
- **Extension Metadata**:
  - `discernus.json` or `module.yaml` schema in each repo
- **Module Registry**:
  - Auto-discovered via GitHub API
  - Validated and listed via nightly workflow
- **CI-Based Compatibility Tests**:
  - Modules run against Compatibility Test Kit (CTK) using GitHub Actions
  - Success = badge + listing on hub

---

## 4. Community Incentives

- **Contributor Recognition**:
  - Public contributor boards, badge system
  - GitHub Teams: `@discernus/core`, `@discernus/modules`, `@discernus/steering-board`
- **PR Integration and Response Time**: Contribute upstream as the fastest way to impact
- **Academic Credit Infrastructure**:
  - Citation tracking per module
  - Benchmark performance leaderboard
  - Co-authorship opportunities on whitepapers and reports

---

## 5. Epistemic Authority and Research Integration

- **Whitepapers and Standards**:
  - Discernus-branded publications defining methodology and schemas
  - Software as reference implementation of a normative framework
- **Benchmark-as-Prestige**:
  - Public leaderboards and challenge sets
  - Annual “State of Discernus” report
- **Citation Graph**:
  - Auto-indexed publications using Discernus tools
  - Scholar integration and export formats

---

## 6. Governance and Legitimacy

- **Steering Committee**:
  - Visible academic leadership
  - RFC process for roadmap changes
- **Submission Protocols**:
  - PR templates, issue types, GitHub Discussions for new extensions
- **Open Roadmap and Community RFCs**

---

## 7. Strategic Narrative and Branding

- **Discernus as Infrastructure**: Not just tooling, but foundational to persuasive text research.
- **Forking as Defection**: Frame forks as leaving the standards, benchmarks, and shared legitimacy behind.
- **Storytelling in Docs and Readme**: Articulate the “why” of Discernus—its vision, mission, and field-shaping role.

---

## 8. External Integrations and Partnerships

- **Journal Partnerships**:
  - Compatibility badges and reproducibility tracks
- **Conference Tracks**:
  - Discernus-based awards or demo sessions
- **Optional External Tools**:
  - Algolia for search
  - Netlify for custom UI
  - Discourse or GitHub Discussions for community hub

---

## Conclusion

Discernus is not just a platform—it’s a framework, a community, and a strategic movement. This strategy builds a gravitational center around openness, stewardship, and shared legitimacy. It invites innovation, discourages fragmentation, and sets the terms for what persuasive text analysis becomes.

Forks aren’t blocked—they’re outcompeted.
