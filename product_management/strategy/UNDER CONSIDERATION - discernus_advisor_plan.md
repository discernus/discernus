**Discernus Advisor: Lightweight Cloud Companion for Researcher Onboarding**

---

### Original Concept (User Proposal)

> As a researcher adopting Discernus for the first time, you want to make sure you are specifying your frameworks and experiments and corpus properly. You can read the documentation and try to write compliant YAML files for this and then run them at the CLI on your machine, but every mistake gets flagged by the experiment orchestration engine validation and transaction management system and QA system, sending you back to your YAML files and corpus to try again. These iterations can be a little frustrating, but you know it's important to get things right.
>
> So what if you could connect your local Discernus system to Discernus Advisor, a cloud API that ingests your experiment and framework YAML files and a few samples from your corpus and uses its knowledge of the system to give you feedback in advance of running an experiment. It's a domain-specific LLM that you chat with at the command line in your local Discernus install, and it has a conversation that tries to guide you toward a successful experiment. It can even fix your files for you and put them in your workspace all ready to run.
>
> And then after you run your experiments, you can allow the Discernus Advisor to have access to your results, and it can give you tips and pointers on how to interpret the results and future directions you might take. It's not bossy or opinionated, just a helpful experienced colleague there to help you get the results you are looking for.
>
> On the back end, Discernus Advisor is a client library hooked up to a cloud service backed by one of the flagship LLMs kind of like a custom GPT, but with lots of always updated domain knowledge and constraints to keep the conversation focused on areas it can help with.

### Expert Refinement

#### Strategic Summary
Discernus Advisor is a minimal yet high-leverage cloud companion that accelerates user onboarding by offering real-time feedback, repair suggestions, and post-run guidance via a CLI-integrated LLM service. It builds trust and reduces friction for first-time researchers while laying the groundwork for monetizable cloud offerings.

#### Key Benefits
- Solves a real pain point (YAML/corpus validation loops)
- Lightweight integration with CLI tooling
- Domain-specific LLM with fixed scope and helpful tone
- Repair suggestions + result interpretation
- Sets up the long tail for subscription services

### System Architecture Overview

#### Core Layers
1. **Local CLI Plug-in**: Sends YAML, metadata, and a few corpus snippets
2. **API Gateway**: Auth, rate-limit, logging
3. **Advisor Orchestrator**: FastAPI + LangChain-powered service that handles RAG prompting and response formatting
4. **Vector Store**: pgvector-backed PostgreSQL storing Discernus docs, schemas, and FAQs
5. **LLM Backend**: OpenAI Responses API (or equivalent)
6. **Telemetry Layer**: OpenTelemetry spans, usage metrics, clickstream

### State & Memory Model

#### 1. Ephemeral Session State (Redis)
- Last N user/assistant turns
- Patch diffs
- Auto-expires after inactivity

#### 2. Persistent Workspace State
- Run metadata stored in PostgreSQL
- Corpus + YAML snapshots referenced via hash
- Opt-in result uploads to S3

#### 3. Domain Knowledge Base
- Vector embeddings of framework specs, schemas, examples
- Refreshable via CI pipeline

The orchestrator assembles a prompt per request using:
- Latest user input + session history (Redis)
- Relevant knowledge base chunks (pgvector)
- Current validated metadata (PostgreSQL or passed inline)

---

### Cloud Stack (AWS Reference)

- **API Edge**: Amazon API Gateway + WAF
- **Compute**: AWS Fargate (ECS) with autoscaling
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL with pgvector, S3 for optional artifacts
- **Secrets & Config**: AWS Secrets Manager
- **LLM**: OpenAI Responses API
- **Telemetry**: AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry + CloudWatch
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions → ECR → ECS Blue/Green deploys

Projected infra cost: <$50/month (excluding LLM calls)

### Timeline Estimate

| Phase         | Timeframe | Team Size | Key Outcomes                     |
|---------------|-----------|------------|----------------------------------|
| Spike         | 2 weeks   | 2 ENG      | Happy-path LLM repair demo       |
| MVP Alpha     | 6 weeks   | 2 ENG + 1 DevOps | CLI plug-in + Orchestrator + vector store |
| Beta          | 8 weeks   | 3 ENG + 1 DevOps + 0.5 PM | Auth, usage metering, bug fixes, config UI |
| GA & Monetize | 12 weeks  | 4 ENG + 1 SRE + 1 PM | Tiered plans, Stripe billing, S3 cache, GDPR|

Total LOE: ~90 person-weeks over 4–6 calendar months

### Takeaway
Discernus Advisor is a pragmatic, low-friction, high-leverage service that turns early frustrations into trust. It not only saves researchers time, but earns their long-term cloud engagement by being the expert colleague who gets them unstuck—and then points them forward.
