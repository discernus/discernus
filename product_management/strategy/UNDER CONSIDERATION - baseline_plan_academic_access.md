# Baseline Plan: Academic Use with Source Access

## Overview
The Discernus platform will be freely available for academic researchers under a tailored academic-use license, ensuring broad scholarly access while enabling enterprise monetization through dual licensing and managed services.

---

## Core Platform
- **Deployment Model**: Docker image, CLI and API-driven local or lab environment.
- **Output Formats**: Human-readable, machine-readable, Jupyter notebooks, R, Stata compatible exports.
- **Web UI**: None planned to streamline complexity and minimize overhead.

---

## Licensing Strategy
- **Academic Use License**: Source-available for academic research and non-commercial projects.
- **Dual Licensing**: Commercial enterprises require separate commercial licenses.
- **Trademark & Fork Control**: Implement robust trademark policy and Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to mitigate fork risk and control branding.

---

## Community and Extensions Strategy
- **Platform**: GitHub-hosted.
- **Governance**: Benevolent dictator model per extension/framework owner.
- **Process**: Clear, easy-to-follow guidelines for uploading, developing, and maintaining community extensions.
- **Incentives**: Reputation-building mechanisms, credit for academic contributions, citation facilitation.
