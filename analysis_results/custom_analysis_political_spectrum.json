    "raw_response": "The text suggests a centrist or moderate political perspective. It emphasizes the importance of individual freedom, which is a key principle in right-wing or libertarian ideologies that prioritize personal liberties and limited government intervention. However, it also highlights the need for collective responsibility, a concept often associated with left-wing or socialist ideologies that emphasize community welfare and social responsibility. Therefore, the text seems to advocate for a balanced approach, combining elements from both ends of the political spectrum.",
