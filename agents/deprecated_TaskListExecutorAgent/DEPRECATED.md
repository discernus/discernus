# Deprecation Notice: TaskListExecutorAgent

**Date**: July 24, 2025
**Status**: Deprecated

## Reason for Deprecation

This agent was part of a more complex, multi-step orchestration flow that has been streamlined. It was responsible for taking an interpreted task list and having an LLM execute it, which violated the THIN principle of keeping execution logic deterministic and separate from LLM intelligence.

## Replacement

This agent's functionality is now subsumed by the new, thin **`Execution Bridge`**.

- **Location**: `scripts/execution_bridge.py`
- **Purpose**: The `ExecutionBridge` directly parses the plan from the `OrchestratorAgent` and creates tasks, removing the need for an intermediate task list interpretation step.

This change significantly simplifies the orchestration pipeline and removes unnecessary complexity.
