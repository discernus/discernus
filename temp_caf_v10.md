# Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) v10.0

---

## Part 1: The Scholarly Document

### Section 1: Abstract & *Raison d'Ãªtre*

**What is this framework?**
The Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) provides a systematic approach to evaluating the civic character of political discourse. It analyzes the moral character displayed by speakers, based on Aristotelian virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican theory. The framework evaluates what civic virtues and vices speakers demonstrate through their rhetorical choices, focusing on the fundamental tensions between competing values.

**What problem does it solve?**
Democratic governance depends on civic discourse that embodies fundamental virtues. However, political communication often involves strategic tensions where speakers simultaneously appeal to competing virtues and their pathological counterparts. This framework provides a rigorous methodology for evaluating these tensions and assessing the overall civic character of political discourse. It moves beyond simple sentiment analysis to quantify the moral coherence of a speaker's communication.

**Who is it for?**
This framework is designed for researchers, journalists, educators, and citizens who need to assess the moral fitness and integrity of political leaders. It is applicable to political speeches, debates, interviews, and other forms of public communication where a speaker's character is revealed.

### Section 2: Theoretical & Empirical Foundations

The CAF is grounded in a multi-disciplinary body of research from political philosophy, virtue ethics, and political communication theory.

#### **Aristotelian Virtue Ethics in a Political Context**
Drawing from Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics*, CAF recognizes that excellence in public life depends on the cultivation of specific virtues and the habitual avoidance of corresponding vices. Political leadership requires not merely policy competence but demonstrated moral character worthy of democratic trust. The framework operationalizes this by measuring the observable rhetorical habits of speakers.

**Core Principle**: Character is revealed through choices under pressure. How leaders communicate when facing political challenges reveals their fundamental moral orientation.

#### **Civic Republican Character Theory**
Building on contemporary scholarship by figures like Michael Sandel and Philip Pettit, CAF examines how speakers either embody the civic virtues necessary for democratic leadership or display vices that undermine their fitness for public trust.

**Key Insight**: Democratic governance depends on leaders who prioritize universal principles over narrow interests, demonstrate intellectual integrity, and maintain commitment to democratic norms even when politically costly.

#### **The Importance of Salience Weighting**
A core innovation of the v10 specification is the distinction between a dimension's **intensity** (its raw 0.0-1.0 score) and its **salience** (its rhetorical prominence or emphasis, also 0.0-1.0). This is empirically grounded in research showing that context-dependent weighting based on textual emphasis provides more accurate results than fixed weighting schemes (Laver et al., 2003). By analyzing both intensity and salience, CAF captures not just *what* is being said, but *how much emphasis* it receives, providing a more nuanced and valid assessment.

### Section 3: Analytical Methodology

CAF evaluates political discourse across five bipolar axes that form the foundation of civic character. Each of the ten dimensions is scored independently for both intensity (raw_score) and rhetorical prominence (salience).

**Dimensions & Axes**:

**Identity Axis**: 
-   **Tribalism** (0.0-1.0): Group loyalty over universal principles, us-vs-them framing.
-   **Dignity** (0.0-1.0): Respect for universal human worth, emphasis on shared humanity.

**Truth Axis**:
-   **Manipulation** (0.0-1.0): Strategic distortion of information, emotional manipulation.
-   **Truth** (0.0-1.0): Commitment to factual accuracy, intellectual honesty.

**Justice Axis**:
-   **Resentment** (0.0-1.0): Exploitation of grievances, blame-focused rhetoric.
-   **Justice** (0.0-1.0): Concern for fair outcomes, procedural fairness.

**Emotional Axis**:
-   **Fear** (0.0-1.0): Anxiety-inducing rhetoric, threat-focused language.
-   **Hope** (0.0-1.0): Constructive optimism, positive vision for the future.

**Reality Axis**:
-   **Fantasy** (0.0-1.0): Unrealistic promises, magical thinking, oversimplified solutions.
-   **Pragmatism** (0.0-1.0): Realistic problem-solving, acknowledgment of constraints.

**Interpretive Guidance: Pattern Classifications**
While not calculated as formal metrics, the synthesis agent should be guided by the following interpretive patterns to assess the overall character profile. These patterns emerge from the relationships between dimensional scores and salience.
- **Authentic Virtue**: High scores and high salience for virtue dimensions, indicating a genuine commitment to civic ideals.
- **Strategic Virtue Signaling**: High scores but low salience for virtue dimensions, suggesting superficial appeals without substantive commitment.
- **Strategic Pathology**: High scores and high salience for vice dimensions, indicating a deliberate deployment of divisive or manipulative rhetoric.
- **Incoherent Messaging**: High tension scores between opposing dimensions, indicating inconsistent or contradictory value appeals.

**Derived & Composite Metrics**:

**Character Tension Indices** (0.0-1.0, higher = more contradiction):
These metrics, restored from CAF v5.0, quantify the strategic contradictions in a speaker's rhetoric. They are now salience-weighted to reflect the prominence of the competing appeals.
- **Formula**: `Tension = min(Virtue_Score, Vice_Score) * abs(Virtue_Salience - Vice_Salience)`
- **Indices**: `identity_tension`, `truth_tension`, `justice_tension`, `emotional_tension`, `reality_tension`.

**Salience-Weighted Civic Character Index** (-1.0 to +1.0, negative = vice-dominant, positive = virtue-dominant):
This is the primary summary metric, calculating the overall character orientation of the discourse. It weights each dimension by its rhetorical prominence.
- **Formula**: The sum of all (Virtue Score * Virtue Salience) minus the sum of all (Vice Score * Vice Salience), normalized by the total salience of all dimensions. This ensures that the most emphasized themes have the greatest impact on the final character assessment.

### Section 4: Intended Application & Corpus Fit

-   **Target Corpus Description**: CAF is designed for the analysis of persuasive or strategic communication where a speaker's character is a central element, such as political speeches, candidate debates, and public statements.
-   **Known Limitations & Scope**: The framework is less suited for analyzing purely informational texts, policy documents, or artistic works. It requires a text where a speaker is actively making choices that reveal their moral and civic orientation.
-   **Model Requirements**: This framework requires a highly capable LLM model (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) for reliable analysis due to the nuanced distinctions between dimensions and the dual-track intensity/salience scoring.

    analysis_prompt: |
      You are an expert analyst of civic character and political ethics, grounded in Aristotelian virtue ethics and civic republican theory. Your task is to analyze the provided text using the Civic Analysis Framework v10.0.

      FRAMEWORK METHODOLOGY:
      This framework evaluates civic virtues and vices speakers demonstrate through rhetorical choices. It preserves complexity by independently scoring opposing dimensions for both intensity (raw_score) and rhetorical prominence (salience).

      DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS:
      You must evaluate 10 dimensions across 5 opposing pairs:
      - Identity: Tribalism vs. Dignity
      - Truth: Manipulation vs. Truth
      - Justice: Resentment vs. Justice
      - Emotional: Fear vs. Hope
      - Reality: Fantasy vs. Pragmatism

      EVIDENCE STANDARDS:
      - Provide exact quotations, not paraphrases.
      - Prioritize direct rhetorical indicators over interpretive inferences.
      - If evidence is ambiguous, lower the confidence score.

      SALIENCE ASSESSMENT: 
      Salience measures rhetorical prominence. Consider frequency, structural positioning (openings/closings), and thematic centrality. SALIENCE is not the same as INTENSITY.
