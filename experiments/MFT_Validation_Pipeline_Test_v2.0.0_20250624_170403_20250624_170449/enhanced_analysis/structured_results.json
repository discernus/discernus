Thank you for coming here on this beautiful Arizona evening. [Applause] \n\nMy friends, we have come to the end of a long journey. The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling Senator Barack Obama to congratulate him - please - to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love.\n\nIn a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.\n\nThis is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight. I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. Senator Obama believes that too. But we both recognize that though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound.\n\nA century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt's invitation of Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House was taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than the election of an African-American to the presidency of the United States. [Applause]\n\nLet there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth. Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day, though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her Creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise.\n\nSenator Obama and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.\n\nI urge all Americans - I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.\n\nWhatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that. [Applause]\n\nIt is natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but tomorrow we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought - we fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.\n\nI am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset, but your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you.\n\nI'm especially grateful to my wife Cindy, my children, my dear mother, and all my family, and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a fortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me.\n\nYou know, campaigns are often harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's been true in this campaign. All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude and the promise of more peaceful years ahead.\n\nI am also, of course, very thankful to Governor Sarah Palin - one of the best campaigners I have ever seen and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength. Her husband Todd and their five beautiful children, for their tireless dedication to our cause and the courage and grace they showed in the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to Alaska, the Republican Party, and our country.\n\nTo all my campaign comrades, from Rick Davis and Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly month after month in what at times seemed to be the most challenging campaign in modern times - thank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship.\n\nI don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave that to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm sure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been.\n\nThis campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life, and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that Senator Obama and my old friend Senator Joe Biden should have the honor of leading us for the next four years.\n\n[Please, please] I would not be an American worthy of the name should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century. Today I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much, and tonight I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people of Arizona for it.\n\nTonight - tonight more than any night - I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or Senator Obama. I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president, and I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America.\n\nBecause nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.\n\nThank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all very much.\n\n[Applause]\n\n=== larry_hogan_2023_giia_infrastructure_speech.txt ===\nTITLE: US Infrastructure Champion Governor Larry Hogan Addresses GIIA Board Members\nSPEAKER: Larry Hogan\nROLE: Former Governor of Maryland, Former Chairman of National Governors Association  \nDATE: December 2023\nVENUE: Global Infrastructure Investor Association Board Meeting\nSOURCE: Global Infrastructure Investor Association\nURL: https://giia.net/news/us-infrastructure-champion-governor-larry-hogan-addresses-giia-board-members\nCLASSIFICATION: Conservative Dignity\nFRAMEWORK_QUADRANT: Conservative/Dignity\nVALIDATION_STUDY: Civic Virtue Framework - Dignity vs Tribalism Dimension\nEXTRACTED: December 2024\n\n===== SPEECH CONTENT =====\n\n\"Modernizing America's infrastructure won't happen without modernizing the way we finance infrastructure.\"\n\nSince the passage of the bipartisan Infrastructure Bill and the Inflation Reduction act, the time to invest in American infrastructure projects, in my opinion, has never been better. And I'm hopeful that many of the successes that we've already achieved together are just the beginning of a public private partnership revolution in the United States.\n\nIt's about time that we brought the United States in line with the rest of the world.\n\nWhen we took office, our roads and bricks were crumbling. We launched an infrastructure initiative all across the state, taking a balanced, all-inclusive approach to infrastructure investment. I'm proud that we made Maryland into both a national and an international leader, in using innovative solutions to address pressing infrastructure concerns. We moved forward on nearly all of our state's highest priority transportation projects in every single jurisdiction.\n\nAll across our state we made record investments in roads, bridges, tunnels, transit systems, ports and airports. We replaced and repaired every structurally deficient bridge. We resurfaced nearly 100% of the entire state highway system.\n\nAs one of the first governors of America to embrace P3s for infrastructure, one thing that we realized was that both state, and particularly local issues and interests, often created more of a headache for investments than national politics did. Many times we found that having partners who knew how to navigate state local government entities were some of the most valuable allies in trying to get large infrastructure projects approved.\n\nSo we incorporated state and local advisors into the working group that could anticipate concerns raised by hyper local interests, that could easily derail or delay projects. After a year-long effort, I got all 50 governors to agree on a series of recommendations, including four main pillars.\n\nFirst was to relieve congestion to boost economic competitiveness. We insisted that the states be granted maximum flexibility to relieve congestion and to invest in adaptable and innovative solutions.\n\nSecond, enhancing efficiency by eliminating red tape and integrating smart technology. We pushed for a two-year goal for completion of environmental reviews and a 90-day timeline for related project authorizations.\n\nThird, we focused on protecting America's critical infrastructure against not only traditional threats, but also emerging cyber threats. We recommended that Congress make investments in both resiliency and security.\n\nAnd fourth, and in my opinion the most important and most impactful, was to advocate for the financing of infrastructure projects through private sector investment.\n\nWe stressed that states needed maximum flexibility to harness the full potential of the private sector to be a part of America's infrastructure future and through P3s. Government - whether federal, state or local - simply cannot afford what it will take to address all the gaps that exist in our collective investment in American infrastructure.\n\nEach of these pillars and nearly all of our recommendations were included in the final Infrastructure Bill, which passed through Congress with bipartisan support.\n\nOften times, when I was NGA Chairman, I would meet with governors across the country, both Republicans and Democrats, who frankly knew very little about private financing for infrastructure. It's important for potential investors to know that some of the biggest decision makers in America are often times state and local politicians and bureaucrats, who are still not yet sold on the benefits of P3s and infrastructure financing.\n\nI still believe that America's best days are ahead, and we have shown the path to modernizing America's infrastructure. It starts with modernizing the way we finance our infrastructure projects. America is a country that was founded on innovative solutions and a spirit of optimism. I firmly believe that what we've started together is blazing a trail for others to follow.\n\nNow it's time for us to just get the rest of America on board.\n\nState, local governments and the federal government are not going to be able to accomplish all the things, no matter how much money they try to invest. They're finding they're running out of funds. People are tightening their belts rather than investing more in some cases, which is all the more reason why we need to tap into the vast amount of private sector money that's willing to invest in infrastructure.\n\nThe last thing any politician, whether they're progressive, Democrat or conservative, probably wants to do is raise taxes. And when they have revenue shortfalls and increasing expenditures and capital needs, I think there's never going to be an easier time to persuade them that, hey, we have a solution.\n\n=== mitt_romney_2020_impeachment_vote.txt ===\n**Mitt Romney - Senate Floor Speech on Impeachment Vote**\n\n**Bibliographic Information:**\n- **Speaker:** Mitt Romney, U.S. Senator from Utah\n- **Event:** Senate Impeachment Trial of President Donald Trump\n- **Speech Type:** Impeachment Vote Explanation\n- **Date:** February 5, 2020\n- **Location:** U.S. Senate Chamber, Washington, D.C.\n- **Context:** Speech explaining his vote to convict President Trump on abuse of power charges\n- **Source:** C-SPAN (YouTube Archive)\n- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wf9ilAfJ-c\n- **Duration:** 8 minutes 30 seconds\n- **Views:** Over 60,000\n- **Classification:** Conservative Dignity (Validation Set)\n- **Historical Significance:** Romney became the first senator in U.S. history to vote to convict a president of his own party, demonstrating constitutional principle over partisan loyalty. A defining moment of conservative conscience and institutional integrity.\n\n---\n\nMr. President, Senator from Utah. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it. The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\n\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, the Bidens' conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\n\nThe president's counsel also notes that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor general. If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.\n\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \"stand with the team.\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\n\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\n\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n=== rick_perry_2016_alec_speech.txt ===\nTitle: Remarks by Governor Rick Perry at the American Legislative Exchange Council Annual Meeting\nSpeaker: Governor Rick Perry\nDate: August 4, 2016\nEvent: American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) Annual Meeting\nLocation: United States (location not specified)\nSource: YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T_ZQtxlWxs\nChannel: American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)\nDuration: 39 minutes 47 seconds\nHistorical Significance: Governor Perr's comprehensive address on conservative approaches to criminal justice reform and racial justice, arguing for how Republicans can better serve African American communities through policy reform rather than rhetoric. Notable for its frank discussion of historical racial injustice and concrete policy prescriptions on criminal justice reform, education, and economic opportunity.\n\n---\n\nI want to spend some time with you today talking about the most pressing issue of our time for people like you and me, for people who share our values, for people all across this state and across this country.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not the election. Though believe me, I have opinions about that too. But it\u2019s about something that is affecting this election, and will affect much more than this election if we don\u2019t do something about it.\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan left office in 1989, America knew\u2014and the world knew\u2014the value of individual liberty and limited government. Whether you lived in East Berlin, Germany or East Bernard, Texas\u2014whether you were a multi-generation Texan or an immigrant from Vietnam\u2014you knew that conservative principles would make your life better, and those of the people around you.\n\nBut most Americans in their twenties weren\u2019t even alive when Ronald Reagan was President. The reason we\u2019ve had the political year we\u2019ve had is because fewer Americans remember how well liberty can serve them and their families.\n\nAs everyone here at ALEC knows, the conservative movement is thriving in dozens of states, including my beloved Texas. But at the national level\u2014at the level of the electoral college\u2014we\u2019re losing. We can blame bad politicians all we want for that fact. We can blame the media for always stacking the deck against us.\n\nBut here is a truth that we in this room have to confront: Winners don\u2019t make excuses. We haven\u2019t done enough to show people who don\u2019t share our views why they should come over to our side.\n\nWe conservatives are really good at talking to each other about what\u2019s wrong. We\u2019re really good at preaching to the converted. But we\u2019re not so good at reaching out to those who disagree, and winning them over.\n\nForbes Daily: Join over 1 million Forbes Daily subscribers and get our best stories, exclusive reporting and essential analysis of the day\u2019s news in your inbox every weekday.\n\nGet the latest news on special offers, product updates and content suggestions from Forbes and its affiliates.\n\nDuring my 14 years as Governor of Texas, we did a lot of good things. We passed historic tax relief. And I was proud to sign balanced budgets for each of those 14 years. The economic growth that followed helped every Texan, rich or poor. Texas companies created almost one-third of all new American jobs. Texas now leads the nation in exports.\n\nTexas\u2019 high school graduation rate went from 27th in the country in 2003, to 2nd in the country in 2013. Our most recent graduation rate for African-Americans is number one in the nation: 13 points higher than the national average. That matters, because kids who graduate from high school typically make 50 percent more than those who don\u2019t.\n\nThe record is clear. Our policies have made life better for all Texans: those at the top, and those at the bottom. So why is it that our movement continues to do so poorly with minorities? In the 2014 Texas governor\u2019s race, my good friend Greg Abbott crushed Wendy Davis. But Wendy Davis won the black vote 93 to 7.\n\nAgain, we can blame the left. We can blame political correctness. We can blame those who gin up resentment, who find grievance at every turn.\n\nI have an alternative explanation. But first, I have to tell you a story of something that happened one hundred years and two months ago, at a courthouse in McLennan County, Texas.\n\nJesse Washington\u2019s story\n\nOn May 15, 1916, in Waco, a mentally disabled 17-year-old boy named Jesse Washington was convicted of raping and murdering the wife of his employer.\n\nHe pled guilty and was sentenced to death. But Jesse died no ordinary death\u2014because he was black.\n\nAfter the death sentence was issued, Jesse was dragged out of the McLennan County Courthouse and into a crowd of hundreds.\n\nThanks to the advent of a new technology called the telephone, word quickly spread as to what was about to happen\u2026and soon 15,000 people were watching Jesse Washington be tortured, mutilated, and tied over the branch of a tree.\n\nSomeone lit a fire under Jesse, and raised him up into the air.\n\nJesse tried to climb up the chains to avoid the fire.\n\nSomeone started cutting off Jesse\u2019s fingers, so he couldn\u2019t keep climbing.\n\nOne man castrated him, while another used a pole to prevent Jesse from escaping the fire.\n\nA prominent local photographer took pictures of Jesse\u2019s charred remains and sold them: as souvenirs, on postcards.\n\nProgress and pitfalls\n\nWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress since 1916.\n\nA half-century ago, Republicans and Democrats came together to finally enshrine in law the principle that all of us\u2014regardless of race, color, or national origin\u2014are created equal.\n\nWhen it comes to race, America is a better and more tolerant and more welcoming place than it has ever been. We are a country with Hispanic CEOs, and Asian billionaires, and a black President.\n\nThat\u2019s why the story of Ericka Jean Dockery is so troubling.\n\nEricka was a single mother of three who worked two jobs to support her children: during the days as a home health aide, and at nights making sandwiches at Subway. In April 2003, she was hauled before a grand jury, because her boyfriend, Alfred Dewayne Brown, had been suspected of murdering a police officer during a burglary.\n\nEricka told the grand jury that Alfred couldn\u2019t have committed the murder, because he was asleep on her couch on the morning of the murder, and had even called her from the landline phone in her home. \u201cIf he did it,\u201d she said, \u201che deserves to get whatever is coming to him. Truly.\u201d\n\nBut neither the prosecutor nor the grand jury would accept her explanation. They threatened to separate her from her children if she didn\u2019t turn her boyfriend in. \u201cYou know,\u201d said the foreman, \u201cthe kids are going to be taken by Child Protective Services, and you\u2019re going to the penitentiary and you won\u2019t see your kids for a long time.\u201d\n\nEventually, Ericka told a different story\u2014that she had left her house earlier that night, and that she wasn\u2019t sure if Alfred had been on her couch at the time of the murder.\n\nThe Harris County prosecutor, Dan Rizzo, decided to charge Ericka with perjury, and locked her up for four months in the county jail, away from her young children. Rizzo told her that they would only release her from jail if she said definitively that her boyfriend hadn\u2019t been in her home. Ericka, distraught over being away from her kids, said that Alfred had admitted to her that he had murdered the police officer.\n\nIn exchange for this testimony, the prosecutors released Ericka from jail, on the condition that she wear an ankle monitor, and call a homicide detective once a week. At Alfred\u2019s trial in 2005, she testified that Alfred had told her that he \u201cwas there\u201d when the police officer was murdered.\n\nAlfred Dwayne Brown was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.\n\nSeven years after Alfred\u2019s conviction, a reporter for the Houston Chronicle reported that Ericka\u2019s phone records were found in the garage of a homicide detective, indicating that Alfred had indeed called Ericka from her apartment phone at the time of the murder, confirming her initial story. For reasons unknown, the prosecution never made those records available during Alfred\u2019s trial.\n\nAfter a delay of more than a year, the judge in the case agreed to a new trial. In 2015, Alfred was released from death row.\n\nYou could say this story has a happy ending, because Alfred was released. But his life was almost ruined because of an overzealous prosecutor who concealed exonerating evidence. And Ericka\u2019s children were put in harm\u2019s way because of a grand jury that acted as the arm of the prosecution, rather than as an independent check on government power.\n\nSometimes we forget that the IRS isn\u2019t the only government agency capable of abusing its authority. Anyone wielding the power of the state faces the temptation to abuse it. And when it comes to prosecutors, there are clearly bad apples in the system who care more about indicting someone\u2014anyone\u2014than they care about convicting the right person.\n\nYou may know that I was indicted in 2014 on two frivolous felony charges. Eventually, those charges were dismissed, because I was lucky enough to have high-powered lawyers working for me.\n\nEricka Jean Dockery had no such luxury. When ambitious prosecutors go overboard, the true victims aren\u2019t people like you or me: they\u2019re people like Ericka and Alfred who don\u2019t have the means to fight back.\n\nAfrican-Americans lack confidence in our justice system\n\nI hope these stories help explain why even today, so many African-Americans lack confidence in the fairness of our justice system.\n\nAnd, by the way, African-Americans don\u2019t just struggle in our courts.\n\nAfter two decades of declining violent crimes in our cities, we\u2019re losing ground. According to a study by the Washington Post, homicides in our fifty largest cities are up 17 percent in the last year: the largest increase in a quarter century.\n\nA quarter of African-Americans live below the poverty line\u2026even after the impact of federal programs like food stamps and housing subsidies. The supplemental poverty rate for African-Americans is nearly double the rate for other Americans.\n\nDemocrats have long had the opportunity to govern in African-American communities.\n\nIt is time to help black families hold them accountable for the results.\n\nI am here to tell you that it is Republicans\u2014not Democrats\u2014who are truly offering black Americans the hope of a better life for themselves and their children.\n\nWhere Democrats govern, blacks are falling further behind\n\nI am proud to live in a country with an African-American President.\n\nBut President Obama cannot be proud of his record on improving black lives.\n\nEarlier this month, the President spoke at a memorial service for the five police officers gunned down in Dallas. As families and friends mourned, the President said that we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that, quote, \u201ctensions boil over,\u201d because we don\u2019t spend enough on government programs. The President blamed you\u2014and all other Americans\u2014for \u201callow[ing] poverty to fester\u201d in urban communities. The President couldn\u2019t resist injecting a political lecture into a moment that should have been apart from politics.\n\nBut that day in Dallas, the President showed us something else, something worse: that if he and Hillary Clinton get their way, African-Americans will be worse off than they are today.\n\nOverwhelmingly, the cities where the left-wing solutions have been tried over and over again\u2014places like Detroit and Chicago and Baltimore\u2014African-Americans are falling further behind.\n\nIn 2010, President Obama enacted the largest expansion of the welfare state in 50 years. And yet, the prevalence of black poverty has actually increased under his leadership.\n\nWe cannot dismiss the historical legacy of slavery\u2014nor its role in causing the problem of black poverty.\n\nAnd because slavery and segregation were sanctioned by government, there is a role for government policy in addressing their lasting effects.\n\nBut the specific policies enacted by President Obama and advanced by Hillary Clinton amount to little more than throwing money at the problem and walking away.\n\nWe spend $450 billion a year on Medicaid, and yet health outcomes for those on Medicaid are no better than for those with no insurance at all. Instead of reforming Medicaid, the President expanded it under Obamacare.\n\nMr. President, I say with the greatest respect: It is you who has allowed poverty to fester in the African-American community. It is you who has trapped black children in failing schools. And it is you who has made African-Americans less safe.\n\nPolice bias is a real problem\n\nThe President\u2014and the Black Lives Matter movement he supports\u2014never acknowledge the incredible gains achieved by the police on behalf of African-Americans.\n\nThanks to leaders like Rudy Giuliani and Ray Kelly in New York, thousands of blacks are not killed by criminals each year. Those black lives matter too.\n\nBut we cannot dismiss the experience of men like my good friend Senator Tim Scott, who said the other day that he \u201cdid not know many African American men who do not have a\u2026story to tell, no matter the profession, no matter their income, no matter their disposition in life,\u201d of being stopped by a police officer while doing nothing wrong.\n\nThose of us who aren\u2019t black are sometimes too quick to dismiss these complaints. And given America\u2019s dark history of inequality before the law, it is understandable that African-Americans care passionately about having confidence in our system of laws, and the fairness by which they\u2019re enforced.\n\nShedrick Willis was a slave who, before the Civil War, had been bought and sold on the steps of the McLennan County Courthouse, the very place where 17-year-old Jesse Washington was dragged to his death.\n\nWhen I was governor of Texas, I had the honor of appointing Willis\u2019 great-great-great-grandson\u2014Wallace Jefferson\u2014to be the first African-American on the Supreme Court of Texas.\n\nIn 2004, I appointed Wallace to be the Supreme Court\u2019s first black Chief Justice.\n\nTexas has made a real difference for African-Americans\n\nIn Texas, we\u2019ve made a real difference in the lives of African-American families.\n\nWe haven\u2019t eliminated black poverty in Texas. But neither have we allowed it to fester.\n\nIn New York, the supplemental poverty rate for blacks is 26 percent. In California, it\u2019s 30 percent. In Washington, D.C., it\u2019s 33 percent.\n\nIn Texas, it\u2019s just 20 percent.\n\nIn 2014, Texas had its lowest crime rate since 1968. And the improvements keep coming. Last year, while crime rates rose in other states, we saw them decrease by 5 percent in Houston, 5 percent in San Antonio, 5 percent in Dallas, 8 percent in Fort Worth, and 10 percent in Austin.\n\nThe record is clear. So why is it that our movement fails to gain black support?\n\nAs I said earlier, we can blame political correctness. We can blame those who gin up resentment, who find grievance at every turn. But Republicans have much to do to earn the trust of African-Americans.\n\nThere is a legitimate federal role in civil rights\n\nBlacks know that Republican Barry Goldwater, in 1964, ran against Lyndon Johnson, a champion of civil rights.\n\nThey know that Barry Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, because he felt parts of it were unconstitutional.\n\nStates supporting segregation in the South cited \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d as a justification for keeping blacks from the voting booth and the dinner table.\n\nAs you know, I am an ardent believer in the Tenth Amendment, which was ratified in 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights.\n\nThe Tenth Amendment says that \u201cthe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\u201d\n\nI know that state governments are more accountable to you than the federal government is.\n\nBut I am also an ardent believer in the Fourteenth Amendment, which says that no state shall \u201cdeny to any jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d\n\nThere has been\u2014and will continue to be\u2014an important and legitimate role for the federal government in enforcing civil rights.\n\nToo often, we Republicans\u2014myself included\u2014have emphasized our message on the Tenth Amendment but not our message on the Fourteenth: an Amendment, it bears reminding, that was one of the first great contributions of the Republican Party to American life, second only to the abolition of slavery.\n\nFor too long, we Republicans have been content to lose the black vote, because we found that we could win elections without it.\n\nBut when we gave up on trying to win the support of African-Americans, we lost our moral legitimacy as the party of Lincoln, as the party of equal opportunity for all.\n\nIt is time for us to once again reclaim our heritage as the only party in our country founded on the principle of freedom for African-Americans.\n\nCriminal justice reform\n\nOne of the most important things we did in Texas while I was governor was reform our sentencing laws, so that non-violent offenders could stay out of prison.\n\nWe can do more. And we can do it while keeping our low-income communities safe from crime.\n\nLast year, we abolished the \u201cpick a pal\u201d system, which effectively allowed prosecutors to put their friends and neighbors on grand juries for the purpose of predetermining their outcome. I signed into law the Michael Morton Act, which allowed the defense to review the prosecution\u2019s evidence before trial.\n\nNew York and Colorado recently enacted laws that allow defense attorneys some access to the grand jury room, the production of witness transcripts, and advance notice for witnesses, so they have time to retain counsel.\n\nWe should strengthen the capacity of bar associations to discipline prosecutors who intentionally mislead grand juries and hide exculpatory evidence. And victims of prosecutorial abuse should be able to receive compensation for their suffering.\n\nAs Texans got smarter about policing and crime prevention, we came to appreciate the importance of keeping promising young people out of jail.\n\nWe are working to stop the inter-generational cycle of incarceration, where grandchildren meet their grandparents behind prison bars. In 2006, around 5,000 Texan kids were locked up. Today, it\u2019s closer to 1,000.\n\nIn 1990, a teenager named Tyrone Brown failed a marijuana test while he was on probation. For that single violation, he was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nIn 2007, I granted Tyrone a conditional pardon. But half of all prison admissions come from people whose parole or probation has been revoked.\n\nSo we shifted money away from building more prisons, toward specialized drug courts and programs that could help those in prison succeed on parole.\n\nThe best welfare program in America is a job\n\nPresident Obama and Secretary Clinton say that the best way to reduce crime is through more welfare. But here is what I have seen in my time in public service: the best welfare program in America is a job.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to get a job if you have a criminal conviction on your record. And that\u2019s why criminal justice reform is so important.\n\nBut there\u2019s an even bigger reason why Democratic policies have failed to cure poverty: It\u2019s because the only true cure for poverty is a job. And Democratic policies have made it too hard for the poor to find work.\n\nMany poor Americans want to leave welfare and rejoin the workforce.\n\nBut because of taxes and regulations, it often makes more economic sense to stay on welfare than to get a full-time job.\n\nFurthermore, federal programs impose a one-size-fits-all approach to fighting poverty.\n\nIn California, someone might need more money to deal with the cost of housing.\n\nIn Massachusetts, it might be the cost of vocational school.\n\nInstead, we force the poor to enroll in separate programs for housing assistance or Pell grants.\n\nCongress should pass a welfare reform bill that will take the money we already spend on non-health care-related, anti-poverty programs and split it into two parts.\n\nThe first part should be an expanded and reformed version of the Earned Income Tax Credit, so that anyone with a job can live above the poverty line.\n\nThe second part should consist of a block grant, so that states can care for their safety net populations in the manner that best serves their residents.\n\nThe exorbitant price of a college education\n\nWe all know we have to improve our schools.\n\nThis is an area where President Obama had potential. But he caved into the demands of labor unions.\n\nIt\u2019s a fallacy to assume that the vastly different student populations across the country can be adequately educated with one-size-fits-all policies.\n\nWe need to empower state lawmakers, school boards and parents to implement policies that address the specific needs of their students, and keep schools accountable and efficient.\n\nEnterprising charter school teachers\u2014like Eva Moskowitz in New York\u2014should be able to replicate their astounding success all over the country, without the interference of the federal government.\n\nAnd we have to tackle the exorbitant price of a college education.\n\nOne of the biggest barriers today to entering the middle class\u2014black or otherwise\u2014is the high cost of a college degree.\n\nA four-year degree at the typical private college now costs more than $170,000. Compare that to the median home price in America, of $205,000.\n\nWe are literally asking poor students to mortgage their future in order to gain a college degree.\n\nThis must end. In Texas, I challenged our state universities to offer a four-year college degree for less than $10,000.\n\nMany thought it would be impossible to drive tuition and fees that low. But today, 13 Texas universities have reached that target.\n\nWe are on the cusp of an online revolution in higher education. But only if the federal government rolls back the rules that make it almost impossible for students to gain accredited bachelor\u2019s degrees achieved with online instruction.\n\nTackle the high cost of living\n\nFurthermore, just as with college tuition, we have to reduce the cost of living for those who need every dollar to be stretched as far is it can go.\n\nRegulations like minimum wage hikes and Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate drive up the cost of hiring new workers.\n\nThat means that companies hire fewer people.\n\nBut it also means that the price of basic consumer goods goes up.\n\nEarlier this year, the Competitive Enterprise Institute estimated that federal regulations cost American businesses as much as $1.9 trillion a year.\n\nThat\u2019s nearly $15,000 per U.S. household. If you add in state regulations, the problem gets even worse.\n\nIf we, as state and local lawmakers, do these five things:\n\nkeep non-violent offenders out of prison\u2026\nlift barriers to urban jobs\u2026\nincentivize work\u2026\nreform our schools\u2026\nand reduce the cost of living\u2026\nWe will have done more for African-Americans than the last three Democratic Administrations combined.\n\nWe can leave America better than we found it\n\nAt the American Cemetery in Normandy, nine thousand three hundred and eighty-seven American soldiers are buried in orderly row upon orderly row.\n\n\u201cIf ever proof were needed that we fought for a cause and not for conquest,\u201d a general once said, \u201cit could be found in these cemeteries. Here was our only conquest: all we asked was enough soil in which to bury our gallant dead.\u201d\n\nSome of our gallant dead were the sons of Presidents, like Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.\n\nMost were ordinary Americans, simply doing what their country asked of them.\n\nSome of the graves don\u2019t even have names\u2014they\u2019re simply marked: \u201cHere rests in honored glory a comrade in arms known but to God.\u201d\n\nSome of the most compelling graves at Normandy are for African-Americans who served in segregated regiments, like Willie Collins of the 490th Port Battalion.\n\nWillie Collins made the ultimate sacrifice for America, despite the fact that America didn\u2019t always treat him in the way he deserved.\n\nBrigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. and Sergeant Willie Collins grew up in different circumstances.\n\nTed\u2019s ancestors had a coat of arms. Willie\u2019s ancestors were brought here in chains.\n\nBut Ted and Willie joined themselves together with a commitment that every generation of Americans has embraced: the promise of leaving America and the world a better place than they found it\u2026of ensuring a better future for the children and grandchildren of those to come.\n\nI am a beneficiary of the sacrifices of Sergeant Collins and General Roosevelt, and of so many others known but to God.\n\nI grew up in a place called Paint Creek.\n\nWhen I was young, we had an outhouse and mom bathed us on the back porch in a number two washtub.\n\nWe attended the Paint Creek Rural School, where some of the teachers lived on campus.\n\nTheir profession was literally their life, and they inspired me. I can assure you none of my teachers knew they were instructing a future Air Force pilot, let alone a future governor.\n\nBut they also have a motto at the Paint Creek School that summarizes the endless possibilities for its students: \u201cNo dream too tall for a school so small.\u201d\n\nMany people don\u2019t feel that their lives are filled with endless possibilities anymore.\n\nAmericans entering adulthood today have good reason to fear that it will be harder for them to earn a living\u2014to buy a home\u2014to pay off their debts\u2014than it was for their parents.\n\nBut if there is one thing we can learn from Willie Collins and the millions like him\u2014from the tragedy of Jesse Washington and the triumph of Wallace Jefferson\u2014it\u2019s that America has overcome far greater obstacles than the ones we face today.\n\nWillie Collins died in the belief that America could become a better country than the one he left home to serve. And he was right.\n\nIt\u2019s up to us to be worthy of the country that Willie Collins\u2019 generation gave us.\n\nIt\u2019s up to us to leave our country better off than we found it.\n\nAmerica has never been perfect\u2014no country composed of imperfect beings ever could be.\n\nBut there is no country that has achieved more than the United States of America.\n\nWith new leadership and durable reforms, America can be freer and stronger than it has ever been.\n\nAmerica can be that exceptional place, where nothing in life is guaranteed, but where we have restored the faith of all Americans of all colors and creeds in the power of liberty and the equality of justice.\n\nWhere we all have the opportunity to build a better life for ourselves and our children and their children.\n\nThank you\u2014and may God bless America.\n\n=== ronald_reagan_1986_challenger_address.txt ===\n**Ronald Reagan - Address to the Nation on the Challenger Disaster**\n\n**Bibliographic Information:**\n- **Speaker:** Ronald Reagan, 40th President of the United States\n- **Event:** Address to the Nation on the Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster\n- **Speech Type:** National Tragedy Address\n- **Date:** January 28, 1986\n- **Location:** Oval Office, The White House\n- **Context:** Address delivered on the evening of the Challenger disaster, replacing the planned State of the Union address\n- **Source:** C-SPAN (YouTube Archive)\n- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66mGwws7EEw\n- **Duration:** 4 minutes 22 seconds\n- **Views:** Over 222,000\n- **Classification:** Conservative Dignity (Validation Set)\n- **Historical Significance:** One of the most moving presidential addresses in American history, providing comfort to a grieving nation and demonstrating presidential leadership during national tragedy. Features the iconic closing line from John Gillespie Magee Jr.'s poem \"High Flight.\"\n\n---\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the State of the Union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans.\n\nToday is a day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss.\n\nNineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground. But we've never lost an astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle. But they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly.\n\nWe mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn their loss as a nation together.\n\nFor the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, \"Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy.\" They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve, and they did. They served all of us.\n\nWe've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for twenty-five years, the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.\n\nAnd I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them.\n\nI've always had great faith in and respect for our space program, and what happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our space program. We don't keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in public. That's the way freedom is, and we wouldn't change it for a minute.\n\nWe'll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.\n\nI want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA or who worked on this mission and tell them: \"Your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your anguish. We share it.\"\n\nThere's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, \"He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it.\" Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake's, complete.\n\nThe crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and \"slipped the surly bonds of earth\" to \"touch the face of God.\"\n\nThank you.\n\n=== tillis_coons_2017_criminal_justice_reform.txt ===\nTITLE: America's Criminal Justice System Is Broken\nSPEAKERS: Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Chris Coons (D-DE)\nROLES: U.S. Senators, Members of Senate Judiciary Committee\nDATE: January 9, 2017\nVENUE: CNN Op-Ed\nSOURCE: CNN.com / BladenOnline.com\nURL: https://bladenonline.com/tilliscoons-op-ed-americas-criminal-justice-system-is-broken/\nCLASSIFICATION: Conservative Dignity (Bipartisan)\nFRAMEWORK_QUADRANT: Conservative/Dignity\nVALIDATION_STUDY: Civic Virtue Framework - Dignity vs Tribalism Dimension\nEXTRACTED: December 2024\n\n===== OP-ED CONTENT =====\n\nAs a Democrat from Delaware and a Republican from North Carolina, we disagree on plenty of policy issues. You might think that would be especially true of an issue as historically divisive and politically challenging as crime and punishment.\n\nThat's not the case. We share a strong belief that America's criminal justice system is broken, focusing far too much on criminalization and incarceration and far too little on rehabilitation.\n\nA compelling example of the urgent need for reform is how our system treats juvenile offenders. We know that young people's relationship with the criminal justice apparatus has powerful, lasting consequences for them, their families, and their communities. It is therefore vitally important we make sure that all children who come into contact with the criminal justice system are treated fairly and appropriately, are not forgotten, and are afforded an opportunity to rehabilitate and become productive, contributing members of society.\n\nOur agreement on this issue was on display late last year at a juvenile justice summit, where we shared the stage for a discussion on a key challenge facing our country: a criminal justice system that over-emphasizes incarceration and is woefully inadequate when it comes to rehabilitation, even for our nation's youth.\n\nMen and women in law enforcement work hard to protect our communities across the country. As legislators, we must be committed to developing a criminal justice system that effectively promotes public safety, fairness, and rehabilitation. We believe Congress has both a moral and a fiscal imperative to ensure that our criminal justice system appropriately calibrates sentences to offenses. That is being smart on crime, not soft on crime.\n\nDespite political disagreements in Congress on a broader criminal justice reform package \u2014 disagreements we hope to move past next year \u2014 Democrats and Republicans surely can agree that children shouldn't be locked in a solitary confinement cell for 23 hours a day, or housed with other prisoners twice their age and size, or unnecessarily restrained and shackled for minor infractions, or harshly punished for low-level, nonviolent offenses.\n\nSurely we can agree that juveniles' interactions with the judicial system shouldn't be just about punishment, but instead must also focus on understanding the impacts of what they have done and why it was wrong. A system that focuses on rehabilitation, not punishment, doesn't excuse bad behavior. Rather, it helps all parties heal and move forward, and it keeps all of us safer by breaking cycles of recidivism.\n\nWe both recognize that this system is in desperate need of reform. We share a frustration that some politicians in both parties have been too willing to put politics before policy. We also share a belief that our home states offer a road map forward.\n\nIn North Carolina, several reforms have been made in recent years, including allowing a juvenile's criminal record to be expunged of non-violent offenses, limiting detention for certain offenses, and requiring a parent, guardian, or attorney to be present during police interrogations of any child under the age of 16.\n\nIn Delaware, this year alone, the state legislature passed laws to expand the use of civil citations instead of criminal charges, to end shackling of youth except where it's necessary for safety, to provide free legal representation to all children charged with a crime, and to make it easier for juveniles to expunge their records.\n\nWe've seen some progress at the national level. President Barack Obama rightly acted to end solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons. The Supreme Court ruled that it is cruel and unusual to sentence juveniles to the death penalty or to a mandatory sentence of death in prison.\n\nHere in Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which we both serve, passed the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act on a bipartisan 15-5 vote. Among its many provisions, the bill would limit solitary confinement for juveniles in federal custody. More broadly, it would begin to address the imbalance between incarceration and rehabilitation to reconstitute families, save taxpayer dollars, and restore fairness to our criminal justice system. It achieves this without harming the integrity of public safety as prison sentences would only be recalibrated for certain nonviolent offenders and would require careful judicial oversight.\n\nIn Leviticus 19, the Lord urges Moses, \"Do not pervert justice; do not show partiality to the poor or favoritism to the great, but judge your neighbor fairly.\" We do a great disservice to our nation's future when we do not judge children fairly or treat them justly.\n\nFor the many Americans disillusioned by Washington, consider that support for smart and sensible reforms to our juvenile justice and criminal justice systems is slowly but surely gaining traction across party lines. In the year ahead, we will both remain committed to casting partisan politics aside in order to get these commonsense proposals passed through Congress and signed into law.",

I don't want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and leadership, and especially recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin, who has been a hero of mine on issues of criminal justice reform, as well as Mike Lee, who's been a champion. All of their staffs, everyone who's been involved in the tireless work and efforts that have been going on in what is a bill that is pending on the floor now - the First Step Act.\n\nI also want to recognize the incredible people, many of them advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists, so many of the groups that have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have criminal justice reform in this country. A lot of these groups have been organized and working for years and years, years before I became to the Senate, to try to bring forth criminal justice reform. They've offered insight, they've brought wisdom, they've helped to shape this legislation. Their advocacy has made this a better bill. It's because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill, to begin to deliver some reform to our savagely broken criminal justice system.\n\nI'm proud of this coalition. I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum. I'm proud of the coalition as people from diverse backgrounds. This is how change has been made in this country for generations. But I want to return to this fact: that we are poised to do this bill because of the deeply savage, broken criminal justice system that we have.\n\nSince 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population. And this is because of failed policies by this body that created harsh sentences, harsh mandatory minimum penalties, three-strikes-you're-out, the kind of bills that have helped this population of prisoners to grow to be the largest in terms of percentage on the planet Earth. America is now the preeminent incarceration nation. We are the incarceration capital of the planet Earth.\n\nAnd even though we only have 5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. And today, close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record. We have criminalized the United States population - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.\n\nBut after decades of failed federal policies, and after decades of growing in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation. We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. But our criminal justice system violates those values.\n\nI believe you can tell a lot about a nation not by its buildings, not by its measures or its wealth, but you can tell a lot about the true character of the nation by looking at its prisons and seeing who they incarcerate. You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes and see how they imprison their political opposition. You can go to some countries and see that they actually incarcerate members of the media. We don't do that in the United States, but we in this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, you see overwhelmingly we incarcerate those who are marginalized in our society, those who are most vulnerable in our society.\n\nOverwhelmingly, in the United States of America, our prisons and jails are full of those Americans who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a system that hurts them. Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness. Right now our prisons and jails are filled overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who are survivors of sexual assault, and also overwhelmingly it's full of Americans who are low-income, full of poor folks and people who are disproportionally people of color.\n\nThis is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others. The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.\n\nI'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income, but I tell you right now, my community does not mistake wealth with worth. I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end of most weeks, I draw strength from my community. I see the evidence of the incredible growth that's occurred when good people in a city pull together, work together, and can accomplish things that other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, or just plain dissing them don't think as possible. I'm proud of my community.\n\nBut despite all the work that's been done in the City of Newark, I still live in a community that is both over-criminalized and under-protected because of federal policies, because of policies in this body, policies that mistake the severity of a punishment with the actual security of a people.\n\nWe know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target people of color and low-income communities. We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.\n\nWe now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850. This is a punishing reality. I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.\n\nAnd the truth about human nature, about human beings, is that all of us make mistakes. That's an inevitable part of life. But the way our country's drug laws are designed and applied, a kid in a more privileged community or on a college campus gets a chance to stumble, to learn a lesson, wide margin for error. But a kid living in a community that's low-income or communities that's black and brown, they get trapped by a system that disproportionately impacts their lives than it does others.\n\nAs Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. We see in the United States of America Americans getting trapped in a system that - we know the data is clear - there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs in the United States of America. No difference. But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for possession of drugs.\n\nThis is one of the things that have led to such a dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the United States of America. People right now in our country sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, but encountered a different type of justice system. The scales of justice in America are not balanced.\n\nThis is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt. What do we do in this country with a nonviolent drug offense? What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life. Even after you've come out of a prison sentence, or even if you got no time served at all, once you are convicted for nonviolent drug offense - again, like people in this body and in the White House have done before - if you've been convicted for that crime, potentially in this body, I'm making no accusations, but once you've been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you're one of those folks that's been convicted of a non-violent drug offense, you have to check a box that says you're gonna have a difficulty being hired, that you're gonna have difficulty getting housing, you can't get many business licenses, you can't get food stamps, you can't get a loan from the bank.\n\nIn fact, the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a criminal conviction in this country - 40,000 collateral consequences that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.\n\nAnd so now we're debating a funding bill, it's dominating the news, but we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer, not making us stronger, in fact making us more vulnerable as a community. We have been using government resources not to offer more support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans, putting them into a system that actually harms them often more than helps them with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their trauma.\n\nWe are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that people have already endured, to incarcerate more Americans than ever before in our history, and ultimately makes our neighborhoods and communities - ones like mine - less safe, not more. And despite the fact that our infrastructure in this country is crumbling, that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair, we have been investing in a different type of infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days. Billions and billions of dollars for the constructions of prisons and jails to warehouse human potential - folks who often need help and counseling and mental health care, need to be rehabilitated.\n\nWe've been taking the far more expensive way and warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping them. And we call this system a justice system. It is not meant to be a system of retribution. It's meant to be a justice system. It's not meant to be a system of punishment - it's not meant to be punishment only. It's supposed to be meant to be a justice system.\n\nWe are Americans. We have ideals of restoration, of rehabilitation. Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible. One of our Senate colleagues, a former colleague who stood in this very well, he got into a lot of trouble in his youth, was convicted of multiple crimes - crimes like arson, crimes like assault. He attacked a police officer. He actually became one of the most serious, outspoken advocates for restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson.\n\nAnd this is what he once wrote. He said, \"I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my .22 caliber rifle never struck anybody. I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up call and I listened.\" He went on to say that \"I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community. When a young person is sent up the river, we need to remember that all rivers can change course.\"\n\nHe went from an arsonist, he went from a person that attacked police officers, he went from a person that was admittedly guilty of crimes to a United States Senator, because we are a nation that believes in redemption.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that when most people go to prison, ninety-five percent of those folks right now in state prisons will come back to our communities. And the question is, will they come out further harmed by the system, or better able to start again, better able to avoid more criminality, or will they be people that actually helped to make us safer and stronger, to be elevated towards that ideal of full citizenship?\n\nThose of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith, we know the story of the prodigal child - that child that did wrong, but yet when they came back, their father embraced them. It was that story held in the Christian community as an ideal. But what do we do in America is not the story of the prodigal child, because this is a system that right now inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate them.\n\nThis is a system that still subjects young people to what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement. This is a system that in some places still denies women access to basic sanitary products. This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth. This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically, fracturing entire communities like the one I live in.\n\nIt is a system that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income neighborhoods. In fact, according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers. This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it's hurting every single American.\n\nBut today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system. And that's why I'm proud that this is a bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle - saying, hey, there are things we need to begin to correct in this system. There's ways to make this system more fair. There's ways to make the system better reflect our collective values and ideals.\n\nBecause of this collective work done over the last years, this bill includes critical sentencing reform that will reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back - not legislators, but judges who sit and see all the totality of the facts. Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the racially-based crack cocaine sentencing disparity has already been negotiated down from a hundred to one to 18 to one. It should be equal. It should be one to one, but we've made progress.\n\nThe problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied, and because of that, there are people sitting in jail right now for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a suitcase. We never made this change retroactive. That's not justice.\n\nMaking this fix in this bill alone will mean that thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release, and it addresses some of the racial disparities in our system because 90% of the people that will benefit from that are African-American; 96% are black and Latina.\n\nThis bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision. This bill takes an important step, but still incomplete step, in reforming the way women are treated behind bars. This bill will ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women. Last year I introduced a bill that includes this reform among others, and I'm happy to see it part now of this legislation.\n\nCan we do more? Yes. This legislation is a product of compromise. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, but if we pass this legislation, it is a step in the right direction, and I hope momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.\n\nLet's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step, will affect thousands and thousands of lives. Those are not just some people. When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of justice, you affect the lives of all Americans, because we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.\n\nDr. King said justice is indivisible, and he was right. We cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it won't affect us all as a whole. It couldn't be further from the truth. You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all. You cannot keep injustice for some without it cheapening the justice of us all.\n\nAs a man much greater than any in this body once said, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.\" We cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal justice system that is so punishing some is not hurting this country as a whole. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound. This bill is a step - a step towards healing.\n\nMr. President, it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point. I've had the opportunity to sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals in organizations who on most issues I often disagree with, but we have found common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle - values of freedom, values of liberty, values of equality, values of fairness and justice.\n\nWe share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us. This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity - the ideals that were put forth by our founders and that have been aspired to in every generation and have been worked on in every generation, making us a more perfect union.\n\nWe know that our nation's history - bills and debates we've seen in this very body - we know our nation's history is scarred by many wretched injustices: slavery and the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation. But like people, individuals who've done wrong in the past, like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change. We as a nation have demonstrated the capacity to improve. Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation the capacity to redeem ourselves.\n\nNone of us should ever be judged by the least of what we've done, but instead by our ability and our capacity to find redemption. Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all. And standing for each other, we have worked with each other, we have sacrificed with each other, despite differences in race and differences in color, difference in religion and creed.\n\nEvery single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions because we recognize the ideal that is above the President's desk, written in stone here - that ideal of e pluribus unum: out of the many, one. We know that that's not just a slogan. Those aren't just words. It is a calling to the people of this country.\n\nI want to see more than the bill we have today, and I know we can do more than just this bill we have today. But this is a first step. It is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected. This is a step in the right direction. I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\n\nWork to do in this country. I'm proud to have been a part of what can be a historic step in the right direction. May our work continue.\n\nMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n=== elizabeth_warren_nyc.txt ===\nElizabeth Warren Speaks in New York City\n\nhttps://2020.elizabethwarren.com/nyc-speech\n\nSeptember 16, 2019\n\n\n\nNew York City, NY - Elizabeth Warren delivered a speech today at Washington Square Park, near the site of the former Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. Elizabeth spoke about how corruption in Washington has allowed the rich and powerful to tilt the rules and grow richer and more powerful.\n\nBelow are her remarks as prepared for delivery: \n\nThanks, acknowledgements\n\n\n\nHello, New York!\n\nWhen so many good people show up, I usually do a town hall followed by selfies. But tonight is something different. I want to tell a story that I haven\u2019t had a chance to tell before\u2014an important story about our past and our future. But I\u2019ll still stay afterwards for as long as anyone wants to take selfies. Some things we just don\u2019t mess with!  \n\nI\u2019m especially glad to be here in Washington Square Park. I wanted to give this speech here\u2014but not because of the arch behind me or the president this square is named for. \n\nNo: we\u2019re not here today because of famous arches or famous men. In fact, we\u2019re not here because of men at all.\n\nWe\u2019re here because of some hard-working women. Women who, more than a hundred years ago, worked long hours in a brown, ten-story building a block that way. Women who worked at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory.\n\nIt was March 25th, 1911, a Saturday.\n\nAt about 4:45 in the afternoon, people walking through this park looked up and saw black smoke billowing into the sky. A fire had started in a building over there. Inside that building, on the top three floors, deadly flames leapt from a bin, to the oily floors, and from the floors to the walls, sweeping across the workrooms and trapping the workers.  \n\nFighting for their lives, women\u2014girls really, some as young as 14\u2014raced to escape. But the exit doors were locked. Others ran to the windows \u2013 waving their arms and screaming for help. \n\nBut no help was coming. \n\nThe fire department\u2019s ladders could only reach to the 6th floor.  \n\nThe flames leapt higher, and women climbed out onto the ledges.  \n\nAnd as people on the ground stood in shocked silence, a woman jumped. Then another, then another. They hit the ground with a sickening thud. They died on impact.  So many, so fast that the women\u2019s bodies piled up on the sidewalk. Their blood ran into the gutters.   \n\nDozens more were trapped inside. Trapped because the door to the staircase was locked\u2014locked by bosses afraid the workers might steal scraps of cloth. Firefighters would later find a pile of burned bodies next to that very door. \n\nIt took 18 minutes for 146 people to die. Mostly women. Mostly immigrants\u2014Jewish and Italian. Mostly people who made as little as $5 a week to get their shot at the American dream. \n\nIt was one of the worst industrial disasters in American history. One of the worst, but it should not have been a surprise. \n\nFor years, across the city, women factory workers and their allies had been sounding the alarm about dangerous and squalid conditions\u2014fighting for shorter hours and higher pay. They protested. They went on strike. They got coverage in the press. Everyone knew about these problems. \n\nBut the fat profits were making New York\u2019s factory owners rich, and they had no plans to give that up. Instead of changing conditions at the factories, the owners worked their political connections.\n\nThey made campaign contributions and talked with their friends in the legislature. They greased the state government so thoroughly that nothing changed. Business owners got richer, politicians got more powerful, and working people paid the price.\n\nDoes any of that sound familiar?\n\nTake any big problem we have in America today and you don\u2019t have to dig very deep to see the same system at work.\n\nClimate change. Gun safety. Health care. On the face of it, these three are totally different issues. But despite our being the strongest and wealthiest country in the history of the world, our democracy is paralyzed.  \n\nWhy? Because giant corporations have bought off our government.\n\nAmericans are killed by floods and fires in a rapidly warming planet. Why? Because huge fossil fuel corporations have bought off our government.\n\nAmericans are killed with unthinkable speed and efficiency in our streets and stores and schools. Why? Because the gun industry has bought off our government.\n\nAmericans are dying because they can\u2019t afford to fill prescriptions or pay for treatment. Why? Because health insurance companies and drug companies have bought off our government.\n\nAmericans disagree on many things, but we don\u2019t want each other\u2019s homes burned down by wildfires. We don\u2019t want each other\u2019s children murdered at school. We don\u2019t want each other\u2019s families bankrupted by medical bills. \n\nWhat we want is for our government to do something!\n\nAnd yet, our federal government is unable to act, unable to take even the most basic steps to protect the American people. \n\nWhen you see a government that works great for those with money and connections and doesn\u2019t work much for anyone else, that\u2019s corruption\u2014plain and simple. And it\u2019s time to call it out for what it is. \n\nCorruption has put our planet at risk. Corruption has broken our economy. And corruption is breaking our democracy.\n\nI know what\u2019s broken, I\u2019ve got a plan to fix it, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for President of the United States.\n\n--\n\nOK, let\u2019s start with the obvious. Donald Trump is corruption in the flesh. He is sworn to serve the people of the United States, but he serves only himself and his partners in corruption.  \n\nHe tries to divide us\u2014white against Black, Christians against Muslims, straight against queer and trans, everyone against immigrants. Because if we\u2019re all fighting each other, no one will notice that he and his buddies are stealing more and more of our country\u2019s wealth and destroying the future for everyone else. \n\nAs bad as things are, we have to recognize that our problems didn\u2019t start with Donald Trump. He made them worse, but we need to take a deep breath and recognize that a country that elects Donald Trump is already in serious trouble.  \n\nRepublican politicians sold out a long time ago. Filling the courts with judges who expand the rights of corporations while they destroy the rights of citizens. Passing tax cuts for wealthy donors, while doing nothing to help working families. Sucking up corporate donations while lying about climate change, lying about guns, and lying about health care.\n\nAnd too many politicians in both parties have convinced themselves that playing the money-for-influence game is the only way to get things done.\n\nWhat has all this corrupt business-as-usual gotten us? The extinction of one species after another as the earth heats up.  Children slaughtered by assault weapons. The highest levels of inequality in a century. Wages that barely budge. Crippling student loan debt. Shrinking opportunity for the next generation and the one after that. The American people get it\u2014and they are sick of it.  \n\nCorruption has taken over our government\u2014and we\u2019re running out of time. We must root it out and to return our democracy to the people. And\u2014I\u2019ve got a plan for that!\n\nYes, I've got a lot of plans, but they all come back to one simple idea: put economic and political power in the hands of the people.\n\nWe start by rooting out corruption in government. No more business-as-usual\u2014let\u2019s attack the corruption head on!  \n\nI have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate\u2014a plan to shut down the ability of the rich and powerful to use their money to tilt every decision in Washington.  And here\u2019s a sample of what we can do:\n\nEnd lobbying as we know it.\n\nNo high-ranking public official should be thinking about their next job while they are collecting a paycheck to represent the American people\u2014so I have a lifetime ban on Senators, Congressmen and Cabinet Secretaries from ever becoming lobbyists \n\nNo more hiring corporate lobbyists to staff up the federal government.  \n\nThe right of every person in this country to petition their government does not protect a multi-billion dollar influence industry whose sole purpose is to undermine democracy and tilt every decision in favor of those who can pay. So let's shut down this industry and return our government to the people. \n\nAnd there\u2019s more:\n\nNo more secret meetings\u2014every single meeting between a lobbyist and a public official should be a matter of public record. \n\nNo more lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. \n\nAnd no more campaign contributions or bundling by lobbyists. Contributing to a campaign at the same time you are paid to influence those same government officials is the very definition of bribery, and we\u2019re going to put a stop to it.\n\nAnyone\u2014anyone\u2014who wants to run for public office will have to put their tax returns online. \n\nThere\u2019s more: \n\nPresidents, cabinet members, members of Congress will be barred from owning businesses on the side. Barred from owning and trading in individual stocks. Take care of the people\u2019s business or your own business, but you can\u2019t do both at the same time. \n\nCorruption and influence-peddling has seeped into every corner of our government, so it\u2019s time for some new plans for regulators. \n\nFar too many agencies act like wholly owned subsidiaries of the companies they're supposed to regulate. When these agencies are captured, the results are pollution and financial advisers who cheat people\u2014all while regulators look the other way.\n\nEnough is enough. We will take down the \"for sale\" signs hanging outside of every federal building in Washington.  \n\nIt\u2019s also time to call out corruption in the federal judiciary.      \n\nIncreasingly, big shot corporate lawyers are getting appointed as federal judges, and they turn out one decision after another in favor of corporations and against the interests of American consumers, against unions, and against vulnerable people who must count on the courts to protect their rights. Shadowy right-wing groups have spent millions of dollars to ram through aggressively unqualified nominees who are likely to help advance their causes.  \n\nNobody should be surprised that public confidence in our federal courts is at an all-time low. But we can fix it.  \n\nWe will rewrite the basic code of ethics for federal judges. \n\nWe will appoint a new generation of judges with diverse backgrounds and a wide range of legal experiences\u2014judges who actually believe in fundamental principles like rule of law, civil rights, and equal justice.\n\nAnd finally, we will end the corruption of our campaign finance system. \n\nOverturn Citizens United\u2014democracy is not for sale.\n\nGet rid of SuperPACs and secret spending by billionaires.\n\nAnd break the big donor stranglehold by creating a system of public funding of our elections. \n\nI know that some people will always have more money, so they can own more shoes or more clothes than other people. But no one should own more of our democracy!  \n\nCorruption comes in other forms too\u2014and I have plans for those.\n\nA plan to end the corrupt practice of selling fancy ambassadorships to wealthy donors, because American diplomacy should not be for sale.\n\nA plan to abolish private prisons. No one should make a profit locking people up\u2014and no one should have a financial incentive to lobby Congress to lock up even more people. \n\nA plan to stop selling access to federal lands and national parks to giant polluters, and to break the stranglehold of the coal industry and oil industry in energy production and transportation.\n\nAnd yes, when we\u2019re talking corruption, we need to call it out in the Oval Office. I read the Mueller Report, all 448 pages. No one is above the law, not even the president of the United States\u2014impeachment is our Constitutional duty. \n\nSo there it is: Step one: tackle corruption head on. \n\nThe next task: transform our economy so that every person\u2014no matter where they live, or who their parents are, or how much money they have\u2014every person has real opportunity: the chance to work hard, play by the same set of rules, and take care of themselves and the people they love.\n\nCorruption in Washington has allowed the rich and powerful to tilt the rules and grow richer and more powerful. But this small slice at the top hasn\u2019t just scooped up a huge chunk of the wealth all of us have worked hard to produce\u2014they\u2019ve also gobbled up opportunity itself. For the rich and powerful, there are first, second, third, and fourth chances to get ahead. But for a lot of Americans, and especially for people of color, there\u2019s barely one\u2014or, for some, no chance at all.\n\nWe have the power to fix that. We\u2019re the wealthiest nation in the history of the world\u2014we can afford Medicare for All to save our people and a Green New Deal to save our planet. \n\nWe just need real investments in working people. \n\nWe start with more power in the hands of workers. Make it easy to join a union, and give unions more power when they negotiate.  \n\nAnd yes, it\u2019s time for a wealth tax. That\u2019s a two-cent tax on fortunes over $50 million. Your first $50 million\u2014don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re in the clear. But for the 50 millionth and first dollar, pitch in two cents\u2014and two cents for every dollar after that.  Just two cents.\n\nBecause I look at it this way: You built a great fortune\u2014well, or you inherited one?  Good for you. But I guarantee that any great fortune in America was built, at least in part, using workers all of us helped pay to educate. Built at least in part getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay to build. Built at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay their salaries.  \n\nAnd we\u2019re happy to do it. This is America\u2014we\u2019re happy to invest in opportunities for everyone.  But we\u2019re saying that if you make it really, really, really big, bigger than 50 million dollars, then pitch in two cents so everyone else can have a chance.\n\nAnd what can we do with two cents?\n\nUniversal childcare for every baby in this country, age zero to five.\n\nUniversal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in this country.\n\nRaise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America.\n\nMake technical school, community college and four-year college tuition-free for everyone who wants to get an education.\n\nLevel the playing field and put $50 billion into Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other minority serving institutions.\n\nAnd cancel student loan debt for 95% of people who have it. \n\nWhat does all that mean? Real opportunity\u2014not just for people born into privilege. Opportunity for everyone.\n\nOpportunity\u2014real opportunity\u2014requires honesty. Working families all across this country have been denied the opportunities they deserve, but the path for Black and Brown and Native families has been even steeper. That\u2019s why my plans tackle historical injustice head on and here are a few examples:\n\nMy student debt cancellation plan will help close the wealth gap between Black and white families.\n\nMy criminal justice plans will end the practice of mass incarceration that has destroyed the lives of so many Black and Brown men.\n\nMy housing plan will help families living in formerly redlined areas buy a home and start building the kind of wealth that government-sponsored discrimination denied their parents and grandparents. \n\nMy climate plan includes justice for the Black and Brown communities that have struggled with the impact of pollution, and my plan respects the rights of Native Americans to protect their lands and be good stewards of this earth.\n\nAnd on day one of my administration, I will use my executive authority to start closing the pay gap between women of color and everyone else\u2014because it\u2019s about time we fully valued the work of women of color.\n\nWe must recognize the systemic discrimination that infects our economy, and we must work actively\u2014and deliberately\u2014to root it out and set us on a better path. \n\nThe time for holding back is over. We need big, structural change! \n\nNow I know what some people are thinking. Whoa, too much. Too big. Too hard. But I know this change is possible\u2014I know it, because America has made big, structural change before.\n\nLet me take you back to that day of the fire .\n\nA woman was visiting friends who lived in a townhouse behind me when the fire broke out. \n\nShe hurried into the street, joining the crowds as they ran across this park and headed to the Triangle Factory. When she got there, she watched.  Watched as women on the ledge begged for help. Watched as they held each other. Watched as they jumped to their deaths.\n\nThe woman watching was Frances Perkins. She was thirty years old and already a workers\u2019 rights activist, but that day set change in motion.  \n\nA week later, the women\u2019s trade unions organized a funeral march, and half a million people showed up to march down Fifth Avenue, right behind me. Half a million people in 1911.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t their first march, but this time was different. While the women of the trade unions kept pushing from the outside, Frances pushed from the inside. She understood that those women died because of the greed of their bosses and the corruption of their elected officials. \n\nSo she went up to Albany, ready to fight. She worked to create a commission investigating factory conditions, and then she served as its lead investigator. Remember, this was years before women could even vote, let alone play major roles in government. \n\nBut Frances had a plan. She and her fellow activists fought for fire safety, of course\u2014and they got it. Next time you do a fire drill at school or work or you see a plainly-marked fire exit at work, think of Frances and the Triangle women, because they\u2019re the reason the laws changed. \n\nBut they didn\u2019t stop with fire safety. With Frances working the system from the inside, the women workers organizing and applying pressure from the outside, they rewrote New York State\u2019s labor laws from top to bottom to protect workers.\n\nOver time, Frances Perkins became the state\u2019s leading expert on working conditions. Later, when Franklin Roosevelt was elected governor, he appointed her to head his Labor department in Albany. And, four years after that, in the depths of the Great Depression, when Roosevelt became President, he asked Frances to come to Washington to address the crisis as Secretary of Labor for the entire nation.\n\nFrances Perkins became the first woman in history to serve in the Cabinet. And what did she push for when she got there? Big, structural change.  \n\nShe used the same model she and her friends had used after the Triangle Fire: she worked the political system relentlessly from the inside, while a sustained movement applied pressure from the outside. As Frances Perkins put it: the Triangle Fire was \u201cthe day the New Deal was born.\u201d\n\nSo, what did one woman\u2014one very persistent woman\u2014backed up by millions of people across this country get done?  Social Security. Unemployment insurance. Abolition of child labor. Minimum wage. The right to join a union. Even the very existence of the weekend.  Big, structural change. One woman, and millions of people to back her up. \n\nThe tragic story of the Triangle factory fire is a story about power.\n\nA story of what happens when the rich and the powerful take control of government and use it to increase their own profits while they stick it to working people. \n\nBut what happened in the aftermath of the fire is a different story about power\u2014our power, about what\u2019s possible when we all fight together as one. \n\nOver and over, throughout our history, Americans have been told that it wasn\u2019t possible to make big, structural change\u2014and that they should just give up.\n\nThe abolitionists were told it\u2019s just too hard, give up now.\n\nSuffragettes were told it\u2019s just too hard, give up now.\n\nEarly union organizers were told it\u2019s just too hard, give up now.\n\nFoot soldiers in the civil rights movement were told it\u2019s just too hard, give up now.\n\nLGBTQ activists were told it\u2019s just too hard, give up now.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t give up. They organized. They built a grassroots movement. They persisted. And they changed the course of American history.\n\n2020 is about the direction America goes, not just for four years, but for generations to come.  Yes, there\u2019s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared. But we can't choose a candidate we don't believe in just because we're too scared to do anything else.  And Democrats can\u2019t win if we\u2019re scared and looking backward.\n\nWe win when we meet the moment. We win when we stand up for what is right. And we win when we get out there and fight for it. \n\nI am not afraid. And you can't be afraid, either.\n\nSo if you\u2019re ready to fight. Join me. \n\nGo to ElizabethWarren.com. Help us organize. Volunteer. Donate five bucks. Text \u201cFIGHT\u201d to 24477. We need everyone\u2014all-in.\n\nBecause here\u2019s the truth.\n\nThis is our moment in history. Our moment to dream big, fight hard\u2014and win.\n\n=== john_lewis_1963_march_washington.txt ===\n**John Lewis - Speech at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom**\n\n**Bibliographic Information:**\n- **Speaker:** John Lewis, Chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)\n- **Event:** March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom\n- **Speech Type:** Civil Rights Address\n- **Date:** August 28, 1963\n- **Location:** Lincoln Memorial, Washington, D.C.\n- **Age of Speaker:** 23 years old\n- **Source:** NowThis Impact (YouTube Archive)\n- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqR9LbT1_w\n- **Classification:** Progressive Dignity (Validation Set)\n- **Historical Significance:** One of the youngest speakers at the March on Washington, Lewis delivered a powerful address calling for immediate civil rights action. This speech helped establish him as a key leader in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n---\n\n[Applause] We march today for jobs and freedom, but we have nothing to be proud of, for hundreds and thousands of our brothers are not here. They're receiving starvation wages or no wages at all. While we stand here, there are sharecroppers in the Delta of Mississippi who are out in the field working for less than three dollars a day, twelve hours a day. While we stand here, there are students in jail on trumped-up charges. Our brother James Farmer, along with many others, is also in jail.\n\nWe come here today with a great sense of misgiving. It is true that we support the administration's civil rights bill. We support it with great reservations, however. Unless Title Three is put in this bill, there's nothing to protect the young children and old women who must face police dogs and fire hoses in the South while they engage in peaceful demonstrations. In its present form, this bill will not protect the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear of a police state. It will not protect the hundreds and thousands of people who have been arrested upon trumped-up charges.\n\nWhat about the three young men - SNCC field secretaries in Americus, Georgia - who face the death penalty for engaging in peaceful protest? As it stands now, the voting section of this bill will not help the thousands of black people who want to vote. It will not help the citizens of Mississippi, of Alabama, and Georgia, who are qualified to vote but lack a sixth-grade education.\n\nWe must have legislation that will protect the Mississippi sharecropper who is put off of his farm because he dares to register to vote. We need a bill that will provide for the homeless and starving people of this nation. We need a bill to ensure the equality of a maid who earns five dollars a week in the home of a family whose total income is one hundred thousand dollars a year. We must have a good FEPC bill.\n\nMy friends, let us not forget that we are involved in a serious social revolution. By and large, American politics is dominated by politicians who build their careers on immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political, economic, and social exploitation. There are exceptions, of course - we salute those - but what political leader can stand up and say, \"My party is the party of principles\"? For the party of Kennedy is also the party of Eastland. The party of Javits is also the party of Goldwater.\n\nWhere is our party? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march on Washington? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march in the streets of Birmingham? Where is the political party that will protect the citizens of Albany, Georgia? Do you know that in Albany, Georgia, nine of our leaders have been indicted, not by Dixiecrats, but by the federal government for peaceful protest?\n\nBut what did the federal government do when Albany police deputies beat Attorney C.B. King and left him half-dead? What did the federal government do when local police officials kicked and assaulted the pregnant wife of Slater King, and she lost her baby? To those who have said, \"Be patient and wait,\" we must say that we cannot be patient. We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now!\n\n[Applause] [Music] [Applause] \n\nWe are tired! We are tired of being beaten by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jails over and over again. And then you holler, \"Be patient.\" How long can we be patient? We want our freedom and we want it now!\n\n[Applause] \n\nWe do not want to go to jail, but we will go to jail if this is the price we must pay for love, brotherhood, and true peace. I appeal to all of you to get in this great revolution that is sweeping this nation. Get in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation until true freedom comes, until the revolution of 1776 is complete.\n\nWe must get in this revolution and complete the revolution. For in the Delta of Mississippi, in southwest Georgia, in the Black Belt of Alabama, in Harlem, in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and all over this nation, the black masses are on the march for jobs and freedom.\n\nThey're talking about slow down and stop. We will not stop! All of the forces of Eastland, Barnett, Wallace, and Thurmond will not stop this revolution!\n\n[Applause] \n\nIf we do not get meaningful legislation out of this Congress, the time will come when we will not confine our marching to Washington. We will march through the South, through the streets of Jackson, through the streets of Danville, through the streets of Cambridge, through the streets of Birmingham. But we will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of dignity that we have shown here today.\n\n[Music] [Applause] \n\nBy the forces of our demands, our determination, and our numbers, we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy. We must say: Wake up America! Wake up! For we cannot stop, and we will not and cannot be patient!\n\n[Applause]\n\n=== obama_2004_dnc.txt ===\n**Barack Obama - 2004 Democratic National Convention Keynote Speech**\n\n**Bibliographic Information:**\n- **Speaker:** Barack Obama, Illinois State Senator and U.S. Senate Candidate\n- **Event:** 2004 Democratic National Convention\n- **Speech Type:** Keynote Address\n- **Date:** July 27, 2004\n- **Location:** Fleet Center, Boston, Massachusetts\n- **Source:** C-SPAN Historic Convention Speeches\n- **URL:** https://www.c-span.org/program/historic-convention-speeches/barack-obama-2004-democratic-national-convention-keynote-speech/193754\n- **Classification:** Progressive Dignity (Validation Set)\n- **Historical Significance:** This keynote address launched Obama into national prominence and is widely regarded as one of the most influential political speeches in modern American history.\n\n---\n\nThank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Dick Durbin. You make us all proud. On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention.\n\nTonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance, my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.\n\nWhile studying here my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor, my grandfather signed up for duty. Joined the army, marched across Europe. Back home my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through F.H.A., and later moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity. And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter.\n\nA common dream born of two continents. My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, believing in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined -- they imagined me going to the best schools in the land even though they weren't rich because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential. They have both passed away now and yet I know that on this night they look down on me with great pride.\n\nThey stand here and I stand here today grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me and that in no other country on earth is my story even possible.\n\nTonight we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation. Not because of the height of our skyscrapers or the power of our military or the size of our economy, our pride is based on a very simple premise. Summed up in a declaration made over 200 years ago. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThat is the true genius of America. A faith in simple dreams. An insistence on small miracles. That we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. And we can say what we think, write what we think without hearing a sudden knock on the door, that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe, that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution and that our votes will be counted, at least most of the time.\n\nThis year in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forebears and the promise of future generations. Fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents, I say to you we have more work to do.\n\nMore work to do for the workers I met in Illinois who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico and now we're having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay $7 an hour, or the father I met that was losing his job and choking back the tears wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on. More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis and thousands more like her who has the grades, has the drive, has the will but doesn't have the money to go to college.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, the people I meet in small towns and big cities and diners and office parks, they don't expect government to solve all of their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to. Go into the counties around Chicago and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or by the Pentagon. Go into any inner city neighborhood and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn. They know the parents have to teach. The children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things.\n\nPeople don't expect government to solve all their problems but they sense deep in their bones that with just a slight change in priorities we could make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life. And that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better and they want that choice.\n\nIn this election we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer and that man is John Kerry. John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because they've defined his life from his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate. He has devoted himself to this country. Again and again we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home. John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves. John Kerry believes in energy independence so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties or use faith as a wedge to divide us. And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes but it should never be the first option.\n\nYou know, a while back -- a while back I met a young man in a V.F.W. hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, 6'2\", clear-eyed with an easy smile. He told me he joined the Marines and was headed to Iraq the following week. As I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service I thought this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child.\n\nBut then I asked myself, are we serving him as well as he's serving us? I thought of the 900 men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who won't be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families I met struggling to get by without a loved one's full income or whose loved one returned with a limb missing but still lack long-term health care benefits because they were reservists.\n\nWhen we send our young men and women into harm's way we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace and earn the respect of the world.\n\nNow let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued. And they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in America. And he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism there's another ingredient in the American saga. A belief that we're all connected as one people. If there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me even if it's not my child. If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription drugs and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer even if it's not my grandparent. If there's an Arab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process that threatens my civil liberties.\n\nIt is that fundamental belief -- it is that fundamental belief I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper that makes this country work. It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one American family. Out of many, one.\n\nNow even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight there is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America. There's the United States of America.\n\nThe pundits, the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states, red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats, but I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and, yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who oppose the war in Iraq and there are patriots who support the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.\n\nIn the end that's what this election is about. Do we participate in the politics of cynicism or in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here, the willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it or health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. That's not what I'm talking about.\n\nI'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs. The hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores. The hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta, the hope of a mill worker's son who dares to defy the odds, the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. Hope -- hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope.\n\nIn the end that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation, a belief in things not seen. A belief that there are better days ahead. I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with the road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs for the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that we have righteous wind at our backs and as we stand on the crossroads of history we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.\n\nAmerica, tonight if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine the people will rise up in November and John Kerry will be sworn in as president and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president and this country will reclaim its promise and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.\n\n=== obama_2012_dnc_acceptance_speech.txt ===\n**Barack Obama - 2012 Democratic National Convention Acceptance Speech**\n\n**Bibliographic Information:**\n- **Speaker:** Barack Obama, 44th President of the United States\n- **Event:** 2012 Democratic National Convention\n- **Speech Type:** Presidential Nomination Acceptance Address\n- **Date:** September 6, 2012\n- **Location:** Time Warner Cable Arena, Charlotte, North Carolina\n- **Source:** NPR Transcript (Federal News Service)\n- **URL:** https://www.npr.org/2012/09/06/160713941/transcript-president-obamas-convention-speech\n- **Classification:** Progressive Dignity (Validation Set)\n- **Historical Significance:** Obama's acceptance speech for his re-election campaign, delivered during his presidency, reflecting on first-term achievements and outlining his vision for a second term.\n\n---\n\nPresident Obama gives his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., on Thursday. Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you. (Sustained cheers, applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.\n\nMichelle, I love you so much. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nA few nights ago, everybody was reminded just what a lucky man I am. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMalia and Sasha, we are so proud of you. (Cheers, applause.) And yes, you do have to go to school in the morning. (Chuckles.) (Laughter, applause.)\n\nAnd Joe Biden, thank you for being the very best vice president I could have ever hoped for \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 and being a strong and loyal friend.\n\nMadam Chairwoman, delegates, I accept your nomination for president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Now, the first time I addressed this convention, in 2004, I was a younger man \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 a Senate candidate from Illinois who spoke about hope, not blind optimism, not wishful thinking but hope in the face of difficulty, hope in the face of uncertainty, that dogged faith in the future which has pushed this nation forward even when the odds are great, even when the road is long.\n\nEight years later that hope has been tested by the cost of war, by one of the worst economic crises in history and by political gridlock that's left us wondering whether it's still even possible to tackle the challenges of our time. I know campaigns can seem small, even silly sometimes.\n\nTrivial things become big distractions. Serious issues become sound bites. The truth gets buried under an avalanche of money and advertising. And if you're sick of hearing me approve this message, believe me, so am I. (Laughter, cheers, applause.)\n\nBut when all is said and done, when you pick up that ballot to vote, you will face the clearest choice of any time in a generation. (Cheers.) Over the next few years big decisions will be made in Washington on jobs, the economy, taxes and deficits, energy, education, war and peace \u2014 decisions that will have a huge impact on our lives and on our children's lives for decades to come.\n\nAnd on every issue, the choice you face won't just be between two candidates or two parties. It will be a choice between two different paths for America, a choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future. Ours is a fight to restore the values that built the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world has ever known \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 the values my grandfather defended as a soldier in Patton's army, the values that drove my grandmother to work on a bomber assembly line while he was gone. They knew they were part of something larger \u2014 a nation that triumphed over fascism and depression, a nation where the most innovative businesses turn out the world's best products, and everyone shared in that pride and success from the corner office to the factory floor.\n\nMy grandparents were given the chance to go to college and buy their home \u2014 their own home and fulfill the basic bargain at the heart of America's story, the promise that hard work will pay off, that responsibility will be rewarded, that everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same rules, from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington, D.C. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd I ran for president because I saw that basic bargain slipping away. I began my career helping people in the shadow of a shuttered steel mill at a time when too many good jobs were starting to move overseas. And by 2008 we had seen nearly a decade in which families struggled with costs that kept rising but paychecks that didn't, folks racking up more and more debt just to make the mortgage or pay tuition, put gas in the car or food on the table. And when the house of cards collapsed in the Great Recession, millions of innocent Americans lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings, a tragedy from which we're still fighting to recover.\n\nNow, our friends down in Tampa at the Republican convention were more than happy to talk about everything they think is wrong with America. But they didn't have much to say about how they'd make it right. (Cheers, applause.) They want your vote, but they don't want you to know their plan. And that's because all they have to offer is the same prescriptions they've had for the last 30 years. Have a surplus? Try a tax cut. Deficit too high \u2014 try another.\n\nFeel a cold coming on? Take two tax cuts, roll back some regulations, and call us in the morning. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nNow, I've cut taxes for those who need it \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 middle-class families, small businesses. But I don't believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs to our shores, or pay down our deficit. I don't believe that firing teachers or kicking students off financial aid will grow the economy \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 or help us compete with the scientists and engineers coming out of China. After all we've been through, I don't believe that rolling back regulations on Wall Street will help the small-businesswoman expand, or the laid-off construction worker keep his home.\n\nWe have been there, we've tried that, and we're not going back. We are moving forward, America. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nNow, I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy. I never have. You didn't elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear. You elected me to tell you the truth. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd the truth is, it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades. It'll require common effort, shared responsibility, and the kind of bold, persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd by the way, those of us who carry on his party's legacy should remember that not every problem can be remedied with another government program or dictate from Washington.\n\nBut know this, America: Our problems can be solved. (Cheers, applause.) Our challenges can be met. (Applause.) The path we offer may be harder, but it leads to a better place, and I'm asking you to choose that future. (Applause.)\n\nI'm asking you to rally around a set of goals for your country, goals in manufacturing, energy, education, national security and the deficit, real, achievable plans that will lead to new jobs, more opportunity and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation. That's what we can do in the next four years, and that is why I am running for a second term as president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nWe can choose a future where we export more products and outsource fewer jobs. After a decade that was defined by what we bought and borrowed, we're getting back to basics and doing what America's always done best. We are making things again. (Applause.) I've met workers in Detroit and Toledo who feared \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 they'd never build another American car. And today they can't build them fast enough because we reinvented a dying auto industry that's back on the top of the world. (Cheers, applause.) I worked with business leaders who are bringing jobs back to America not because our workers make less pay, but because we make better products \u2014 (cheers) \u2014 because we work harder and smarter than anyone else.\n\n(Cheers, applause.) I've signed trade agreements that are helping our companies sell more goods to millions of new customers, goods that are stamped with three proud words: \"Made in America.\" (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: And after a decade of decline, this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last 2 1/2 years. (Cheers.) And now you have a choice. We can give more tax breaks to corporations that shift jobs overseas --\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: No!\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: \u2014 or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs here in the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.) We can help big factories and small businesses double their exports. And if we choose this path, we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next four years. You can make that happen. (Cheers, applause.) You can choose that future.\n\nYou can choose the path where we control more of our own energy. After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. (Cheers, applause.) We have doubled our use of renewable energy, and thousands of Americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries. (Cheers, applause.) In the last year alone, we cut oil imports by 1 million barrels a day, more than any administration in recent history. (Cheers, applause.) And today the United States of America is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decades. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nSo now you have a choice between a strategy that reverses this progress or one that builds on it.\n\nWe've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration in the last three years, and we'll open more. But unlike my opponent, I will not let oil companies write this country's energy plan or endanger our coastlines or collect another $4 billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers. (Cheers, applause.) We're offering a better path.\n\nWe're offering a better path where we \u2014 a future where we keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal, where farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and trucks, where construction workers build homes and factories that waste less energy, where \u2014 where we develop a hundred-year supply of natural gas that's right beneath our feet. If you choose this path, we can cut our oil imports in half by 2020 and support more than 600,000 new jobs in natural gas alone. (Cheers, applause.\n\nAnd yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet, because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. (Cheers, applause.) They are a threat to our children's future.\n\nAnd in this election, you can do something about it. (Cheers, applause.) You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete, no matter how old they are or how much money they have.\n\nEducation was the gateway to opportunity for me. (Cheers.) It was the gateway for Michelle. It was \u2014 it was the gateway for most of you. And now more than ever it is the gateway to a middle-class life.\n\nFor the first time in a generation, nearly every state has answered our call to raise their standards for teaching and learning. (Cheers, applause.) Some of the worst schools in the country have made real gains in math and reading. Millions of students are paying less for college today because we finally took on a system that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on banks and lenders. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd now you have a choice. We can gut education, or we can decide that in the United States of America, no child should have her dreams deferred because of a crowded classroom or a crumbling school. No family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don't have the money. (Cheers, applause.) No company should have to look for workers overseas because they couldn't find any with the right skills here at home. (Cheers, applause.) That's not our future. That is not our future. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nA government has a role in this. But teachers must inspire. Principals must lead. Parents must instill a thirst for learning. And students, you've got to do the work. (Cheers, applause.) And together, I promise you we can outeducate and outcompete any nation on earth. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nSo help me. Help me recruit a hundred thousand math and science teachers within 10 years and improve early childhood education. (Cheers, applause.) Help give 2 million workers the chance to learn skills at their community college that will lead directly to a job. Help us work with colleges and universities to cut in half the growth of tuition costs over the next 10 years.\n\nWe can meet that goal together. (Cheers, applause.) You can choose that future for America. (Cheers, applause.) That's our future.\n\nYou know, in a world of new threats and new challenges, you can choose leadership that has been tested and proven. Four years ago I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did. (Cheers, applause.) I promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have. (Cheers, applause.) We've blunted the Taliban's momentum in Afghanistan and in 2014, our longest war will be over. (Cheers, applause.) A new tower rises above the New York skyline, al- Qaida is on the path to defeat and Osama bin Laden is dead. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd tonight we pay tribute to the Americans who still serve in harm's way. We are forever in debt to a generation whose sacrifice has made this country safer and more respected. We will never forget you, and so long as I'm commander in chief, we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known. (Cheers, applause.) When you take off the uniform, we will serve you as well as you've served us, because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head or the care that they need when they come home.\n\n(Cheers, applause.)\n\nAround the world, we've strengthened old alliances and forged new coalitions to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. We've reasserted our power across the Pacific and stood up to China on behalf of our workers. From Burma to Libya to South Sudan, we have advanced the rights and dignity of all human beings \u2014 (cheers) \u2014 men and women; Christians and Muslims and Jews. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nBut for all the progress that we've made, challenges remain. Terrorist plots must be disrupted. Europe's crisis must be contained. Our commitment to Israel's security must not waver, and neither must our pursuit of peace. (Cheers, applause.) The Iranian government must face a world that stays united against its nuclear ambitions. The historic change sweeping across the Arab world must be defined not by the iron fist of a dictator or the hate of extremists, but by the hopes and aspirations of ordinary people who are reaching for the same rights that we celebrate here today. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nSo now we have a choice. My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy. (Laughter, applause.)\n\nBut from all that we've seen and heard, they want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly.\n\nAfter all, you don't call Russia our number one enemy \u2014 not al- Qaida, Russia \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 unless you're still stuck in a Cold War mind warp. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nYou might not be ready for diplomacy with Beijing if you can't visit the Olympics without insulting our closest ally.\n\n(Laughter, cheers, applause.)\n\nMy opponent \u2014 my opponent said that it was tragic to end the war in Iraq. And he won't tell us how he'll end the war in Afghanistan. Well, I have, and I will. (Cheers, applause.) And while my opponent would spend more money on military hardware that our Joint Chiefs don't even want, I will use the money we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work \u2014 (extended cheers, applause) \u2014 rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and runways, because after two wars that have cost us thousands of lives and over a trillion dollars, it's time to do some nation building right here at home. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nYou can choose a future where we reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class. (Cheers, applause.) Independent experts say that my plan would cut our deficit by $4 trillion. (Cheers.) And last summer I worked with Republicans in Congress to cut a billion dollars in spending, because those of us who believe government can be a force for good should work harder than anyone to reform it so that it's leaner and more efficient and more responsive to the American people. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nI want to reform the tax code so that it's simple, fair and asks the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over $250,000 \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 the same rate we had when Bill Clinton was president, the same rate we had when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs, the biggest surplus in history and a whole lot of millionaires to boot.\n\n(Applause.)\n\nNow, I'm still eager to reach an agreement based on the principles of my bipartisan debt commission. No party has a monopoly on wisdom. No democracy works without compromise. I want to get this done, and we can get it done.\n\nBut when Governor Romney and his friends in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficits by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy, well \u2014 (boos) \u2014 what'd Bill Clinton call it? You do the arithmetic. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) You do the math.\n\nI refuse to go along with that, and as long as I'm president, I never will. (Cheers, applause.) I refuse to ask middle-class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut. (Cheers, applause.) I refuse to ask students to pay more for college or kick children out of Head Start programs to eliminate health insurance for millions of Americans who are poor and elderly or disabled all so those with the most can pay less. I'm not going along with that. (Continued cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd I will never \u2014 I will never turn Medicare into a voucher. (Cheers, applause.) No American should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies. They should retire with the care and the dignity that they have earned. Yes, we will reform and strengthen Medicare for the long haul, but we'll do it by reducing the cost of health care, not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more.\n\n(Cheers, applause.) And we will keep the promise of Social Security by taking the responsible steps to strengthen it, not by turning it over to Wall Street. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nThis is the choice we now face. This is what the election comes down to. Over and over, we've been told by our opponents that bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations are the only way, that since government can't do everything, it should do almost nothing. If you can't afford health insurance, hope that you don't get sick. (Murmurs of disapproval.) If a company releases toxic pollution into the air your children breathe, well, that's the price of progress. If you can't afford to start a business or go to college, take my opponent's advice and borrow money from your parents. (Laughter, mixed cheers and boos, applause.)\n\nYou know what, that's not who we are. That's not what this country is about. As Americans, we believe we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, rights that no man or government can take away. We insist on personal responsibility, and we celebrate individual initiative. We're not entitled to success. We have to earn it. We honor the strivers, the dreamers, the risk- takers, the entrepreneurs who have always been the driving force behind our free enterprise system, the greatest engine of growth and prosperity that the world's ever known.\n\nBut we also believe in something called citizenship \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 citizenship, a word at the very heart of our founding, a word at the very essence of our democracy, the idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations.\n\nWe believe that when a CEO pays his autoworkers enough to buy the cars that they build, the whole company does better. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nWe believe that when a family can no longer be tricked into signing a mortgage they can't afford, that family's protected, but so is the value of other people's homes \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 and so is the entire economy. (Applause.)\n\nWe believe the little girl who's offered an escape from poverty by a great teacher or a grant for college could become the next Steve Jobs or the scientist who cures cancer or the president of the United States \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 and it is in our power to give her that chance. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nWe know that churches and charities can often make more of a difference than a poverty program alone. We don't want handouts for people who refuse to help themselves, and we certainly don't want bailouts for banks that break the rules. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nWe don't think the government can solve all of our problems, but we don't think the government is the source of all of our problems \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 any more than our welfare recipients or corporations or unions or immigrants or gays or any other group we're told to blame for our troubles \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 because \u2014 because America, we understand that this democracy is ours.\n\nWe, the people \u2014 (cheers) \u2014 recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which asks only, what's in it for me, a freedom without a commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals, and those who died in their defense. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAs citizens, we understand that America is not about what can be done for us. It's about what can be done by us, together \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self-government. That's what we believe.\n\nSo you see, the election four years ago wasn't about me. It was about you. (Cheers, applause.) My fellow citizens \u2014 you were the change. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nYou're the reason there's a little girl with a heart disorder in Phoenix who'll get the surgery she needs because an insurance company can't limit her coverage. You did that. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nYou're the reason a young man in Colorado who never thought he'd be able to afford his dream of earning a medical degree is about to get that chance. You made that possible. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nYou're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 why selfless soldiers won't be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love, why thousands of families have finally been able to say to the loved ones who served us so bravely, welcome home. (Cheers, applause.) Welcome home. You did that. You did that. (Cheers, applause.) You did that.\n\nIf you turn away now \u2014 if you turn away now, if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for isn't possible, well, change will not happen. If you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference, then other voices will fill the void, the lobbyists and special interests, the people with the $10 million checks who are trying to buy this election and those who are trying to make it harder for you to vote, Washington politicians who want to decide who you can marry or control health care choices that women should be making for themselves. (Cheers, applause.) Only you can make sure that doesn't happen. Only you have the power to move us forward.\n\nYou know, I recognize that times have changed since I first spoke to this convention. Times have changed, and so have I. I'm no longer just a candidate. I'm the president. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and that's --\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Four more years! Four more years!\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: And that \u2014 and that means I know what it means to send young Americans into battle, for I've held in my arms the mothers and fathers of those who didn't return.\n\nI've shared the pain of families who've lost their homes, and the frustration of workers who've lost their jobs. If the critics are right that I've made all my decisions based on polls, then I must not be very good at reading them. (Laughter.)\n\nAnd while I'm proud of what we've achieved together \u2014 (cheers) \u2014 I'm far more mindful of my own failings, knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said, \"I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go.\" , for I have held in my arms the mothers and fathers of those who didn't return. I've shared the pain of families who've lost their homes, and the frustration of workers who've lost their jobs. If the critics are right that I've made all my decisions based on polls, then I must not be very good at reading them. And while I'm proud of what we've achieved together, I'm far more mindful of my own failings, knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said, \"I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go.\" (Cheers, applause.)\n\nBut as I stand here tonight, I have never been more hopeful about America. (Cheers, applause.) Not because I think I have all the answers. Not because I'm naive about the magnitude of our challenges.\n\nI'm hopeful because of you.\n\nThe young woman I met at a science fair who won national recognition for her biology research while living with her family at a homeless shelter \u2014 she gives me hope. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nThe auto worker who won the lottery after his plant almost closed, but kept coming to work every day, and bought flags for his whole town and one of the cars that he built to surprise his wife \u2014 he gives me hope.\n\n(Cheers, applause.)\n\nThe family business in Warroad, Minnesota, that didn't lay off a single one of their 4,000 employees when the recession hit \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 even when their competitors shut down dozens of plants, even when it meant the owner gave up some perks and some pay because they understood that their biggest asset was the community and the workers who had helped build that business \u2014 they give me hope. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nI think about the young sailor I met at Walter Reed Hospital still recovering from a grenade attack that would cause him to have his leg amputated above the knee. And six months ago we would watch him walk into a White House dinner honoring those who served in Iran (sic; Iraq) \u2014 tall and 20 pounds heavier, dashing in his uniform, with a big grin on his face, sturdy on his new leg. And I remember how a few months after that I would watch him on a bicycle, racing with his fellow wounded warriors on a sparkling spring day, inspiring other heroes who had just begun the hard path he had traveled. He gives me hope. (Cheers, applause.) He gives me hope.\n\nI don't know what party these men and women belong to. I don't know if they'll vote for me. But I know that their spirit defines us. They remind me, in the words of Scripture, that ours is a future filled with hope. (Cheers.) And if you share that faith with me, if you share that hope with me, I ask you tonight for your vote.\n\n(Cheers, applause.)\n\nIf you reject the notion that this nation's promise is reserved for the few, your voice must be heard in this election. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nIf you reject the notion that our government is forever beholden to the highest bidder, you need to stand up in this election. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nIf you believe that new plants and factories can dot our landscape, that new energy can power our future, that new schools can provide ladders of opportunity to this nation of dreamers, if you believe in a country where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same rules, then I need you to vote this November. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAmerica, I never said this journey would be easy, and I won't promise that now. Yes, our path is harder, but it leads to a better place. (Cheers.) Yes, our road is longer, but we travel it together. (Cheers.)\n\nWe don't turn back. We leave no one behind. (Cheers.) We pull each other up. (Cheers, applause.) We draw strength from our victories. (Cheers, applause.) And we learn from our mistakes. But we keep our eyes fixed on that distant horizon knowing that providence is with us and that we are surely blessed to be citizens of the greatest nation on earth.\n\nThank you, God bless you and God bless these United States. (Cheers, applause.)\n\n=== tishaura_jones_2021_inaugural_address.txt ===\nTitle: Inaugural Address by Mayor Tishaura Jones\nSpeaker: Mayor Tishaura O. Jones\nDate: April 20, 2021\nEvent: Mayoral Inauguration Ceremony\nLocation: St. Louis City Hall, St. Louis, Missouri\nSource: YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHwUGuV_doc (live stream)\nChannel: KSDK News\nDuration: Approximately 20 minutes (extracted from 118-minute ceremony at t=5250)\nHistorical Significance: Historic inaugural address by Tishaura Jones upon becoming the first Black woman mayor of St. Louis, Missouri. Notable for its comprehensive vision of equity, inclusion, and progressive reform addressing systemic racism, public safety reform, and economic justice. Delivered during a pivotal moment in American urban politics following nationwide protests for racial justice.\n\n---\n\nThank you. Love you too. Good afternoon, St. Louis. My name is Tishaura Jones.\n\nLet me back up because I got to pay honor to my mama. My name is Tishaura Onita Jones. My pronouns are she, her, hers. I am the daughter of Lara and Vervis, sister to Chelsea and Ida, mother of Aiden, daughter of Walnut Park, Wells Goodfellow, and Hamilton Heights neighborhoods. And because of you, I am the mayor of the city of St. Louis.\n\nSometimes when I stop and think about it, I'm overwhelmed with disbelief that today's events are real. I keep pinching myself - did that really happen? Today serves as a reminder of what our city can be when we summon the best within ourselves and come together around a positive vision of change and opportunity for all in our city.\n\nMy thoughts also return to this building when a community activist arrived with his wife and nine-year-old daughter in tow. She was a scrawny little thing with hair in two pigtails. Well, that little girl was me, and that activist was Vervis Jones. And 40 years ago tomorrow, he was sworn in as the first Black alderman from the 27th Ward in the city of St. Louis.\n\nI'm aware, as I'm sure the comptroller, the president of the board, and many of our citywide elected leaders can also attest, that I am standing on stone that was not built for me. I am speaking in a rotunda that never envisioned my ascent to mayor. I'm going to walk into an office that my ancestors could have never imagined me working in. But I'm here.\n\nI'm here today because of my grandparents who migrated from the Jim Crow South in search of a better life for their children, my parents and their siblings. Eddie and Daisy Whitfield migrated from Louisiana and Mississippi, and Charlie and Angeline Greene came from Tennessee and Mississippi.\n\nI'm here today because of my parents, Vervis and Lara, who raised their only child in North St. Louis and Walnut Park, in South St. Louis and Shaw, whose families lived in Hamilton Heights, Wells Goodfellow, and East St. Louis, Illinois.\n\nI'm here today as a product of the voluntary desegregation program, which bused me from North St. Louis to the Affton School District from fifth grade until I graduated from high school.\n\nI'm here today as the proud graduate of Hampton University, one of the oldest historically Black colleges and universities in the country, or otherwise affectionately known by its graduates as \"our home by the sea.\"\n\nI'm here as a proud graduate of St. Louis University School of Public Health. I'm here today as a proud participant of Harvard University's Executives in State and Local Government. I'm here today as the proud alum of the Aspen Institute Rodel Fellowship, the Council of State Governments' Henry Toll Fellowship, and a New Deal Leader.\n\nI'm here today as a proud member of the St. Louis Metropolitan Alumni Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated.\n\nI'm here today as the proud chairwoman of the 2020 Bipartisan Justice Center and the chair of the newly formed Black Bank Fund. I'm here today as a former legislator, assistant minority floor leader, and city treasurer. I'm here today as the proud single mother of the most adorable 13-year-old son, Aiden, who, by the way - he's looking - could not be bothered to be here today.\n\nAnd I'm here today as the proud big sister of Ida Victoria and Chelsea Alexis. And most importantly, I'm here today because of you - because you voted, because you got involved, and because you chose to be inspired by a movement of people and a vision for St. Louis seeking to move our city and our region forward.\n\nWhen I announced that I was running for mayor, I said that whether you lived in Penrose or Holly Hills, South Broadway or Natural Bridge, I wanted to be your mayor. I wanted to be the people's mayor. My commitment to you is that I will be a mayor for you and your family, whether you supported me or not.\n\nMost St. Louisans share some core desires, and as a single mom, I know these desires well myself. I want to raise my son in a safe neighborhood. I want him to receive a quality education. I want him to be able to envision himself safely raising a family in St. Louis one day as well.\n\nWe want all our children to grow and learn and develop, to play in the dirt, to run around outside, occasionally scrape their knee on the concrete or slide, or make mistakes, and sometimes stay out too late. Unfortunately, our city has not always protected our children. We have not always fought for every neighborhood. And often, those neighborhoods just off Natural Bridge or South Broadway, and the people who live there, have been forgotten and left behind.\n\nI stand here before you today resolved to make change, to transform our city, and to transform our approach to safety. I stand ready to begin putting equity for people - not equity for wealthy developers - at the center of our planning, in the center of our development. Development is crucial to the success of our city, but we cannot abandon our most precious resource, our people, in exchange for handouts to the rich and well-connected.\n\nBut I am not naive in my pursuit of progressive public policy. I am aware that I am walking into an office that is tasked with working to solve some of our most pressing challenges: lack of opportunity for our most vulnerable, a broken criminal justice system, and a fractured region. I ask for grace as my team and I work to combat decades upon decades of disinvestment.\n\nOur city stands at a pivotal moment in our history. The decisions we make for the next four years, during my first term as mayor, will begin to chart the course for our future. Decades of problems will not be solved by days or months of solutions. And my colleague to the west, the north, and the south, County Executive Sam Page, put it like this when we met with him and his staff last week: sometimes when addressing an incredible challenge, it takes six months to see progress and a year to see real change.\n\nMy team and I have collected input from the people of the city of St. Louis to inform our first steps in re-envisioning and re-imagining public safety, reforming our broken and regressive tax system, working to eradicate and finally dismiss the powerful forces of racism and inequity that have held us back.\n\nThe work ahead of us will be challenging. It will not be easy, and the conversations will not be comfortable. But Vice President Kamala Harris frequently says that our dreams of what we can be cannot be burdened by what we have been.\n\nMoving forward, I will make it my task and mandate to begin convening my partners in city government, our leaders to the west and the east, and you, the people of St. Louis, to have the tough and uncomfortable conversations. We should ask ourselves: Why is it that our politics is so divisive? Why does racism become magnified during an election year, even as it rides the underbelly of strategic messaging? Why do we live in a city whose police department is supposedly understaffed but is larger than any other city our size? Do people who look like me and my son and my dad have a life expectancy that is a fraction of our white neighbors?\n\nBeginning to answer these questions will be crucial to our shared success. When we realize that the success of Black communities and white communities, and the success of Hispanic and Asian communities, and the success of Muslim and Jewish communities, and the success of our gay and straight and trans communities, and the success of all of our communities are linked, we will move forward.\n\nWe will move forward when we recognize our shared humanity, our shared core desires, and our common resolve to make our city a better, safer, and healthier place to live.\n\nHere's my dream for St. Louis. It's ambitious, but it's possible. Our children will play as I did when I was a child - riding bikes around the neighborhood, playing double dutch and hopscotch, laughing with friends, going to good quality schools. Our communities will be rich and prosperous from north to south. They will be hubs of culture, opportunity, access to jobs, health care, and education.\n\nOur public safety department will be staffed with many types of professionals so that when you call 911, you get the right professional most capable of meeting your needs. Our COVID-19 vaccine will get into as many arms as possible, and our outreach to the vaccine-hesitant communities will take priority. Our recovery from the crisis we are facing will be equitable and people-focused.\n\nMy dream is for a public discourse that is characterized by debates of public policy and not debates of personality. So yes, you may say that I, like Dr. King, did have a dream. I have a dream that I know that we can achieve.\n\nI have a dream that my son - I have a dream that your son and daughter and your non-binary child will be judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin or their expression of gender or the way in which they love.\n\nI have a dream that St. Louis will break the chains that have held us back and build a new St. Louis - a St. Louis that is strong, confident, equitable, united, and inclusive.\n\nI have a dream that one day we will rise to new heights of freedom and equity. We instill new faith in those who have been knocked down but have refused to be knocked out, that their government is working for them.\n\nAmanda Gorman, a young woman who delivered the poem at President Biden's inauguration, said this: \"And yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge a union with purpose, to compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters, and conditions of man.\"\n\nAnd so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. St. Louis, there is a challenge before us, but I know that together we will solve it. The forces of good will always shut down and shut out the forces of evil. Light will drive out darkness. Love will overcome hate.\n\nI'm ready to get to work. So to any single mother wondering how they make ends meet, I have seen you, and I'm ready to work for you. To those in our city who are looking to city hall for help, I've seen you, and I'm ready to work for you. To the LGBTQ+ youth who wonder whether St. Louis is a home for them, I have seen you, and I'm ready to work for you. To all of you, I have seen you, and I'm ready to serve.\n\nMy name is Tishaura Onita Jones. I use the she/her pronouns, and I am the mayor of the city of St. Louis.\n\nI'm ready to serve you. God bless you. God bless St. Louis. Thank you very much.",

Thank you for coming here on this beautiful Arizona evening. [Applause] \n\nMy friends, we have come to the end of a long journey. The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. A little while ago, I had the honor of calling Senator Barack Obama to congratulate him - please - to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love.\n\nIn a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.\n\nThis is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight. I've always believed that America offers opportunities to all who have the industry and will to seize it. Senator Obama believes that too. But we both recognize that though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still had the power to wound.\n\nA century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt's invitation of Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House was taken as an outrage in many quarters. America today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than the election of an African-American to the presidency of the United States. [Applause]\n\nLet there be no reason now for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth. Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country. I applaud him for it, and offer him my sincere sympathy that his beloved grandmother did not live to see this day, though our faith assures us she is at rest in the presence of her Creator and so very proud of the good man she helped raise.\n\nSenator Obama and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country, and I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face.\n\nI urge all Americans - I urge all Americans who supported me to join me in not just congratulating him, but offering our next president our good will and earnest effort to find ways to come together, to find the necessary compromises to bridge our differences and help restore our prosperity, defend our security in a dangerous world, and leave our children and grandchildren a stronger, better country than we inherited.\n\nWhatever our differences, we are fellow Americans, and please believe me when I say no association has ever meant more to me than that. [Applause]\n\nIt is natural tonight to feel some disappointment, but tomorrow we must move beyond it and work together to get our country moving again. We fought - we fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.\n\nI am so deeply grateful to all of you for the great honor of your support and for all you have done for me. I wish the outcome had been different, my friends. The road was a difficult one from the outset, but your support and friendship never wavered. I cannot adequately express how deeply indebted I am to you.\n\nI'm especially grateful to my wife Cindy, my children, my dear mother, and all my family, and to the many old and dear friends who have stood by my side through the many ups and downs of this long campaign. I have always been a fortunate man, and never more so for the love and encouragement you have given me.\n\nYou know, campaigns are often harder on a candidate's family than on the candidate, and that's been true in this campaign. All I can offer in compensation is my love and gratitude and the promise of more peaceful years ahead.\n\nI am also, of course, very thankful to Governor Sarah Palin - one of the best campaigners I have ever seen and an impressive new voice in our party for reform and the principles that have always been our greatest strength. Her husband Todd and their five beautiful children, for their tireless dedication to our cause and the courage and grace they showed in the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign. We can all look forward with great interest to her future service to Alaska, the Republican Party, and our country.\n\nTo all my campaign comrades, from Rick Davis and Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter to every last volunteer who fought so hard and valiantly month after month in what at times seemed to be the most challenging campaign in modern times - thank you so much. A lost election will never mean more to me than the privilege of your faith and friendship.\n\nI don't know what more we could have done to try to win this election. I'll leave that to others to determine. Every candidate makes mistakes, and I'm sure I made my share of them. But I won't spend a moment of the future regretting what might have been.\n\nThis campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life, and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that Senator Obama and my old friend Senator Joe Biden should have the honor of leading us for the next four years.\n\n[Please, please] I would not be an American worthy of the name should I regret a fate that has allowed me the extraordinary privilege of serving this country for a half a century. Today I was a candidate for the highest office in the country I love so much, and tonight I remain her servant. That is blessing enough for anyone, and I thank the people of Arizona for it.\n\nTonight - tonight more than any night - I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or Senator Obama. I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president, and I call on all Americans, as I have often in this campaign, to not despair of our present difficulties, but to believe always in the promise and greatness of America.\n\nBecause nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.\n\nThank you, and God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all very much.\n\n[Applause]\n\n=== larry_hogan_2023_giia_infrastructure_speech.txt ===\nTITLE: US Infrastructure Champion Governor Larry Hogan Addresses GIIA Board Members\nSPEAKER: Larry Hogan\nROLE: Former Governor of Maryland, Former Chairman of National Governors Association  \nDATE: December 2023\nVENUE: Global Infrastructure Investor Association Board Meeting\nSOURCE: Global Infrastructure Investor Association\nURL: https://giia.net/news/us-infrastructure-champion-governor-larry-hogan-addresses-giia-board-members\nCLASSIFICATION: Conservative Dignity\nFRAMEWORK_QUADRANT: Conservative/Dignity\nVALIDATION_STUDY: Civic Virtue Framework - Dignity vs Tribalism Dimension\nEXTRACTED: December 2024\n\n===== SPEECH CONTENT =====\n\n\"Modernizing America's infrastructure won't happen without modernizing the way we finance infrastructure.\"\n\nSince the passage of the bipartisan Infrastructure Bill and the Inflation Reduction act, the time to invest in American infrastructure projects, in my opinion, has never been better. And I'm hopeful that many of the successes that we've already achieved together are just the beginning of a public private partnership revolution in the United States.\n\nIt's about time that we brought the United States in line with the rest of the world.\n\nWhen we took office, our roads and bricks were crumbling. We launched an infrastructure initiative all across the state, taking a balanced, all-inclusive approach to infrastructure investment. I'm proud that we made Maryland into both a national and an international leader, in using innovative solutions to address pressing infrastructure concerns. We moved forward on nearly all of our state's highest priority transportation projects in every single jurisdiction.\n\nAll across our state we made record investments in roads, bridges, tunnels, transit systems, ports and airports. We replaced and repaired every structurally deficient bridge. We resurfaced nearly 100% of the entire state highway system.\n\nAs one of the first governors of America to embrace P3s for infrastructure, one thing that we realized was that both state, and particularly local issues and interests, often created more of a headache for investments than national politics did. Many times we found that having partners who knew how to navigate state local government entities were some of the most valuable allies in trying to get large infrastructure projects approved.\n\nSo we incorporated state and local advisors into the working group that could anticipate concerns raised by hyper local interests, that could easily derail or delay projects. After a year-long effort, I got all 50 governors to agree on a series of recommendations, including four main pillars.\n\nFirst was to relieve congestion to boost economic competitiveness. We insisted that the states be granted maximum flexibility to relieve congestion and to invest in adaptable and innovative solutions.\n\nSecond, enhancing efficiency by eliminating red tape and integrating smart technology. We pushed for a two-year goal for completion of environmental reviews and a 90-day timeline for related project authorizations.\n\nThird, we focused on protecting America's critical infrastructure against not only traditional threats, but also emerging cyber threats. We recommended that Congress make investments in both resiliency and security.\n\nAnd fourth, and in my opinion the most important and most impactful, was to advocate for the financing of infrastructure projects through private sector investment.\n\nWe stressed that states needed maximum flexibility to harness the full potential of the private sector to be a part of America's infrastructure future and through P3s. Government - whether federal, state or local - simply cannot afford what it will take to address all the gaps that exist in our collective investment in American infrastructure.\n\nEach of these pillars and nearly all of our recommendations were included in the final Infrastructure Bill, which passed through Congress with bipartisan support.\n\nOften times, when I was NGA Chairman, I would meet with governors across the country, both Republicans and Democrats, who frankly knew very little about private financing for infrastructure. It's important for potential investors to know that some of the biggest decision makers in America are often times state and local politicians and bureaucrats, who are still not yet sold on the benefits of P3s and infrastructure financing.\n\nI still believe that America's best days are ahead, and we have shown the path to modernizing America's infrastructure. It starts with modernizing the way we finance our infrastructure projects. America is a country that was founded on innovative solutions and a spirit of optimism. I firmly believe that what we've started together is blazing a trail for others to follow.\n\nNow it's time for us to just get the rest of America on board.\n\nState, local governments and the federal government are not going to be able to accomplish all the things, no matter how much money they try to invest. They're finding they're running out of funds. People are tightening their belts rather than investing more in some cases, which is all the more reason why we need to tap into the vast amount of private sector money that's willing to invest in infrastructure.\n\nThe last thing any politician, whether they're progressive, Democrat or conservative, probably wants to do is raise taxes. And when they have revenue shortfalls and increasing expenditures and capital needs, I think there's never going to be an easier time to persuade them that, hey, we have a solution.\n\n=== mitt_romney_2020_impeachment_vote.txt ===\n**Mitt Romney - Senate Floor Speech on Impeachment Vote**\n\n**Bibliographic Information:**\n- **Speaker:** Mitt Romney, U.S. Senator from Utah\n- **Event:** Senate Impeachment Trial of President Donald Trump\n- **Speech Type:** Impeachment Vote Explanation\n- **Date:** February 5, 2020\n- **Location:** U.S. Senate Chamber, Washington, D.C.\n- **Context:** Speech explaining his vote to convict President Trump on abuse of power charges\n- **Source:** C-SPAN (YouTube Archive)\n- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wf9ilAfJ-c\n- **Duration:** 8 minutes 30 seconds\n- **Views:** Over 60,000\n- **Classification:** Conservative Dignity (Validation Set)\n- **Historical Significance:** Romney became the first senator in U.S. history to vote to convict a president of his own party, demonstrating constitutional principle over partisan loyalty. A defining moment of conservative conscience and institutional integrity.\n\n---\n\nMr. President, Senator from Utah. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nThe Constitution is at the foundation of our Republic's success, and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it. The Constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of our Congress these many days. We have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it. We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.\n\nThe House managers presented evidence supporting their case, and the White House counsel disputed that case. In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, the Bidens' conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office. To maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders Congress powerless to remove such a president defies reason.\n\nThe president's counsel also notes that Vice President Biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the Ukrainian prosecutor general. If he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation, the Vice President should have recused himself. While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit. There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.\n\nThe defense argues that the Senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters. While that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts, it is inconsistent with the Constitution's requirement that the Senate, not the voters, try the president. Hamilton explained that the founders' decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to the voters was intended to minimize, to the extent possible, the partisan sentiments of the public at large. So the verdict is ours to render under our Constitution. The people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfill our duty.\n\nThe grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did.\n\nThe president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival. The president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so. The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian invaders. The president's purpose was personal and political. Accordingly, the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\n\nWhat he did was not perfect. No, it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security, and our fundamental values. Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\n\nIn the last several weeks, I've received numerous calls and texts. Many demanded, in their words, that I \"stand with the team.\" I can assure you that that thought has been very much in my mind. You see, I support a great deal of what the president has done. I voted with him 80% of the time. But my promise before God to apply impartial justice required that I put my personal feelings and political biases aside.\n\nWere I to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience.\n\nI'm aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters I will be vehemently denounced. I'm sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe that I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\n\nI sought to hear testimony from John Bolton not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.\n\nLike each member of this deliberative body, I love our country. I believe that our Constitution was inspired by Providence. I'm convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character. As it is with each senator, my vote is an act of conviction. We've come to different conclusions, fellow senators, but I trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience.\n\nI acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office. The results of this Senate court will, in fact, be appealed to a higher court: the judgment of the American people. Voters will make the final decision, just as the president's lawyers have implored. My vote will likely be in the minority in the Senate. But irrespective of these things, with my vote, I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nI will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial. They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong - grievously wrong.\n\nWe are all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that distinction is enough for any citizen.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n=== rick_perry_2016_alec_speech.txt ===\nTitle: Remarks by Governor Rick Perry at the American Legislative Exchange Council Annual Meeting\nSpeaker: Governor Rick Perry\nDate: August 4, 2016\nEvent: American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) Annual Meeting\nLocation: United States (location not specified)\nSource: YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9T_ZQtxlWxs\nChannel: American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)\nDuration: 39 minutes 47 seconds\nHistorical Significance: Governor Perr's comprehensive address on conservative approaches to criminal justice reform and racial justice, arguing for how Republicans can better serve African American communities through policy reform rather than rhetoric. Notable for its frank discussion of historical racial injustice and concrete policy prescriptions on criminal justice reform, education, and economic opportunity.\n\n---\n\nI want to spend some time with you today talking about the most pressing issue of our time for people like you and me, for people who share our values, for people all across this state and across this country.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not the election. Though believe me, I have opinions about that too. But it\u2019s about something that is affecting this election, and will affect much more than this election if we don\u2019t do something about it.\n\nWhen Ronald Reagan left office in 1989, America knew\u2014and the world knew\u2014the value of individual liberty and limited government. Whether you lived in East Berlin, Germany or East Bernard, Texas\u2014whether you were a multi-generation Texan or an immigrant from Vietnam\u2014you knew that conservative principles would make your life better, and those of the people around you.\n\nBut most Americans in their twenties weren\u2019t even alive when Ronald Reagan was President. The reason we\u2019ve had the political year we\u2019ve had is because fewer Americans remember how well liberty can serve them and their families.\n\nAs everyone here at ALEC knows, the conservative movement is thriving in dozens of states, including my beloved Texas. But at the national level\u2014at the level of the electoral college\u2014we\u2019re losing. We can blame bad politicians all we want for that fact. We can blame the media for always stacking the deck against us.\n\nBut here is a truth that we in this room have to confront: Winners don\u2019t make excuses. We haven\u2019t done enough to show people who don\u2019t share our views why they should come over to our side.\n\nWe conservatives are really good at talking to each other about what\u2019s wrong. We\u2019re really good at preaching to the converted. But we\u2019re not so good at reaching out to those who disagree, and winning them over.\n\nForbes Daily: Join over 1 million Forbes Daily subscribers and get our best stories, exclusive reporting and essential analysis of the day\u2019s news in your inbox every weekday.\n\nGet the latest news on special offers, product updates and content suggestions from Forbes and its affiliates.\n\nDuring my 14 years as Governor of Texas, we did a lot of good things. We passed historic tax relief. And I was proud to sign balanced budgets for each of those 14 years. The economic growth that followed helped every Texan, rich or poor. Texas companies created almost one-third of all new American jobs. Texas now leads the nation in exports.\n\nTexas\u2019 high school graduation rate went from 27th in the country in 2003, to 2nd in the country in 2013. Our most recent graduation rate for African-Americans is number one in the nation: 13 points higher than the national average. That matters, because kids who graduate from high school typically make 50 percent more than those who don\u2019t.\n\nThe record is clear. Our policies have made life better for all Texans: those at the top, and those at the bottom. So why is it that our movement continues to do so poorly with minorities? In the 2014 Texas governor\u2019s race, my good friend Greg Abbott crushed Wendy Davis. But Wendy Davis won the black vote 93 to 7.\n\nAgain, we can blame the left. We can blame political correctness. We can blame those who gin up resentment, who find grievance at every turn.\n\nI have an alternative explanation. But first, I have to tell you a story of something that happened one hundred years and two months ago, at a courthouse in McLennan County, Texas.\n\nJesse Washington\u2019s story\n\nOn May 15, 1916, in Waco, a mentally disabled 17-year-old boy named Jesse Washington was convicted of raping and murdering the wife of his employer.\n\nHe pled guilty and was sentenced to death. But Jesse died no ordinary death\u2014because he was black.\n\nAfter the death sentence was issued, Jesse was dragged out of the McLennan County Courthouse and into a crowd of hundreds.\n\nThanks to the advent of a new technology called the telephone, word quickly spread as to what was about to happen\u2026and soon 15,000 people were watching Jesse Washington be tortured, mutilated, and tied over the branch of a tree.\n\nSomeone lit a fire under Jesse, and raised him up into the air.\n\nJesse tried to climb up the chains to avoid the fire.\n\nSomeone started cutting off Jesse\u2019s fingers, so he couldn\u2019t keep climbing.\n\nOne man castrated him, while another used a pole to prevent Jesse from escaping the fire.\n\nA prominent local photographer took pictures of Jesse\u2019s charred remains and sold them: as souvenirs, on postcards.\n\nProgress and pitfalls\n\nWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress since 1916.\n\nA half-century ago, Republicans and Democrats came together to finally enshrine in law the principle that all of us\u2014regardless of race, color, or national origin\u2014are created equal.\n\nWhen it comes to race, America is a better and more tolerant and more welcoming place than it has ever been. We are a country with Hispanic CEOs, and Asian billionaires, and a black President.\n\nThat\u2019s why the story of Ericka Jean Dockery is so troubling.\n\nEricka was a single mother of three who worked two jobs to support her children: during the days as a home health aide, and at nights making sandwiches at Subway. In April 2003, she was hauled before a grand jury, because her boyfriend, Alfred Dewayne Brown, had been suspected of murdering a police officer during a burglary.\n\nEricka told the grand jury that Alfred couldn\u2019t have committed the murder, because he was asleep on her couch on the morning of the murder, and had even called her from the landline phone in her home. \u201cIf he did it,\u201d she said, \u201che deserves to get whatever is coming to him. Truly.\u201d\n\nBut neither the prosecutor nor the grand jury would accept her explanation. They threatened to separate her from her children if she didn\u2019t turn her boyfriend in. \u201cYou know,\u201d said the foreman, \u201cthe kids are going to be taken by Child Protective Services, and you\u2019re going to the penitentiary and you won\u2019t see your kids for a long time.\u201d\n\nEventually, Ericka told a different story\u2014that she had left her house earlier that night, and that she wasn\u2019t sure if Alfred had been on her couch at the time of the murder.\n\nThe Harris County prosecutor, Dan Rizzo, decided to charge Ericka with perjury, and locked her up for four months in the county jail, away from her young children. Rizzo told her that they would only release her from jail if she said definitively that her boyfriend hadn\u2019t been in her home. Ericka, distraught over being away from her kids, said that Alfred had admitted to her that he had murdered the police officer.\n\nIn exchange for this testimony, the prosecutors released Ericka from jail, on the condition that she wear an ankle monitor, and call a homicide detective once a week. At Alfred\u2019s trial in 2005, she testified that Alfred had told her that he \u201cwas there\u201d when the police officer was murdered.\n\nAlfred Dwayne Brown was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.\n\nSeven years after Alfred\u2019s conviction, a reporter for the Houston Chronicle reported that Ericka\u2019s phone records were found in the garage of a homicide detective, indicating that Alfred had indeed called Ericka from her apartment phone at the time of the murder, confirming her initial story. For reasons unknown, the prosecution never made those records available during Alfred\u2019s trial.\n\nAfter a delay of more than a year, the judge in the case agreed to a new trial. In 2015, Alfred was released from death row.\n\nYou could say this story has a happy ending, because Alfred was released. But his life was almost ruined because of an overzealous prosecutor who concealed exonerating evidence. And Ericka\u2019s children were put in harm\u2019s way because of a grand jury that acted as the arm of the prosecution, rather than as an independent check on government power.\n\nSometimes we forget that the IRS isn\u2019t the only government agency capable of abusing its authority. Anyone wielding the power of the state faces the temptation to abuse it. And when it comes to prosecutors, there are clearly bad apples in the system who care more about indicting someone\u2014anyone\u2014than they care about convicting the right person.\n\nYou may know that I was indicted in 2014 on two frivolous felony charges. Eventually, those charges were dismissed, because I was lucky enough to have high-powered lawyers working for me.\n\nEricka Jean Dockery had no such luxury. When ambitious prosecutors go overboard, the true victims aren\u2019t people like you or me: they\u2019re people like Ericka and Alfred who don\u2019t have the means to fight back.\n\nAfrican-Americans lack confidence in our justice system\n\nI hope these stories help explain why even today, so many African-Americans lack confidence in the fairness of our justice system.\n\nAnd, by the way, African-Americans don\u2019t just struggle in our courts.\n\nAfter two decades of declining violent crimes in our cities, we\u2019re losing ground. According to a study by the Washington Post, homicides in our fifty largest cities are up 17 percent in the last year: the largest increase in a quarter century.\n\nA quarter of African-Americans live below the poverty line\u2026even after the impact of federal programs like food stamps and housing subsidies. The supplemental poverty rate for African-Americans is nearly double the rate for other Americans.\n\nDemocrats have long had the opportunity to govern in African-American communities.\n\nIt is time to help black families hold them accountable for the results.\n\nI am here to tell you that it is Republicans\u2014not Democrats\u2014who are truly offering black Americans the hope of a better life for themselves and their children.\n\nWhere Democrats govern, blacks are falling further behind\n\nI am proud to live in a country with an African-American President.\n\nBut President Obama cannot be proud of his record on improving black lives.\n\nEarlier this month, the President spoke at a memorial service for the five police officers gunned down in Dallas. As families and friends mourned, the President said that we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that, quote, \u201ctensions boil over,\u201d because we don\u2019t spend enough on government programs. The President blamed you\u2014and all other Americans\u2014for \u201callow[ing] poverty to fester\u201d in urban communities. The President couldn\u2019t resist injecting a political lecture into a moment that should have been apart from politics.\n\nBut that day in Dallas, the President showed us something else, something worse: that if he and Hillary Clinton get their way, African-Americans will be worse off than they are today.\n\nOverwhelmingly, the cities where the left-wing solutions have been tried over and over again\u2014places like Detroit and Chicago and Baltimore\u2014African-Americans are falling further behind.\n\nIn 2010, President Obama enacted the largest expansion of the welfare state in 50 years. And yet, the prevalence of black poverty has actually increased under his leadership.\n\nWe cannot dismiss the historical legacy of slavery\u2014nor its role in causing the problem of black poverty.\n\nAnd because slavery and segregation were sanctioned by government, there is a role for government policy in addressing their lasting effects.\n\nBut the specific policies enacted by President Obama and advanced by Hillary Clinton amount to little more than throwing money at the problem and walking away.\n\nWe spend $450 billion a year on Medicaid, and yet health outcomes for those on Medicaid are no better than for those with no insurance at all. Instead of reforming Medicaid, the President expanded it under Obamacare.\n\nMr. President, I say with the greatest respect: It is you who has allowed poverty to fester in the African-American community. It is you who has trapped black children in failing schools. And it is you who has made African-Americans less safe.\n\nPolice bias is a real problem\n\nThe President\u2014and the Black Lives Matter movement he supports\u2014never acknowledge the incredible gains achieved by the police on behalf of African-Americans.\n\nThanks to leaders like Rudy Giuliani and Ray Kelly in New York, thousands of blacks are not killed by criminals each year. Those black lives matter too.\n\nBut we cannot dismiss the experience of men like my good friend Senator Tim Scott, who said the other day that he \u201cdid not know many African American men who do not have a\u2026story to tell, no matter the profession, no matter their income, no matter their disposition in life,\u201d of being stopped by a police officer while doing nothing wrong.\n\nThose of us who aren\u2019t black are sometimes too quick to dismiss these complaints. And given America\u2019s dark history of inequality before the law, it is understandable that African-Americans care passionately about having confidence in our system of laws, and the fairness by which they\u2019re enforced.\n\nShedrick Willis was a slave who, before the Civil War, had been bought and sold on the steps of the McLennan County Courthouse, the very place where 17-year-old Jesse Washington was dragged to his death.\n\nWhen I was governor of Texas, I had the honor of appointing Willis\u2019 great-great-great-grandson\u2014Wallace Jefferson\u2014to be the first African-American on the Supreme Court of Texas.\n\nIn 2004, I appointed Wallace to be the Supreme Court\u2019s first black Chief Justice.\n\nTexas has made a real difference for African-Americans\n\nIn Texas, we\u2019ve made a real difference in the lives of African-American families.\n\nWe haven\u2019t eliminated black poverty in Texas. But neither have we allowed it to fester.\n\nIn New York, the supplemental poverty rate for blacks is 26 percent. In California, it\u2019s 30 percent. In Washington, D.C., it\u2019s 33 percent.\n\nIn Texas, it\u2019s just 20 percent.\n\nIn 2014, Texas had its lowest crime rate since 1968. And the improvements keep coming. Last year, while crime rates rose in other states, we saw them decrease by 5 percent in Houston, 5 percent in San Antonio, 5 percent in Dallas, 8 percent in Fort Worth, and 10 percent in Austin.\n\nThe record is clear. So why is it that our movement fails to gain black support?\n\nAs I said earlier, we can blame political correctness. We can blame those who gin up resentment, who find grievance at every turn. But Republicans have much to do to earn the trust of African-Americans.\n\nThere is a legitimate federal role in civil rights\n\nBlacks know that Republican Barry Goldwater, in 1964, ran against Lyndon Johnson, a champion of civil rights.\n\nThey know that Barry Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, because he felt parts of it were unconstitutional.\n\nStates supporting segregation in the South cited \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d as a justification for keeping blacks from the voting booth and the dinner table.\n\nAs you know, I am an ardent believer in the Tenth Amendment, which was ratified in 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights.\n\nThe Tenth Amendment says that \u201cthe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\u201d\n\nI know that state governments are more accountable to you than the federal government is.\n\nBut I am also an ardent believer in the Fourteenth Amendment, which says that no state shall \u201cdeny to any jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d\n\nThere has been\u2014and will continue to be\u2014an important and legitimate role for the federal government in enforcing civil rights.\n\nToo often, we Republicans\u2014myself included\u2014have emphasized our message on the Tenth Amendment but not our message on the Fourteenth: an Amendment, it bears reminding, that was one of the first great contributions of the Republican Party to American life, second only to the abolition of slavery.\n\nFor too long, we Republicans have been content to lose the black vote, because we found that we could win elections without it.\n\nBut when we gave up on trying to win the support of African-Americans, we lost our moral legitimacy as the party of Lincoln, as the party of equal opportunity for all.\n\nIt is time for us to once again reclaim our heritage as the only party in our country founded on the principle of freedom for African-Americans.\n\nCriminal justice reform\n\nOne of the most important things we did in Texas while I was governor was reform our sentencing laws, so that non-violent offenders could stay out of prison.\n\nWe can do more. And we can do it while keeping our low-income communities safe from crime.\n\nLast year, we abolished the \u201cpick a pal\u201d system, which effectively allowed prosecutors to put their friends and neighbors on grand juries for the purpose of predetermining their outcome. I signed into law the Michael Morton Act, which allowed the defense to review the prosecution\u2019s evidence before trial.\n\nNew York and Colorado recently enacted laws that allow defense attorneys some access to the grand jury room, the production of witness transcripts, and advance notice for witnesses, so they have time to retain counsel.\n\nWe should strengthen the capacity of bar associations to discipline prosecutors who intentionally mislead grand juries and hide exculpatory evidence. And victims of prosecutorial abuse should be able to receive compensation for their suffering.\n\nAs Texans got smarter about policing and crime prevention, we came to appreciate the importance of keeping promising young people out of jail.\n\nWe are working to stop the inter-generational cycle of incarceration, where grandchildren meet their grandparents behind prison bars. In 2006, around 5,000 Texan kids were locked up. Today, it\u2019s closer to 1,000.\n\nIn 1990, a teenager named Tyrone Brown failed a marijuana test while he was on probation. For that single violation, he was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nIn 2007, I granted Tyrone a conditional pardon. But half of all prison admissions come from people whose parole or probation has been revoked.\n\nSo we shifted money away from building more prisons, toward specialized drug courts and programs that could help those in prison succeed on parole.\n\nThe best welfare program in America is a job\n\nPresident Obama and Secretary Clinton say that the best way to reduce crime is through more welfare. But here is what I have seen in my time in public service: the best welfare program in America is a job.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to get a job if you have a criminal conviction on your record. And that\u2019s why criminal justice reform is so important.\n\nBut there\u2019s an even bigger reason why Democratic policies have failed to cure poverty: It\u2019s because the only true cure for poverty is a job. And Democratic policies have made it too hard for the poor to find work.\n\nMany poor Americans want to leave welfare and rejoin the workforce.\n\nBut because of taxes and regulations, it often makes more economic sense to stay on welfare than to get a full-time job.\n\nFurthermore, federal programs impose a one-size-fits-all approach to fighting poverty.\n\nIn California, someone might need more money to deal with the cost of housing.\n\nIn Massachusetts, it might be the cost of vocational school.\n\nInstead, we force the poor to enroll in separate programs for housing assistance or Pell grants.\n\nCongress should pass a welfare reform bill that will take the money we already spend on non-health care-related, anti-poverty programs and split it into two parts.\n\nThe first part should be an expanded and reformed version of the Earned Income Tax Credit, so that anyone with a job can live above the poverty line.\n\nThe second part should consist of a block grant, so that states can care for their safety net populations in the manner that best serves their residents.\n\nThe exorbitant price of a college education\n\nWe all know we have to improve our schools.\n\nThis is an area where President Obama had potential. But he caved into the demands of labor unions.\n\nIt\u2019s a fallacy to assume that the vastly different student populations across the country can be adequately educated with one-size-fits-all policies.\n\nWe need to empower state lawmakers, school boards and parents to implement policies that address the specific needs of their students, and keep schools accountable and efficient.\n\nEnterprising charter school teachers\u2014like Eva Moskowitz in New York\u2014should be able to replicate their astounding success all over the country, without the interference of the federal government.\n\nAnd we have to tackle the exorbitant price of a college education.\n\nOne of the biggest barriers today to entering the middle class\u2014black or otherwise\u2014is the high cost of a college degree.\n\nA four-year degree at the typical private college now costs more than $170,000. Compare that to the median home price in America, of $205,000.\n\nWe are literally asking poor students to mortgage their future in order to gain a college degree.\n\nThis must end. In Texas, I challenged our state universities to offer a four-year college degree for less than $10,000.\n\nMany thought it would be impossible to drive tuition and fees that low. But today, 13 Texas universities have reached that target.\n\nWe are on the cusp of an online revolution in higher education. But only if the federal government rolls back the rules that make it almost impossible for students to gain accredited bachelor\u2019s degrees achieved with online instruction.\n\nTackle the high cost of living\n\nFurthermore, just as with college tuition, we have to reduce the cost of living for those who need every dollar to be stretched as far is it can go.\n\nRegulations like minimum wage hikes and Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate drive up the cost of hiring new workers.\n\nThat means that companies hire fewer people.\n\nBut it also means that the price of basic consumer goods goes up.\n\nEarlier this year, the Competitive Enterprise Institute estimated that federal regulations cost American businesses as much as $1.9 trillion a year.\n\nThat\u2019s nearly $15,000 per U.S. household. If you add in state regulations, the problem gets even worse.\n\nIf we, as state and local lawmakers, do these five things:\n\nkeep non-violent offenders out of prison\u2026\nlift barriers to urban jobs\u2026\nincentivize work\u2026\nreform our schools\u2026\nand reduce the cost of living\u2026\nWe will have done more for African-Americans than the last three Democratic Administrations combined.\n\nWe can leave America better than we found it\n\nAt the American Cemetery in Normandy, nine thousand three hundred and eighty-seven American soldiers are buried in orderly row upon orderly row.\n\n\u201cIf ever proof were needed that we fought for a cause and not for conquest,\u201d a general once said, \u201cit could be found in these cemeteries. Here was our only conquest: all we asked was enough soil in which to bury our gallant dead.\u201d\n\nSome of our gallant dead were the sons of Presidents, like Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.\n\nMost were ordinary Americans, simply doing what their country asked of them.\n\nSome of the graves don\u2019t even have names\u2014they\u2019re simply marked: \u201cHere rests in honored glory a comrade in arms known but to God.\u201d\n\nSome of the most compelling graves at Normandy are for African-Americans who served in segregated regiments, like Willie Collins of the 490th Port Battalion.\n\nWillie Collins made the ultimate sacrifice for America, despite the fact that America didn\u2019t always treat him in the way he deserved.\n\nBrigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. and Sergeant Willie Collins grew up in different circumstances.\n\nTed\u2019s ancestors had a coat of arms. Willie\u2019s ancestors were brought here in chains.\n\nBut Ted and Willie joined themselves together with a commitment that every generation of Americans has embraced: the promise of leaving America and the world a better place than they found it\u2026of ensuring a better future for the children and grandchildren of those to come.\n\nI am a beneficiary of the sacrifices of Sergeant Collins and General Roosevelt, and of so many others known but to God.\n\nI grew up in a place called Paint Creek.\n\nWhen I was young, we had an outhouse and mom bathed us on the back porch in a number two washtub.\n\nWe attended the Paint Creek Rural School, where some of the teachers lived on campus.\n\nTheir profession was literally their life, and they inspired me. I can assure you none of my teachers knew they were instructing a future Air Force pilot, let alone a future governor.\n\nBut they also have a motto at the Paint Creek School that summarizes the endless possibilities for its students: \u201cNo dream too tall for a school so small.\u201d\n\nMany people don\u2019t feel that their lives are filled with endless possibilities anymore.\n\nAmericans entering adulthood today have good reason to fear that it will be harder for them to earn a living\u2014to buy a home\u2014to pay off their debts\u2014than it was for their parents.\n\nBut if there is one thing we can learn from Willie Collins and the millions like him\u2014from the tragedy of Jesse Washington and the triumph of Wallace Jefferson\u2014it\u2019s that America has overcome far greater obstacles than the ones we face today.\n\nWillie Collins died in the belief that America could become a better country than the one he left home to serve. And he was right.\n\nIt\u2019s up to us to be worthy of the country that Willie Collins\u2019 generation gave us.\n\nIt\u2019s up to us to leave our country better off than we found it.\n\nAmerica has never been perfect\u2014no country composed of imperfect beings ever could be.\n\nBut there is no country that has achieved more than the United States of America.\n\nWith new leadership and durable reforms, America can be freer and stronger than it has ever been.\n\nAmerica can be that exceptional place, where nothing in life is guaranteed, but where we have restored the faith of all Americans of all colors and creeds in the power of liberty and the equality of justice.\n\nWhere we all have the opportunity to build a better life for ourselves and our children and their children.\n\nThank you\u2014and may God bless America.\n\n=== ronald_reagan_1986_challenger_address.txt ===\n**Ronald Reagan - Address to the Nation on the Challenger Disaster**\n\n**Bibliographic Information:**\n- **Speaker:** Ronald Reagan, 40th President of the United States\n- **Event:** Address to the Nation on the Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster\n- **Speech Type:** National Tragedy Address\n- **Date:** January 28, 1986\n- **Location:** Oval Office, The White House\n- **Context:** Address delivered on the evening of the Challenger disaster, replacing the planned State of the Union address\n- **Source:** C-SPAN (YouTube Archive)\n- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66mGwws7EEw\n- **Duration:** 4 minutes 22 seconds\n- **Views:** Over 222,000\n- **Classification:** Conservative Dignity (Validation Set)\n- **Historical Significance:** One of the most moving presidential addresses in American history, providing comfort to a grieving nation and demonstrating presidential leadership during national tragedy. Features the iconic closing line from John Gillespie Magee Jr.'s poem \"High Flight.\"\n\n---\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the State of the Union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans.\n\nToday is a day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle Challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss.\n\nNineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground. But we've never lost an astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle. But they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly.\n\nWe mourn seven heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn their loss as a nation together.\n\nFor the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, \"Give me a challenge, and I'll meet it with joy.\" They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve, and they did. They served all of us.\n\nWe've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for twenty-five years, the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.\n\nAnd I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them.\n\nI've always had great faith in and respect for our space program, and what happened today does nothing to diminish it. We don't hide our space program. We don't keep secrets and cover things up. We do it all up front and in public. That's the way freedom is, and we wouldn't change it for a minute.\n\nWe'll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue.\n\nI want to add that I wish I could talk to every man and woman who works for NASA or who worked on this mission and tell them: \"Your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades. And we know of your anguish. We share it.\"\n\nThere's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama. In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and an historian later said, \"He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it.\" Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication was, like Drake's, complete.\n\nThe crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and \"slipped the surly bonds of earth\" to \"touch the face of God.\"\n\nThank you.\n\n=== tillis_coons_2017_criminal_justice_reform.txt ===\nTITLE: America's Criminal Justice System Is Broken\nSPEAKERS: Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Chris Coons (D-DE)\nROLES: U.S. Senators, Members of Senate Judiciary Committee\nDATE: January 9, 2017\nVENUE: CNN Op-Ed\nSOURCE: CNN.com / BladenOnline.com\nURL: https://bladenonline.com/tilliscoons-op-ed-americas-criminal-justice-system-is-broken/\nCLASSIFICATION: Conservative Dignity (Bipartisan)\nFRAMEWORK_QUADRANT: Conservative/Dignity\nVALIDATION_STUDY: Civic Virtue Framework - Dignity vs Tribalism Dimension\nEXTRACTED: December 2024\n\n===== OP-ED CONTENT =====\n\nAs a Democrat from Delaware and a Republican from North Carolina, we disagree on plenty of policy issues. You might think that would be especially true of an issue as historically divisive and politically challenging as crime and punishment.\n\nThat's not the case. We share a strong belief that America's criminal justice system is broken, focusing far too much on criminalization and incarceration and far too little on rehabilitation.\n\nA compelling example of the urgent need for reform is how our system treats juvenile offenders. We know that young people's relationship with the criminal justice apparatus has powerful, lasting consequences for them, their families, and their communities. It is therefore vitally important we make sure that all children who come into contact with the criminal justice system are treated fairly and appropriately, are not forgotten, and are afforded an opportunity to rehabilitate and become productive, contributing members of society.\n\nOur agreement on this issue was on display late last year at a juvenile justice summit, where we shared the stage for a discussion on a key challenge facing our country: a criminal justice system that over-emphasizes incarceration and is woefully inadequate when it comes to rehabilitation, even for our nation's youth.\n\nMen and women in law enforcement work hard to protect our communities across the country. As legislators, we must be committed to developing a criminal justice system that effectively promotes public safety, fairness, and rehabilitation. We believe Congress has both a moral and a fiscal imperative to ensure that our criminal justice system appropriately calibrates sentences to offenses. That is being smart on crime, not soft on crime.\n\nDespite political disagreements in Congress on a broader criminal justice reform package \u2014 disagreements we hope to move past next year \u2014 Democrats and Republicans surely can agree that children shouldn't be locked in a solitary confinement cell for 23 hours a day, or housed with other prisoners twice their age and size, or unnecessarily restrained and shackled for minor infractions, or harshly punished for low-level, nonviolent offenses.\n\nSurely we can agree that juveniles' interactions with the judicial system shouldn't be just about punishment, but instead must also focus on understanding the impacts of what they have done and why it was wrong. A system that focuses on rehabilitation, not punishment, doesn't excuse bad behavior. Rather, it helps all parties heal and move forward, and it keeps all of us safer by breaking cycles of recidivism.\n\nWe both recognize that this system is in desperate need of reform. We share a frustration that some politicians in both parties have been too willing to put politics before policy. We also share a belief that our home states offer a road map forward.\n\nIn North Carolina, several reforms have been made in recent years, including allowing a juvenile's criminal record to be expunged of non-violent offenses, limiting detention for certain offenses, and requiring a parent, guardian, or attorney to be present during police interrogations of any child under the age of 16.\n\nIn Delaware, this year alone, the state legislature passed laws to expand the use of civil citations instead of criminal charges, to end shackling of youth except where it's necessary for safety, to provide free legal representation to all children charged with a crime, and to make it easier for juveniles to expunge their records.\n\nWe've seen some progress at the national level. President Barack Obama rightly acted to end solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons. The Supreme Court ruled that it is cruel and unusual to sentence juveniles to the death penalty or to a mandatory sentence of death in prison.\n\nHere in Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which we both serve, passed the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act on a bipartisan 15-5 vote. Among its many provisions, the bill would limit solitary confinement for juveniles in federal custody. More broadly, it would begin to address the imbalance between incarceration and rehabilitation to reconstitute families, save taxpayer dollars, and restore fairness to our criminal justice system. It achieves this without harming the integrity of public safety as prison sentences would only be recalibrated for certain nonviolent offenders and would require careful judicial oversight.\n\nIn Leviticus 19, the Lord urges Moses, \"Do not pervert justice; do not show partiality to the poor or favoritism to the great, but judge your neighbor fairly.\" We do a great disservice to our nation's future when we do not judge children fairly or treat them justly.\n\nFor the many Americans disillusioned by Washington, consider that support for smart and sensible reforms to our juvenile justice and criminal justice systems is slowly but surely gaining traction across party lines. In the year ahead, we will both remain committed to casting partisan politics aside in order to get these commonsense proposals passed through Congress and signed into law.",

I don't want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and leadership, and especially recognize the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin, who has been a hero of mine on issues of criminal justice reform, as well as Mike Lee, who's been a champion. All of their staffs, everyone who's been involved in the tireless work and efforts that have been going on in what is a bill that is pending on the floor now - the First Step Act.\n\nI also want to recognize the incredible people, many of them advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists, so many of the groups that have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have criminal justice reform in this country. A lot of these groups have been organized and working for years and years, years before I became to the Senate, to try to bring forth criminal justice reform. They've offered insight, they've brought wisdom, they've helped to shape this legislation. Their advocacy has made this a better bill. It's because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill, to begin to deliver some reform to our savagely broken criminal justice system.\n\nI'm proud of this coalition. I'm proud that the coalition has people all across the political spectrum. I'm proud of the coalition as people from diverse backgrounds. This is how change has been made in this country for generations. But I want to return to this fact: that we are poised to do this bill because of the deeply savage, broken criminal justice system that we have.\n\nSince 1980 alone, our federal prison population has exploded by eight hundred percent - an 800 percent increase in our prison population. And this is because of failed policies by this body that created harsh sentences, harsh mandatory minimum penalties, three-strikes-you're-out, the kind of bills that have helped this population of prisoners to grow to be the largest in terms of percentage on the planet Earth. America is now the preeminent incarceration nation. We are the incarceration capital of the planet Earth.\n\nAnd even though we only have 5% of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated people on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. One in three of all the incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United States of America. And today, close to a third of all the adults in the United States has a criminal record. We have criminalized the United States population - about a third of Americans have a criminal record.\n\nBut after decades of failed federal policies, and after decades of growing in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in a significant way. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to who we say we are as a nation. We profess - we actually swear an oath to the flag - that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all. But our criminal justice system violates those values.\n\nI believe you can tell a lot about a nation not by its buildings, not by its measures or its wealth, but you can tell a lot about the true character of the nation by looking at its prisons and seeing who they incarcerate. You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes and see how they imprison their political opposition. You can go to some countries and see that they actually incarcerate members of the media. We don't do that in the United States, but we in this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, you see overwhelmingly we incarcerate those who are marginalized in our society, those who are most vulnerable in our society.\n\nOverwhelmingly, in the United States of America, our prisons and jails are full of those Americans who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a system that hurts them. Our prisons and jails have become warehouses for people that are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease, struggling with illness. Right now our prisons and jails are filled overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who are survivors of sexual assault, and also overwhelmingly it's full of Americans who are low-income, full of poor folks and people who are disproportionally people of color.\n\nThis is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities and not others. The war on drugs, which has fueled so much of the explosion of our prison population, has really been a war on people - on certain people in certain communities and not on others.\n\nI'm the only United States Senator that lives in a majority black and brown community. It is low income, but I tell you right now, my community does not mistake wealth with worth. I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end of most weeks, I draw strength from my community. I see the evidence of the incredible growth that's occurred when good people in a city pull together, work together, and can accomplish things that other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, or just plain dissing them don't think as possible. I'm proud of my community.\n\nBut despite all the work that's been done in the City of Newark, I still live in a community that is both over-criminalized and under-protected because of federal policies, because of policies in this body, policies that mistake the severity of a punishment with the actual security of a people.\n\nWe know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crimes among people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way that our drug laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target people of color and low-income communities. We have a system that - over a century, we in a nation have overcome slavery, decades of Jim Crow - but as one author, Michelle Alexander, calls our criminal justice system, she calls it the new Jim Crow because of its disproportionate impact on people of color.\n\nWe now have a criminal justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal supervision than there were enslaved in 1850. This is a punishing reality. I've seen with my own eyes where people in certain privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of arrests that you do in other communities in our country.\n\nAnd the truth about human nature, about human beings, is that all of us make mistakes. That's an inevitable part of life. But the way our country's drug laws are designed and applied, a kid in a more privileged community or on a college campus gets a chance to stumble, to learn a lesson, wide margin for error. But a kid living in a community that's low-income or communities that's black and brown, they get trapped by a system that disproportionately impacts their lives than it does others.\n\nAs Bryan Stevenson has said, we live in a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent. We see in the United States of America Americans getting trapped in a system that - we know the data is clear - there is no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or selling drugs in the United States of America. No difference. But if you are black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for possession of drugs.\n\nThis is one of the things that have led to such a dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the United States of America. People right now in our country sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the last three presidents admitted to doing, but encountered a different type of justice system. The scales of justice in America are not balanced.\n\nThis is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people that are often already struggling, often already hurt. What do we do in this country with a nonviolent drug offense? What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life. Even after you've come out of a prison sentence, or even if you got no time served at all, once you are convicted for nonviolent drug offense - again, like people in this body and in the White House have done before - if you've been convicted for that crime, potentially in this body, I'm making no accusations, but once you've been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you're one of those folks that's been convicted of a non-violent drug offense, you have to check a box that says you're gonna have a difficulty being hired, that you're gonna have difficulty getting housing, you can't get many business licenses, you can't get food stamps, you can't get a loan from the bank.\n\nIn fact, the American Bar Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a criminal conviction in this country - 40,000 collateral consequences that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.\n\nAnd so now we're debating a funding bill, it's dominating the news, but we already are drawing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the black hole of mass incarceration, not making us safer, not making us stronger, in fact making us more vulnerable as a community. We have been using government resources not to offer more support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans, putting them into a system that actually harms them often more than helps them with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their trauma.\n\nWe are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that people have already endured, to incarcerate more Americans than ever before in our history, and ultimately makes our neighborhoods and communities - ones like mine - less safe, not more. And despite the fact that our infrastructure in this country is crumbling, that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need of repair, we have been investing in a different type of infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has been opened every 10 days. Billions and billions of dollars for the constructions of prisons and jails to warehouse human potential - folks who often need help and counseling and mental health care, need to be rehabilitated.\n\nWe've been taking the far more expensive way and warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping them. And we call this system a justice system. It is not meant to be a system of retribution. It's meant to be a justice system. It's not meant to be a system of punishment - it's not meant to be punishment only. It's supposed to be meant to be a justice system.\n\nWe are Americans. We have ideals of restoration, of rehabilitation. Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe that this is a nation where redemption is possible. One of our Senate colleagues, a former colleague who stood in this very well, he got into a lot of trouble in his youth, was convicted of multiple crimes - crimes like arson, crimes like assault. He attacked a police officer. He actually became one of the most serious, outspoken advocates for restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson.\n\nAnd this is what he once wrote. He said, \"I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my .22 caliber rifle never struck anybody. I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up call and I listened.\" He went on to say that \"I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community. When a young person is sent up the river, we need to remember that all rivers can change course.\"\n\nHe went from an arsonist, he went from a person that attacked police officers, he went from a person that was admittedly guilty of crimes to a United States Senator, because we are a nation that believes in redemption.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that when most people go to prison, ninety-five percent of those folks right now in state prisons will come back to our communities. And the question is, will they come out further harmed by the system, or better able to start again, better able to avoid more criminality, or will they be people that actually helped to make us safer and stronger, to be elevated towards that ideal of full citizenship?\n\nThose of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith, we know the story of the prodigal child - that child that did wrong, but yet when they came back, their father embraced them. It was that story held in the Christian community as an ideal. But what do we do in America is not the story of the prodigal child, because this is a system that right now inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate them.\n\nThis is a system that still subjects young people to what other countries and human rights activists in this nation call torture - juvenile solitary confinement. This is a system that in some places still denies women access to basic sanitary products. This is a system that in some places still allows the shackling of pregnant women during birth. This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically, fracturing entire communities like the one I live in.\n\nIt is a system that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income neighborhoods. In fact, according to a study from Villanova University, the poverty rate in all of America would be 20% lower if we had incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers. This system as a whole is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it's hurting every single American.\n\nBut today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the ills of this system. And that's why I'm proud that this is a bipartisan compromise bill with leadership - extraordinary leadership on both sides of the aisle - saying, hey, there are things we need to begin to correct in this system. There's ways to make this system more fair. There's ways to make the system better reflect our collective values and ideals.\n\nBecause of this collective work done over the last years, this bill includes critical sentencing reform that will reduce mandatory minimums and give judges discretion back - not legislators, but judges who sit and see all the totality of the facts. Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the racially-based crack cocaine sentencing disparity has already been negotiated down from a hundred to one to 18 to one. It should be equal. It should be one to one, but we've made progress.\n\nThe problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied, and because of that, there are people sitting in jail right now for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a suitcase. We never made this change retroactive. That's not justice.\n\nMaking this fix in this bill alone will mean that thousands of Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for release, and it addresses some of the racial disparities in our system because 90% of the people that will benefit from that are African-American; 96% are black and Latina.\n\nThis bill includes a provision that I've worked on for the past four years that will effectively end the use of juvenile solitary confinement among young people under federal supervision. This bill takes an important step, but still incomplete step, in reforming the way women are treated behind bars. This bill will ensure incarcerated women have access to free sanitary products and ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women. Last year I introduced a bill that includes this reform among others, and I'm happy to see it part now of this legislation.\n\nCan we do more? Yes. This legislation is a product of compromise. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, but if we pass this legislation, it is a step in the right direction, and I hope momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that are supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.\n\nLet's make no mistake, this legislation, which is one small step, will affect thousands and thousands of lives. Those are not just some people. When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of justice, you affect the lives of all Americans, because we as a people cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault without assaulting our own.\n\nDr. King said justice is indivisible, and he was right. We cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it won't affect us all as a whole. It couldn't be further from the truth. You cannot deny justice to any American without it affecting us all. You cannot keep injustice for some without it cheapening the justice of us all.\n\nAs a man much greater than any in this body once said, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We were all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a common garment.\" We cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal justice system that is so punishing some is not hurting this country as a whole. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a gaping self-inflicted wound. This bill is a step - a step towards healing.\n\nMr. President, it's been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life, easily one of the greatest honors as a senator, to work in a bipartisan coalition over the last five years to get to this point. I've had the opportunity to sit down with people in common cause from Republicans on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals in organizations who on most issues I often disagree with, but we have found common ground because this system is an affront to our most fundamental common values on both sides of this aisle - values of freedom, values of liberty, values of equality, values of fairness and justice.\n\nWe share those common values because we still live in a nation where the ties that bind us are stronger than the lines that divide us. This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as a people by the most precious ideals in humanity - the ideals that were put forth by our founders and that have been aspired to in every generation and have been worked on in every generation, making us a more perfect union.\n\nWe know that our nation's history - bills and debates we've seen in this very body - we know our nation's history is scarred by many wretched injustices: slavery and the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation. But like people, individuals who've done wrong in the past, like people, our nation has demonstrated the capacity to change. We as a nation have demonstrated the capacity to improve. Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation the capacity to redeem ourselves.\n\nNone of us should ever be judged by the least of what we've done, but instead by our ability and our capacity to find redemption. Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real, making the dream more accessible to us all. And standing for each other, we have worked with each other, we have sacrificed with each other, despite differences in race and differences in color, difference in religion and creed.\n\nEvery single great gain in this country has been made by multi-ethnic, multiracial, broad-based coalitions because we recognize the ideal that is above the President's desk, written in stone here - that ideal of e pluribus unum: out of the many, one. We know that that's not just a slogan. Those aren't just words. It is a calling to the people of this country.\n\nI want to see more than the bill we have today, and I know we can do more than just this bill we have today. But this is a first step. It is a necessary step for the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will be directly affected. This is a step in the right direction. I hope that we all come together and make this first step momentum on the journey we have.\n\nWork to do in this country. I'm proud to have been a part of what can be a historic step in the right direction. May our work continue.\n\nMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n=== elizabeth_warren_nyc.txt ===\nElizabeth Warren Speaks in New York City\n\nhttps://2020.elizabethwarren.com/nyc-speech\n\nSeptember 16, 2019\n\n\n\nNew York City, NY - Elizabeth Warren delivered a speech today at Washington Square Park, near the site of the former Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. Elizabeth spoke about how corruption in Washington has allowed the rich and powerful to tilt the rules and grow richer and more powerful.\n\nBelow are her remarks as prepared for delivery: \n\nThanks, acknowledgements\n\n\n\nHello, New York!\n\nWhen so many good people show up, I usually do a town hall followed by selfies. But tonight is something different. I want to tell a story that I haven\u2019t had a chance to tell before\u2014an important story about our past and our future. But I\u2019ll still stay afterwards for as long as anyone wants to take selfies. Some things we just don\u2019t mess with!  \n\nI\u2019m especially glad to be here in Washington Square Park. I wanted to give this speech here\u2014but not because of the arch behind me or the president this square is named for. \n\nNo: we\u2019re not here today because of famous arches or famous men. In fact, we\u2019re not here because of men at all.\n\nWe\u2019re here because of some hard-working women. Women who, more than a hundred years ago, worked long hours in a brown, ten-story building a block that way. Women who worked at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory.\n\nIt was March 25th, 1911, a Saturday.\n\nAt about 4:45 in the afternoon, people walking through this park looked up and saw black smoke billowing into the sky. A fire had started in a building over there. Inside that building, on the top three floors, deadly flames leapt from a bin, to the oily floors, and from the floors to the walls, sweeping across the workrooms and trapping the workers.  \n\nFighting for their lives, women\u2014girls really, some as young as 14\u2014raced to escape. But the exit doors were locked. Others ran to the windows \u2013 waving their arms and screaming for help. \n\nBut no help was coming. \n\nThe fire department\u2019s ladders could only reach to the 6th floor.  \n\nThe flames leapt higher, and women climbed out onto the ledges.  \n\nAnd as people on the ground stood in shocked silence, a woman jumped. Then another, then another. They hit the ground with a sickening thud. They died on impact.  So many, so fast that the women\u2019s bodies piled up on the sidewalk. Their blood ran into the gutters.   \n\nDozens more were trapped inside. Trapped because the door to the staircase was locked\u2014locked by bosses afraid the workers might steal scraps of cloth. Firefighters would later find a pile of burned bodies next to that very door. \n\nIt took 18 minutes for 146 people to die. Mostly women. Mostly immigrants\u2014Jewish and Italian. Mostly people who made as little as $5 a week to get their shot at the American dream. \n\nIt was one of the worst industrial disasters in American history. One of the worst, but it should not have been a surprise. \n\nFor years, across the city, women factory workers and their allies had been sounding the alarm about dangerous and squalid conditions\u2014fighting for shorter hours and higher pay. They protested. They went on strike. They got coverage in the press. Everyone knew about these problems. \n\nBut the fat profits were making New York\u2019s factory owners rich, and they had no plans to give that up. Instead of changing conditions at the factories, the owners worked their political connections.\n\nThey made campaign contributions and talked with their friends in the legislature. They greased the state government so thoroughly that nothing changed. Business owners got richer, politicians got more powerful, and working people paid the price.\n\nDoes any of that sound familiar?\n\nTake any big problem we have in America today and you don\u2019t have to dig very deep to see the same system at work.\n\nClimate change. Gun safety. Health care. On the face of it, these three are totally different issues. But despite our being the strongest and wealthiest country in the history of the world, our democracy is paralyzed.  \n\nWhy? Because giant corporations have bought off our government.\n\nAmericans are killed by floods and fires in a rapidly warming planet. Why? Because huge fossil fuel corporations have bought off our government.\n\nAmericans are killed with unthinkable speed and efficiency in our streets and stores and schools. Why? Because the gun industry has bought off our government.\n\nAmericans are dying because they can\u2019t afford to fill prescriptions or pay for treatment. Why? Because health insurance companies and drug companies have bought off our government.\n\nAmericans disagree on many things, but we don\u2019t want each other\u2019s homes burned down by wildfires. We don\u2019t want each other\u2019s children murdered at school. We don\u2019t want each other\u2019s families bankrupted by medical bills. \n\nWhat we want is for our government to do something!\n\nAnd yet, our federal government is unable to act, unable to take even the most basic steps to protect the American people. \n\nWhen you see a government that works great for those with money and connections and doesn\u2019t work much for anyone else, that\u2019s corruption\u2014plain and simple. And it\u2019s time to call it out for what it is. \n\nCorruption has put our planet at risk. Corruption has broken our economy. And corruption is breaking our democracy.\n\nI know what\u2019s broken, I\u2019ve got a plan to fix it, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for President of the United States.\n\n--\n\nOK, let\u2019s start with the obvious. Donald Trump is corruption in the flesh. He is sworn to serve the people of the United States, but he serves only himself and his partners in corruption.  \n\nHe tries to divide us\u2014white against Black, Christians against Muslims, straight against queer and trans, everyone against immigrants. Because if we\u2019re all fighting each other, no one will notice that he and his buddies are stealing more and more of our country\u2019s wealth and destroying the future for everyone else. \n\nAs bad as things are, we have to recognize that our problems didn\u2019t start with Donald Trump. He made them worse, but we need to take a deep breath and recognize that a country that elects Donald Trump is already in serious trouble.  \n\nRepublican politicians sold out a long time ago. Filling the courts with judges who expand the rights of corporations while they destroy the rights of citizens. Passing tax cuts for wealthy donors, while doing nothing to help working families. Sucking up corporate donations while lying about climate change, lying about guns, and lying about health care.\n\nAnd too many politicians in both parties have convinced themselves that playing the money-for-influence game is the only way to get things done.\n\nWhat has all this corrupt business-as-usual gotten us? The extinction of one species after another as the earth heats up.  Children slaughtered by assault weapons. The highest levels of inequality in a century. Wages that barely budge. Crippling student loan debt. Shrinking opportunity for the next generation and the one after that. The American people get it\u2014and they are sick of it.  \n\nCorruption has taken over our government\u2014and we\u2019re running out of time. We must root it out and to return our democracy to the people. And\u2014I\u2019ve got a plan for that!\n\nYes, I've got a lot of plans, but they all come back to one simple idea: put economic and political power in the hands of the people.\n\nWe start by rooting out corruption in government. No more business-as-usual\u2014let\u2019s attack the corruption head on!  \n\nI have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate\u2014a plan to shut down the ability of the rich and powerful to use their money to tilt every decision in Washington.  And here\u2019s a sample of what we can do:\n\nEnd lobbying as we know it.\n\nNo high-ranking public official should be thinking about their next job while they are collecting a paycheck to represent the American people\u2014so I have a lifetime ban on Senators, Congressmen and Cabinet Secretaries from ever becoming lobbyists \n\nNo more hiring corporate lobbyists to staff up the federal government.  \n\nThe right of every person in this country to petition their government does not protect a multi-billion dollar influence industry whose sole purpose is to undermine democracy and tilt every decision in favor of those who can pay. So let's shut down this industry and return our government to the people. \n\nAnd there\u2019s more:\n\nNo more secret meetings\u2014every single meeting between a lobbyist and a public official should be a matter of public record. \n\nNo more lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. \n\nAnd no more campaign contributions or bundling by lobbyists. Contributing to a campaign at the same time you are paid to influence those same government officials is the very definition of bribery, and we\u2019re going to put a stop to it.\n\nAnyone\u2014anyone\u2014who wants to run for public office will have to put their tax returns online. \n\nThere\u2019s more: \n\nPresidents, cabinet members, members of Congress will be barred from owning businesses on the side. Barred from owning and trading in individual stocks. Take care of the people\u2019s business or your own business, but you can\u2019t do both at the same time. \n\nCorruption and influence-peddling has seeped into every corner of our government, so it\u2019s time for some new plans for regulators. \n\nFar too many agencies act like wholly owned subsidiaries of the companies they're supposed to regulate. When these agencies are captured, the results are pollution and financial advisers who cheat people\u2014all while regulators look the other way.\n\nEnough is enough. We will take down the \"for sale\" signs hanging outside of every federal building in Washington.  \n\nIt\u2019s also time to call out corruption in the federal judiciary.      \n\nIncreasingly, big shot corporate lawyers are getting appointed as federal judges, and they turn out one decision after another in favor of corporations and against the interests of American consumers, against unions, and against vulnerable people who must count on the courts to protect their rights. Shadowy right-wing groups have spent millions of dollars to ram through aggressively unqualified nominees who are likely to help advance their causes.  \n\nNobody should be surprised that public confidence in our federal courts is at an all-time low. But we can fix it.  \n\nWe will rewrite the basic code of ethics for federal judges. \n\nWe will appoint a new generation of judges with diverse backgrounds and a wide range of legal experiences\u2014judges who actually believe in fundamental principles like rule of law, civil rights, and equal justice.\n\nAnd finally, we will end the corruption of our campaign finance system. \n\nOverturn Citizens United\u2014democracy is not for sale.\n\nGet rid of SuperPACs and secret spending by billionaires.\n\nAnd break the big donor stranglehold by creating a system of public funding of our elections. \n\nI know that some people will always have more money, so they can own more shoes or more clothes than other people. But no one should own more of our democracy!  \n\nCorruption comes in other forms too\u2014and I have plans for those.\n\nA plan to end the corrupt practice of selling fancy ambassadorships to wealthy donors, because American diplomacy should not be for sale.\n\nA plan to abolish private prisons. No one should make a profit locking people up\u2014and no one should have a financial incentive to lobby Congress to lock up even more people. \n\nA plan to stop selling access to federal lands and national parks to giant polluters, and to break the stranglehold of the coal industry and oil industry in energy production and transportation.\n\nAnd yes, when we\u2019re talking corruption, we need to call it out in the Oval Office. I read the Mueller Report, all 448 pages. No one is above the law, not even the president of the United States\u2014impeachment is our Constitutional duty. \n\nSo there it is: Step one: tackle corruption head on. \n\nThe next task: transform our economy so that every person\u2014no matter where they live, or who their parents are, or how much money they have\u2014every person has real opportunity: the chance to work hard, play by the same set of rules, and take care of themselves and the people they love.\n\nCorruption in Washington has allowed the rich and powerful to tilt the rules and grow richer and more powerful. But this small slice at the top hasn\u2019t just scooped up a huge chunk of the wealth all of us have worked hard to produce\u2014they\u2019ve also gobbled up opportunity itself. For the rich and powerful, there are first, second, third, and fourth chances to get ahead. But for a lot of Americans, and especially for people of color, there\u2019s barely one\u2014or, for some, no chance at all.\n\nWe have the power to fix that. We\u2019re the wealthiest nation in the history of the world\u2014we can afford Medicare for All to save our people and a Green New Deal to save our planet. \n\nWe just need real investments in working people. \n\nWe start with more power in the hands of workers. Make it easy to join a union, and give unions more power when they negotiate.  \n\nAnd yes, it\u2019s time for a wealth tax. That\u2019s a two-cent tax on fortunes over $50 million. Your first $50 million\u2014don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re in the clear. But for the 50 millionth and first dollar, pitch in two cents\u2014and two cents for every dollar after that.  Just two cents.\n\nBecause I look at it this way: You built a great fortune\u2014well, or you inherited one?  Good for you. But I guarantee that any great fortune in America was built, at least in part, using workers all of us helped pay to educate. Built at least in part getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay to build. Built at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay their salaries.  \n\nAnd we\u2019re happy to do it. This is America\u2014we\u2019re happy to invest in opportunities for everyone.  But we\u2019re saying that if you make it really, really, really big, bigger than 50 million dollars, then pitch in two cents so everyone else can have a chance.\n\nAnd what can we do with two cents?\n\nUniversal childcare for every baby in this country, age zero to five.\n\nUniversal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in this country.\n\nRaise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America.\n\nMake technical school, community college and four-year college tuition-free for everyone who wants to get an education.\n\nLevel the playing field and put $50 billion into Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other minority serving institutions.\n\nAnd cancel student loan debt for 95% of people who have it. \n\nWhat does all that mean? Real opportunity\u2014not just for people born into privilege. Opportunity for everyone.\n\nOpportunity\u2014real opportunity\u2014requires honesty. Working families all across this country have been denied the opportunities they deserve, but the path for Black and Brown and Native families has been even steeper. That\u2019s why my plans tackle historical injustice head on and here are a few examples:\n\nMy student debt cancellation plan will help close the wealth gap between Black and white families.\n\nMy criminal justice plans will end the practice of mass incarceration that has destroyed the lives of so many Black and Brown men.\n\nMy housing plan will help families living in formerly redlined areas buy a home and start building the kind of wealth that government-sponsored discrimination denied their parents and grandparents. \n\nMy climate plan includes justice for the Black and Brown communities that have struggled with the impact of pollution, and my plan respects the rights of Native Americans to protect their lands and be good stewards of this earth.\n\nAnd on day one of my administration, I will use my executive authority to start closing the pay gap between women of color and everyone else\u2014because it\u2019s about time we fully valued the work of women of color.\n\nWe must recognize the systemic discrimination that infects our economy, and we must work actively\u2014and deliberately\u2014to root it out and set us on a better path. \n\nThe time for holding back is over. We need big, structural change! \n\nNow I know what some people are thinking. Whoa, too much. Too big. Too hard. But I know this change is possible\u2014I know it, because America has made big, structural change before.\n\nLet me take you back to that day of the fire .\n\nA woman was visiting friends who lived in a townhouse behind me when the fire broke out. \n\nShe hurried into the street, joining the crowds as they ran across this park and headed to the Triangle Factory. When she got there, she watched.  Watched as women on the ledge begged for help. Watched as they held each other. Watched as they jumped to their deaths.\n\nThe woman watching was Frances Perkins. She was thirty years old and already a workers\u2019 rights activist, but that day set change in motion.  \n\nA week later, the women\u2019s trade unions organized a funeral march, and half a million people showed up to march down Fifth Avenue, right behind me. Half a million people in 1911.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t their first march, but this time was different. While the women of the trade unions kept pushing from the outside, Frances pushed from the inside. She understood that those women died because of the greed of their bosses and the corruption of their elected officials. \n\nSo she went up to Albany, ready to fight. She worked to create a commission investigating factory conditions, and then she served as its lead investigator. Remember, this was years before women could even vote, let alone play major roles in government. \n\nBut Frances had a plan. She and her fellow activists fought for fire safety, of course\u2014and they got it. Next time you do a fire drill at school or work or you see a plainly-marked fire exit at work, think of Frances and the Triangle women, because they\u2019re the reason the laws changed. \n\nBut they didn\u2019t stop with fire safety. With Frances working the system from the inside, the women workers organizing and applying pressure from the outside, they rewrote New York State\u2019s labor laws from top to bottom to protect workers.\n\nOver time, Frances Perkins became the state\u2019s leading expert on working conditions. Later, when Franklin Roosevelt was elected governor, he appointed her to head his Labor department in Albany. And, four years after that, in the depths of the Great Depression, when Roosevelt became President, he asked Frances to come to Washington to address the crisis as Secretary of Labor for the entire nation.\n\nFrances Perkins became the first woman in history to serve in the Cabinet. And what did she push for when she got there? Big, structural change.  \n\nShe used the same model she and her friends had used after the Triangle Fire: she worked the political system relentlessly from the inside, while a sustained movement applied pressure from the outside. As Frances Perkins put it: the Triangle Fire was \u201cthe day the New Deal was born.\u201d\n\nSo, what did one woman\u2014one very persistent woman\u2014backed up by millions of people across this country get done?  Social Security. Unemployment insurance. Abolition of child labor. Minimum wage. The right to join a union. Even the very existence of the weekend.  Big, structural change. One woman, and millions of people to back her up. \n\nThe tragic story of the Triangle factory fire is a story about power.\n\nA story of what happens when the rich and the powerful take control of government and use it to increase their own profits while they stick it to working people. \n\nBut what happened in the aftermath of the fire is a different story about power\u2014our power, about what\u2019s possible when we all fight together as one. \n\nOver and over, throughout our history, Americans have been told that it wasn\u2019t possible to make big, structural change\u2014and that they should just give up.\n\nThe abolitionists were told it\u2019s just too hard, give up now.\n\nSuffragettes were told it\u2019s just too hard, give up now.\n\nEarly union organizers were told it\u2019s just too hard, give up now.\n\nFoot soldiers in the civil rights movement were told it\u2019s just too hard, give up now.\n\nLGBTQ activists were told it\u2019s just too hard, give up now.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t give up. They organized. They built a grassroots movement. They persisted. And they changed the course of American history.\n\n2020 is about the direction America goes, not just for four years, but for generations to come.  Yes, there\u2019s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared. But we can't choose a candidate we don't believe in just because we're too scared to do anything else.  And Democrats can\u2019t win if we\u2019re scared and looking backward.\n\nWe win when we meet the moment. We win when we stand up for what is right. And we win when we get out there and fight for it. \n\nI am not afraid. And you can't be afraid, either.\n\nSo if you\u2019re ready to fight. Join me. \n\nGo to ElizabethWarren.com. Help us organize. Volunteer. Donate five bucks. Text \u201cFIGHT\u201d to 24477. We need everyone\u2014all-in.\n\nBecause here\u2019s the truth.\n\nThis is our moment in history. Our moment to dream big, fight hard\u2014and win.\n\n=== john_lewis_1963_march_washington.txt ===\n**John Lewis - Speech at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom**\n\n**Bibliographic Information:**\n- **Speaker:** John Lewis, Chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)\n- **Event:** March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom\n- **Speech Type:** Civil Rights Address\n- **Date:** August 28, 1963\n- **Location:** Lincoln Memorial, Washington, D.C.\n- **Age of Speaker:** 23 years old\n- **Source:** NowThis Impact (YouTube Archive)\n- **URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqR9LbT1_w\n- **Classification:** Progressive Dignity (Validation Set)\n- **Historical Significance:** One of the youngest speakers at the March on Washington, Lewis delivered a powerful address calling for immediate civil rights action. This speech helped establish him as a key leader in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\n---\n\n[Applause] We march today for jobs and freedom, but we have nothing to be proud of, for hundreds and thousands of our brothers are not here. They're receiving starvation wages or no wages at all. While we stand here, there are sharecroppers in the Delta of Mississippi who are out in the field working for less than three dollars a day, twelve hours a day. While we stand here, there are students in jail on trumped-up charges. Our brother James Farmer, along with many others, is also in jail.\n\nWe come here today with a great sense of misgiving. It is true that we support the administration's civil rights bill. We support it with great reservations, however. Unless Title Three is put in this bill, there's nothing to protect the young children and old women who must face police dogs and fire hoses in the South while they engage in peaceful demonstrations. In its present form, this bill will not protect the citizens of Danville, Virginia, who must live in constant fear of a police state. It will not protect the hundreds and thousands of people who have been arrested upon trumped-up charges.\n\nWhat about the three young men - SNCC field secretaries in Americus, Georgia - who face the death penalty for engaging in peaceful protest? As it stands now, the voting section of this bill will not help the thousands of black people who want to vote. It will not help the citizens of Mississippi, of Alabama, and Georgia, who are qualified to vote but lack a sixth-grade education.\n\nWe must have legislation that will protect the Mississippi sharecropper who is put off of his farm because he dares to register to vote. We need a bill that will provide for the homeless and starving people of this nation. We need a bill to ensure the equality of a maid who earns five dollars a week in the home of a family whose total income is one hundred thousand dollars a year. We must have a good FEPC bill.\n\nMy friends, let us not forget that we are involved in a serious social revolution. By and large, American politics is dominated by politicians who build their careers on immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political, economic, and social exploitation. There are exceptions, of course - we salute those - but what political leader can stand up and say, \"My party is the party of principles\"? For the party of Kennedy is also the party of Eastland. The party of Javits is also the party of Goldwater.\n\nWhere is our party? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march on Washington? Where is the political party that will make it unnecessary to march in the streets of Birmingham? Where is the political party that will protect the citizens of Albany, Georgia? Do you know that in Albany, Georgia, nine of our leaders have been indicted, not by Dixiecrats, but by the federal government for peaceful protest?\n\nBut what did the federal government do when Albany police deputies beat Attorney C.B. King and left him half-dead? What did the federal government do when local police officials kicked and assaulted the pregnant wife of Slater King, and she lost her baby? To those who have said, \"Be patient and wait,\" we must say that we cannot be patient. We do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now!\n\n[Applause] [Music] [Applause] \n\nWe are tired! We are tired of being beaten by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jails over and over again. And then you holler, \"Be patient.\" How long can we be patient? We want our freedom and we want it now!\n\n[Applause] \n\nWe do not want to go to jail, but we will go to jail if this is the price we must pay for love, brotherhood, and true peace. I appeal to all of you to get in this great revolution that is sweeping this nation. Get in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation until true freedom comes, until the revolution of 1776 is complete.\n\nWe must get in this revolution and complete the revolution. For in the Delta of Mississippi, in southwest Georgia, in the Black Belt of Alabama, in Harlem, in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and all over this nation, the black masses are on the march for jobs and freedom.\n\nThey're talking about slow down and stop. We will not stop! All of the forces of Eastland, Barnett, Wallace, and Thurmond will not stop this revolution!\n\n[Applause] \n\nIf we do not get meaningful legislation out of this Congress, the time will come when we will not confine our marching to Washington. We will march through the South, through the streets of Jackson, through the streets of Danville, through the streets of Cambridge, through the streets of Birmingham. But we will march with the spirit of love and with the spirit of dignity that we have shown here today.\n\n[Music] [Applause] \n\nBy the forces of our demands, our determination, and our numbers, we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in the image of God and democracy. We must say: Wake up America! Wake up! For we cannot stop, and we will not and cannot be patient!\n\n[Applause]\n\n=== obama_2004_dnc.txt ===\n**Barack Obama - 2004 Democratic National Convention Keynote Speech**\n\n**Bibliographic Information:**\n- **Speaker:** Barack Obama, Illinois State Senator and U.S. Senate Candidate\n- **Event:** 2004 Democratic National Convention\n- **Speech Type:** Keynote Address\n- **Date:** July 27, 2004\n- **Location:** Fleet Center, Boston, Massachusetts\n- **Source:** C-SPAN Historic Convention Speeches\n- **URL:** https://www.c-span.org/program/historic-convention-speeches/barack-obama-2004-democratic-national-convention-keynote-speech/193754\n- **Classification:** Progressive Dignity (Validation Set)\n- **Historical Significance:** This keynote address launched Obama into national prominence and is widely regarded as one of the most influential political speeches in modern American history.\n\n---\n\nThank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Dick Durbin. You make us all proud. On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention.\n\nTonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance, my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.\n\nWhile studying here my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor, my grandfather signed up for duty. Joined the army, marched across Europe. Back home my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through F.H.A., and later moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity. And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter.\n\nA common dream born of two continents. My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, believing in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined -- they imagined me going to the best schools in the land even though they weren't rich because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential. They have both passed away now and yet I know that on this night they look down on me with great pride.\n\nThey stand here and I stand here today grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me and that in no other country on earth is my story even possible.\n\nTonight we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation. Not because of the height of our skyscrapers or the power of our military or the size of our economy, our pride is based on a very simple premise. Summed up in a declaration made over 200 years ago. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThat is the true genius of America. A faith in simple dreams. An insistence on small miracles. That we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. And we can say what we think, write what we think without hearing a sudden knock on the door, that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe, that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution and that our votes will be counted, at least most of the time.\n\nThis year in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forebears and the promise of future generations. Fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents, I say to you we have more work to do.\n\nMore work to do for the workers I met in Illinois who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico and now we're having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay $7 an hour, or the father I met that was losing his job and choking back the tears wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on. More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis and thousands more like her who has the grades, has the drive, has the will but doesn't have the money to go to college.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, the people I meet in small towns and big cities and diners and office parks, they don't expect government to solve all of their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to. Go into the counties around Chicago and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or by the Pentagon. Go into any inner city neighborhood and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn. They know the parents have to teach. The children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things.\n\nPeople don't expect government to solve all their problems but they sense deep in their bones that with just a slight change in priorities we could make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life. And that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better and they want that choice.\n\nIn this election we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer and that man is John Kerry. John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because they've defined his life from his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate. He has devoted himself to this country. Again and again we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home. John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves. John Kerry believes in energy independence so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties or use faith as a wedge to divide us. And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes but it should never be the first option.\n\nYou know, a while back -- a while back I met a young man in a V.F.W. hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, 6'2\", clear-eyed with an easy smile. He told me he joined the Marines and was headed to Iraq the following week. As I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service I thought this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child.\n\nBut then I asked myself, are we serving him as well as he's serving us? I thought of the 900 men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who won't be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families I met struggling to get by without a loved one's full income or whose loved one returned with a limb missing but still lack long-term health care benefits because they were reservists.\n\nWhen we send our young men and women into harm's way we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace and earn the respect of the world.\n\nNow let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued. And they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in America. And he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism there's another ingredient in the American saga. A belief that we're all connected as one people. If there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me even if it's not my child. If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription drugs and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer even if it's not my grandparent. If there's an Arab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process that threatens my civil liberties.\n\nIt is that fundamental belief -- it is that fundamental belief I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper that makes this country work. It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one American family. Out of many, one.\n\nNow even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight there is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America. There's the United States of America.\n\nThe pundits, the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states, red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats, but I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and, yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who oppose the war in Iraq and there are patriots who support the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.\n\nIn the end that's what this election is about. Do we participate in the politics of cynicism or in a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here, the willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't think about it or health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. That's not what I'm talking about.\n\nI'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs. The hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores. The hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta, the hope of a mill worker's son who dares to defy the odds, the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. Hope -- hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope.\n\nIn the end that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation, a belief in things not seen. A belief that there are better days ahead. I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with the road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs for the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that we have righteous wind at our backs and as we stand on the crossroads of history we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.\n\nAmerica, tonight if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine the people will rise up in November and John Kerry will be sworn in as president and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president and this country will reclaim its promise and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come.\n\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.\n\n=== obama_2012_dnc_acceptance_speech.txt ===\n**Barack Obama - 2012 Democratic National Convention Acceptance Speech**\n\n**Bibliographic Information:**\n- **Speaker:** Barack Obama, 44th President of the United States\n- **Event:** 2012 Democratic National Convention\n- **Speech Type:** Presidential Nomination Acceptance Address\n- **Date:** September 6, 2012\n- **Location:** Time Warner Cable Arena, Charlotte, North Carolina\n- **Source:** NPR Transcript (Federal News Service)\n- **URL:** https://www.npr.org/2012/09/06/160713941/transcript-president-obamas-convention-speech\n- **Classification:** Progressive Dignity (Validation Set)\n- **Historical Significance:** Obama's acceptance speech for his re-election campaign, delivered during his presidency, reflecting on first-term achievements and outlining his vision for a second term.\n\n---\n\nPresident Obama gives his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., on Thursday. Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you. (Sustained cheers, applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.\n\nMichelle, I love you so much. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nA few nights ago, everybody was reminded just what a lucky man I am. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nMalia and Sasha, we are so proud of you. (Cheers, applause.) And yes, you do have to go to school in the morning. (Chuckles.) (Laughter, applause.)\n\nAnd Joe Biden, thank you for being the very best vice president I could have ever hoped for \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 and being a strong and loyal friend.\n\nMadam Chairwoman, delegates, I accept your nomination for president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Now, the first time I addressed this convention, in 2004, I was a younger man \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 a Senate candidate from Illinois who spoke about hope, not blind optimism, not wishful thinking but hope in the face of difficulty, hope in the face of uncertainty, that dogged faith in the future which has pushed this nation forward even when the odds are great, even when the road is long.\n\nEight years later that hope has been tested by the cost of war, by one of the worst economic crises in history and by political gridlock that's left us wondering whether it's still even possible to tackle the challenges of our time. I know campaigns can seem small, even silly sometimes.\n\nTrivial things become big distractions. Serious issues become sound bites. The truth gets buried under an avalanche of money and advertising. And if you're sick of hearing me approve this message, believe me, so am I. (Laughter, cheers, applause.)\n\nBut when all is said and done, when you pick up that ballot to vote, you will face the clearest choice of any time in a generation. (Cheers.) Over the next few years big decisions will be made in Washington on jobs, the economy, taxes and deficits, energy, education, war and peace \u2014 decisions that will have a huge impact on our lives and on our children's lives for decades to come.\n\nAnd on every issue, the choice you face won't just be between two candidates or two parties. It will be a choice between two different paths for America, a choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future. Ours is a fight to restore the values that built the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world has ever known \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 the values my grandfather defended as a soldier in Patton's army, the values that drove my grandmother to work on a bomber assembly line while he was gone. They knew they were part of something larger \u2014 a nation that triumphed over fascism and depression, a nation where the most innovative businesses turn out the world's best products, and everyone shared in that pride and success from the corner office to the factory floor.\n\nMy grandparents were given the chance to go to college and buy their home \u2014 their own home and fulfill the basic bargain at the heart of America's story, the promise that hard work will pay off, that responsibility will be rewarded, that everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same rules, from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington, D.C. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd I ran for president because I saw that basic bargain slipping away. I began my career helping people in the shadow of a shuttered steel mill at a time when too many good jobs were starting to move overseas. And by 2008 we had seen nearly a decade in which families struggled with costs that kept rising but paychecks that didn't, folks racking up more and more debt just to make the mortgage or pay tuition, put gas in the car or food on the table. And when the house of cards collapsed in the Great Recession, millions of innocent Americans lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings, a tragedy from which we're still fighting to recover.\n\nNow, our friends down in Tampa at the Republican convention were more than happy to talk about everything they think is wrong with America. But they didn't have much to say about how they'd make it right. (Cheers, applause.) They want your vote, but they don't want you to know their plan. And that's because all they have to offer is the same prescriptions they've had for the last 30 years. Have a surplus? Try a tax cut. Deficit too high \u2014 try another.\n\nFeel a cold coming on? Take two tax cuts, roll back some regulations, and call us in the morning. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nNow, I've cut taxes for those who need it \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 middle-class families, small businesses. But I don't believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs to our shores, or pay down our deficit. I don't believe that firing teachers or kicking students off financial aid will grow the economy \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 or help us compete with the scientists and engineers coming out of China. After all we've been through, I don't believe that rolling back regulations on Wall Street will help the small-businesswoman expand, or the laid-off construction worker keep his home.\n\nWe have been there, we've tried that, and we're not going back. We are moving forward, America. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nNow, I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy. I never have. You didn't elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear. You elected me to tell you the truth. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd the truth is, it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades. It'll require common effort, shared responsibility, and the kind of bold, persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd by the way, those of us who carry on his party's legacy should remember that not every problem can be remedied with another government program or dictate from Washington.\n\nBut know this, America: Our problems can be solved. (Cheers, applause.) Our challenges can be met. (Applause.) The path we offer may be harder, but it leads to a better place, and I'm asking you to choose that future. (Applause.)\n\nI'm asking you to rally around a set of goals for your country, goals in manufacturing, energy, education, national security and the deficit, real, achievable plans that will lead to new jobs, more opportunity and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation. That's what we can do in the next four years, and that is why I am running for a second term as president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nWe can choose a future where we export more products and outsource fewer jobs. After a decade that was defined by what we bought and borrowed, we're getting back to basics and doing what America's always done best. We are making things again. (Applause.) I've met workers in Detroit and Toledo who feared \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 they'd never build another American car. And today they can't build them fast enough because we reinvented a dying auto industry that's back on the top of the world. (Cheers, applause.) I worked with business leaders who are bringing jobs back to America not because our workers make less pay, but because we make better products \u2014 (cheers) \u2014 because we work harder and smarter than anyone else.\n\n(Cheers, applause.) I've signed trade agreements that are helping our companies sell more goods to millions of new customers, goods that are stamped with three proud words: \"Made in America.\" (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: (Chanting.) USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: And after a decade of decline, this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last 2 1/2 years. (Cheers.) And now you have a choice. We can give more tax breaks to corporations that shift jobs overseas --\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: No!\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: \u2014 or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs here in the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.) We can help big factories and small businesses double their exports. And if we choose this path, we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next four years. You can make that happen. (Cheers, applause.) You can choose that future.\n\nYou can choose the path where we control more of our own energy. After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. (Cheers, applause.) We have doubled our use of renewable energy, and thousands of Americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries. (Cheers, applause.) In the last year alone, we cut oil imports by 1 million barrels a day, more than any administration in recent history. (Cheers, applause.) And today the United States of America is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decades. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nSo now you have a choice between a strategy that reverses this progress or one that builds on it.\n\nWe've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration in the last three years, and we'll open more. But unlike my opponent, I will not let oil companies write this country's energy plan or endanger our coastlines or collect another $4 billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers. (Cheers, applause.) We're offering a better path.\n\nWe're offering a better path where we \u2014 a future where we keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal, where farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and trucks, where construction workers build homes and factories that waste less energy, where \u2014 where we develop a hundred-year supply of natural gas that's right beneath our feet. If you choose this path, we can cut our oil imports in half by 2020 and support more than 600,000 new jobs in natural gas alone. (Cheers, applause.\n\nAnd yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet, because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. (Cheers, applause.) They are a threat to our children's future.\n\nAnd in this election, you can do something about it. (Cheers, applause.) You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete, no matter how old they are or how much money they have.\n\nEducation was the gateway to opportunity for me. (Cheers.) It was the gateway for Michelle. It was \u2014 it was the gateway for most of you. And now more than ever it is the gateway to a middle-class life.\n\nFor the first time in a generation, nearly every state has answered our call to raise their standards for teaching and learning. (Cheers, applause.) Some of the worst schools in the country have made real gains in math and reading. Millions of students are paying less for college today because we finally took on a system that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on banks and lenders. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd now you have a choice. We can gut education, or we can decide that in the United States of America, no child should have her dreams deferred because of a crowded classroom or a crumbling school. No family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don't have the money. (Cheers, applause.) No company should have to look for workers overseas because they couldn't find any with the right skills here at home. (Cheers, applause.) That's not our future. That is not our future. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nA government has a role in this. But teachers must inspire. Principals must lead. Parents must instill a thirst for learning. And students, you've got to do the work. (Cheers, applause.) And together, I promise you we can outeducate and outcompete any nation on earth. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nSo help me. Help me recruit a hundred thousand math and science teachers within 10 years and improve early childhood education. (Cheers, applause.) Help give 2 million workers the chance to learn skills at their community college that will lead directly to a job. Help us work with colleges and universities to cut in half the growth of tuition costs over the next 10 years.\n\nWe can meet that goal together. (Cheers, applause.) You can choose that future for America. (Cheers, applause.) That's our future.\n\nYou know, in a world of new threats and new challenges, you can choose leadership that has been tested and proven. Four years ago I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did. (Cheers, applause.) I promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have. (Cheers, applause.) We've blunted the Taliban's momentum in Afghanistan and in 2014, our longest war will be over. (Cheers, applause.) A new tower rises above the New York skyline, al- Qaida is on the path to defeat and Osama bin Laden is dead. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd tonight we pay tribute to the Americans who still serve in harm's way. We are forever in debt to a generation whose sacrifice has made this country safer and more respected. We will never forget you, and so long as I'm commander in chief, we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known. (Cheers, applause.) When you take off the uniform, we will serve you as well as you've served us, because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head or the care that they need when they come home.\n\n(Cheers, applause.)\n\nAround the world, we've strengthened old alliances and forged new coalitions to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. We've reasserted our power across the Pacific and stood up to China on behalf of our workers. From Burma to Libya to South Sudan, we have advanced the rights and dignity of all human beings \u2014 (cheers) \u2014 men and women; Christians and Muslims and Jews. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nBut for all the progress that we've made, challenges remain. Terrorist plots must be disrupted. Europe's crisis must be contained. Our commitment to Israel's security must not waver, and neither must our pursuit of peace. (Cheers, applause.) The Iranian government must face a world that stays united against its nuclear ambitions. The historic change sweeping across the Arab world must be defined not by the iron fist of a dictator or the hate of extremists, but by the hopes and aspirations of ordinary people who are reaching for the same rights that we celebrate here today. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nSo now we have a choice. My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy. (Laughter, applause.)\n\nBut from all that we've seen and heard, they want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly.\n\nAfter all, you don't call Russia our number one enemy \u2014 not al- Qaida, Russia \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 unless you're still stuck in a Cold War mind warp. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nYou might not be ready for diplomacy with Beijing if you can't visit the Olympics without insulting our closest ally.\n\n(Laughter, cheers, applause.)\n\nMy opponent \u2014 my opponent said that it was tragic to end the war in Iraq. And he won't tell us how he'll end the war in Afghanistan. Well, I have, and I will. (Cheers, applause.) And while my opponent would spend more money on military hardware that our Joint Chiefs don't even want, I will use the money we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work \u2014 (extended cheers, applause) \u2014 rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and runways, because after two wars that have cost us thousands of lives and over a trillion dollars, it's time to do some nation building right here at home. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nYou can choose a future where we reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class. (Cheers, applause.) Independent experts say that my plan would cut our deficit by $4 trillion. (Cheers.) And last summer I worked with Republicans in Congress to cut a billion dollars in spending, because those of us who believe government can be a force for good should work harder than anyone to reform it so that it's leaner and more efficient and more responsive to the American people. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nI want to reform the tax code so that it's simple, fair and asks the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over $250,000 \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 the same rate we had when Bill Clinton was president, the same rate we had when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs, the biggest surplus in history and a whole lot of millionaires to boot.\n\n(Applause.)\n\nNow, I'm still eager to reach an agreement based on the principles of my bipartisan debt commission. No party has a monopoly on wisdom. No democracy works without compromise. I want to get this done, and we can get it done.\n\nBut when Governor Romney and his friends in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficits by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy, well \u2014 (boos) \u2014 what'd Bill Clinton call it? You do the arithmetic. (Laughter, cheers, applause.) You do the math.\n\nI refuse to go along with that, and as long as I'm president, I never will. (Cheers, applause.) I refuse to ask middle-class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut. (Cheers, applause.) I refuse to ask students to pay more for college or kick children out of Head Start programs to eliminate health insurance for millions of Americans who are poor and elderly or disabled all so those with the most can pay less. I'm not going along with that. (Continued cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd I will never \u2014 I will never turn Medicare into a voucher. (Cheers, applause.) No American should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies. They should retire with the care and the dignity that they have earned. Yes, we will reform and strengthen Medicare for the long haul, but we'll do it by reducing the cost of health care, not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more.\n\n(Cheers, applause.) And we will keep the promise of Social Security by taking the responsible steps to strengthen it, not by turning it over to Wall Street. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nThis is the choice we now face. This is what the election comes down to. Over and over, we've been told by our opponents that bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations are the only way, that since government can't do everything, it should do almost nothing. If you can't afford health insurance, hope that you don't get sick. (Murmurs of disapproval.) If a company releases toxic pollution into the air your children breathe, well, that's the price of progress. If you can't afford to start a business or go to college, take my opponent's advice and borrow money from your parents. (Laughter, mixed cheers and boos, applause.)\n\nYou know what, that's not who we are. That's not what this country is about. As Americans, we believe we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, rights that no man or government can take away. We insist on personal responsibility, and we celebrate individual initiative. We're not entitled to success. We have to earn it. We honor the strivers, the dreamers, the risk- takers, the entrepreneurs who have always been the driving force behind our free enterprise system, the greatest engine of growth and prosperity that the world's ever known.\n\nBut we also believe in something called citizenship \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 citizenship, a word at the very heart of our founding, a word at the very essence of our democracy, the idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations.\n\nWe believe that when a CEO pays his autoworkers enough to buy the cars that they build, the whole company does better. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nWe believe that when a family can no longer be tricked into signing a mortgage they can't afford, that family's protected, but so is the value of other people's homes \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 and so is the entire economy. (Applause.)\n\nWe believe the little girl who's offered an escape from poverty by a great teacher or a grant for college could become the next Steve Jobs or the scientist who cures cancer or the president of the United States \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 and it is in our power to give her that chance. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nWe know that churches and charities can often make more of a difference than a poverty program alone. We don't want handouts for people who refuse to help themselves, and we certainly don't want bailouts for banks that break the rules. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nWe don't think the government can solve all of our problems, but we don't think the government is the source of all of our problems \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 any more than our welfare recipients or corporations or unions or immigrants or gays or any other group we're told to blame for our troubles \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 because \u2014 because America, we understand that this democracy is ours.\n\nWe, the people \u2014 (cheers) \u2014 recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which asks only, what's in it for me, a freedom without a commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals, and those who died in their defense. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAs citizens, we understand that America is not about what can be done for us. It's about what can be done by us, together \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self-government. That's what we believe.\n\nSo you see, the election four years ago wasn't about me. It was about you. (Cheers, applause.) My fellow citizens \u2014 you were the change. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nYou're the reason there's a little girl with a heart disorder in Phoenix who'll get the surgery she needs because an insurance company can't limit her coverage. You did that. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nYou're the reason a young man in Colorado who never thought he'd be able to afford his dream of earning a medical degree is about to get that chance. You made that possible. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nYou're the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she's ever called home \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 why selfless soldiers won't be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love, why thousands of families have finally been able to say to the loved ones who served us so bravely, welcome home. (Cheers, applause.) Welcome home. You did that. You did that. (Cheers, applause.) You did that.\n\nIf you turn away now \u2014 if you turn away now, if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for isn't possible, well, change will not happen. If you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference, then other voices will fill the void, the lobbyists and special interests, the people with the $10 million checks who are trying to buy this election and those who are trying to make it harder for you to vote, Washington politicians who want to decide who you can marry or control health care choices that women should be making for themselves. (Cheers, applause.) Only you can make sure that doesn't happen. Only you have the power to move us forward.\n\nYou know, I recognize that times have changed since I first spoke to this convention. Times have changed, and so have I. I'm no longer just a candidate. I'm the president. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAnd \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and that's --\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Four more years! Four more years!\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: And that \u2014 and that means I know what it means to send young Americans into battle, for I've held in my arms the mothers and fathers of those who didn't return.\n\nI've shared the pain of families who've lost their homes, and the frustration of workers who've lost their jobs. If the critics are right that I've made all my decisions based on polls, then I must not be very good at reading them. (Laughter.)\n\nAnd while I'm proud of what we've achieved together \u2014 (cheers) \u2014 I'm far more mindful of my own failings, knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said, \"I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go.\" , for I have held in my arms the mothers and fathers of those who didn't return. I've shared the pain of families who've lost their homes, and the frustration of workers who've lost their jobs. If the critics are right that I've made all my decisions based on polls, then I must not be very good at reading them. And while I'm proud of what we've achieved together, I'm far more mindful of my own failings, knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said, \"I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go.\" (Cheers, applause.)\n\nBut as I stand here tonight, I have never been more hopeful about America. (Cheers, applause.) Not because I think I have all the answers. Not because I'm naive about the magnitude of our challenges.\n\nI'm hopeful because of you.\n\nThe young woman I met at a science fair who won national recognition for her biology research while living with her family at a homeless shelter \u2014 she gives me hope. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nThe auto worker who won the lottery after his plant almost closed, but kept coming to work every day, and bought flags for his whole town and one of the cars that he built to surprise his wife \u2014 he gives me hope.\n\n(Cheers, applause.)\n\nThe family business in Warroad, Minnesota, that didn't lay off a single one of their 4,000 employees when the recession hit \u2014 (cheers, applause) \u2014 even when their competitors shut down dozens of plants, even when it meant the owner gave up some perks and some pay because they understood that their biggest asset was the community and the workers who had helped build that business \u2014 they give me hope. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nI think about the young sailor I met at Walter Reed Hospital still recovering from a grenade attack that would cause him to have his leg amputated above the knee. And six months ago we would watch him walk into a White House dinner honoring those who served in Iran (sic; Iraq) \u2014 tall and 20 pounds heavier, dashing in his uniform, with a big grin on his face, sturdy on his new leg. And I remember how a few months after that I would watch him on a bicycle, racing with his fellow wounded warriors on a sparkling spring day, inspiring other heroes who had just begun the hard path he had traveled. He gives me hope. (Cheers, applause.) He gives me hope.\n\nI don't know what party these men and women belong to. I don't know if they'll vote for me. But I know that their spirit defines us. They remind me, in the words of Scripture, that ours is a future filled with hope. (Cheers.) And if you share that faith with me, if you share that hope with me, I ask you tonight for your vote.\n\n(Cheers, applause.)\n\nIf you reject the notion that this nation's promise is reserved for the few, your voice must be heard in this election. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nIf you reject the notion that our government is forever beholden to the highest bidder, you need to stand up in this election. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nIf you believe that new plants and factories can dot our landscape, that new energy can power our future, that new schools can provide ladders of opportunity to this nation of dreamers, if you believe in a country where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same rules, then I need you to vote this November. (Cheers, applause.)\n\nAmerica, I never said this journey would be easy, and I won't promise that now. Yes, our path is harder, but it leads to a better place. (Cheers.) Yes, our road is longer, but we travel it together. (Cheers.)\n\nWe don't turn back. We leave no one behind. (Cheers.) We pull each other up. (Cheers, applause.) We draw strength from our victories. (Cheers, applause.) And we learn from our mistakes. But we keep our eyes fixed on that distant horizon knowing that providence is with us and that we are surely blessed to be citizens of the greatest nation on earth.\n\nThank you, God bless you and God bless these United States. (Cheers, applause.)\n\n=== tishaura_jones_2021_inaugural_address.txt ===\nTitle: Inaugural Address by Mayor Tishaura Jones\nSpeaker: Mayor Tishaura O. Jones\nDate: April 20, 2021\nEvent: Mayoral Inauguration Ceremony\nLocation: St. Louis City Hall, St. Louis, Missouri\nSource: YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHwUGuV_doc (live stream)\nChannel: KSDK News\nDuration: Approximately 20 minutes (extracted from 118-minute ceremony at t=5250)\nHistorical Significance: Historic inaugural address by Tishaura Jones upon becoming the first Black woman mayor of St. Louis, Missouri. Notable for its comprehensive vision of equity, inclusion, and progressive reform addressing systemic racism, public safety reform, and economic justice. Delivered during a pivotal moment in American urban politics following nationwide protests for racial justice.\n\n---\n\nThank you. Love you too. Good afternoon, St. Louis. My name is Tishaura Jones.\n\nLet me back up because I got to pay honor to my mama. My name is Tishaura Onita Jones. My pronouns are she, her, hers. I am the daughter of Lara and Vervis, sister to Chelsea and Ida, mother of Aiden, daughter of Walnut Park, Wells Goodfellow, and Hamilton Heights neighborhoods. And because of you, I am the mayor of the city of St. Louis.\n\nSometimes when I stop and think about it, I'm overwhelmed with disbelief that today's events are real. I keep pinching myself - did that really happen? Today serves as a reminder of what our city can be when we summon the best within ourselves and come together around a positive vision of change and opportunity for all in our city.\n\nMy thoughts also return to this building when a community activist arrived with his wife and nine-year-old daughter in tow. She was a scrawny little thing with hair in two pigtails. Well, that little girl was me, and that activist was Vervis Jones. And 40 years ago tomorrow, he was sworn in as the first Black alderman from the 27th Ward in the city of St. Louis.\n\nI'm aware, as I'm sure the comptroller, the president of the board, and many of our citywide elected leaders can also attest, that I am standing on stone that was not built for me. I am speaking in a rotunda that never envisioned my ascent to mayor. I'm going to walk into an office that my ancestors could have never imagined me working in. But I'm here.\n\nI'm here today because of my grandparents who migrated from the Jim Crow South in search of a better life for their children, my parents and their siblings. Eddie and Daisy Whitfield migrated from Louisiana and Mississippi, and Charlie and Angeline Greene came from Tennessee and Mississippi.\n\nI'm here today because of my parents, Vervis and Lara, who raised their only child in North St. Louis and Walnut Park, in South St. Louis and Shaw, whose families lived in Hamilton Heights, Wells Goodfellow, and East St. Louis, Illinois.\n\nI'm here today as a product of the voluntary desegregation program, which bused me from North St. Louis to the Affton School District from fifth grade until I graduated from high school.\n\nI'm here today as the proud graduate of Hampton University, one of the oldest historically Black colleges and universities in the country, or otherwise affectionately known by its graduates as \"our home by the sea.\"\n\nI'm here as a proud graduate of St. Louis University School of Public Health. I'm here today as a proud participant of Harvard University's Executives in State and Local Government. I'm here today as the proud alum of the Aspen Institute Rodel Fellowship, the Council of State Governments' Henry Toll Fellowship, and a New Deal Leader.\n\nI'm here today as a proud member of the St. Louis Metropolitan Alumni Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated.\n\nI'm here today as the proud chairwoman of the 2020 Bipartisan Justice Center and the chair of the newly formed Black Bank Fund. I'm here today as a former legislator, assistant minority floor leader, and city treasurer. I'm here today as the proud single mother of the most adorable 13-year-old son, Aiden, who, by the way - he's looking - could not be bothered to be here today.\n\nAnd I'm here today as the proud big sister of Ida Victoria and Chelsea Alexis. And most importantly, I'm here today because of you - because you voted, because you got involved, and because you chose to be inspired by a movement of people and a vision for St. Louis seeking to move our city and our region forward.\n\nWhen I announced that I was running for mayor, I said that whether you lived in Penrose or Holly Hills, South Broadway or Natural Bridge, I wanted to be your mayor. I wanted to be the people's mayor. My commitment to you is that I will be a mayor for you and your family, whether you supported me or not.\n\nMost St. Louisans share some core desires, and as a single mom, I know these desires well myself. I want to raise my son in a safe neighborhood. I want him to receive a quality education. I want him to be able to envision himself safely raising a family in St. Louis one day as well.\n\nWe want all our children to grow and learn and develop, to play in the dirt, to run around outside, occasionally scrape their knee on the concrete or slide, or make mistakes, and sometimes stay out too late. Unfortunately, our city has not always protected our children. We have not always fought for every neighborhood. And often, those neighborhoods just off Natural Bridge or South Broadway, and the people who live there, have been forgotten and left behind.\n\nI stand here before you today resolved to make change, to transform our city, and to transform our approach to safety. I stand ready to begin putting equity for people - not equity for wealthy developers - at the center of our planning, in the center of our development. Development is crucial to the success of our city, but we cannot abandon our most precious resource, our people, in exchange for handouts to the rich and well-connected.\n\nBut I am not naive in my pursuit of progressive public policy. I am aware that I am walking into an office that is tasked with working to solve some of our most pressing challenges: lack of opportunity for our most vulnerable, a broken criminal justice system, and a fractured region. I ask for grace as my team and I work to combat decades upon decades of disinvestment.\n\nOur city stands at a pivotal moment in our history. The decisions we make for the next four years, during my first term as mayor, will begin to chart the course for our future. Decades of problems will not be solved by days or months of solutions. And my colleague to the west, the north, and the south, County Executive Sam Page, put it like this when we met with him and his staff last week: sometimes when addressing an incredible challenge, it takes six months to see progress and a year to see real change.\n\nMy team and I have collected input from the people of the city of St. Louis to inform our first steps in re-envisioning and re-imagining public safety, reforming our broken and regressive tax system, working to eradicate and finally dismiss the powerful forces of racism and inequity that have held us back.\n\nThe work ahead of us will be challenging. It will not be easy, and the conversations will not be comfortable. But Vice President Kamala Harris frequently says that our dreams of what we can be cannot be burdened by what we have been.\n\nMoving forward, I will make it my task and mandate to begin convening my partners in city government, our leaders to the west and the east, and you, the people of St. Louis, to have the tough and uncomfortable conversations. We should ask ourselves: Why is it that our politics is so divisive? Why does racism become magnified during an election year, even as it rides the underbelly of strategic messaging? Why do we live in a city whose police department is supposedly understaffed but is larger than any other city our size? Do people who look like me and my son and my dad have a life expectancy that is a fraction of our white neighbors?\n\nBeginning to answer these questions will be crucial to our shared success. When we realize that the success of Black communities and white communities, and the success of Hispanic and Asian communities, and the success of Muslim and Jewish communities, and the success of our gay and straight and trans communities, and the success of all of our communities are linked, we will move forward.\n\nWe will move forward when we recognize our shared humanity, our shared core desires, and our common resolve to make our city a better, safer, and healthier place to live.\n\nHere's my dream for St. Louis. It's ambitious, but it's possible. Our children will play as I did when I was a child - riding bikes around the neighborhood, playing double dutch and hopscotch, laughing with friends, going to good quality schools. Our communities will be rich and prosperous from north to south. They will be hubs of culture, opportunity, access to jobs, health care, and education.\n\nOur public safety department will be staffed with many types of professionals so that when you call 911, you get the right professional most capable of meeting your needs. Our COVID-19 vaccine will get into as many arms as possible, and our outreach to the vaccine-hesitant communities will take priority. Our recovery from the crisis we are facing will be equitable and people-focused.\n\nMy dream is for a public discourse that is characterized by debates of public policy and not debates of personality. So yes, you may say that I, like Dr. King, did have a dream. I have a dream that I know that we can achieve.\n\nI have a dream that my son - I have a dream that your son and daughter and your non-binary child will be judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin or their expression of gender or the way in which they love.\n\nI have a dream that St. Louis will break the chains that have held us back and build a new St. Louis - a St. Louis that is strong, confident, equitable, united, and inclusive.\n\nI have a dream that one day we will rise to new heights of freedom and equity. We instill new faith in those who have been knocked down but have refused to be knocked out, that their government is working for them.\n\nAmanda Gorman, a young woman who delivered the poem at President Biden's inauguration, said this: \"And yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge a union with purpose, to compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters, and conditions of man.\"\n\nAnd so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. St. Louis, there is a challenge before us, but I know that together we will solve it. The forces of good will always shut down and shut out the forces of evil. Light will drive out darkness. Love will overcome hate.\n\nI'm ready to get to work. So to any single mother wondering how they make ends meet, I have seen you, and I'm ready to work for you. To those in our city who are looking to city hall for help, I've seen you, and I'm ready to work for you. To the LGBTQ+ youth who wonder whether St. Louis is a home for them, I have seen you, and I'm ready to work for you. To all of you, I have seen you, and I'm ready to serve.\n\nMy name is Tishaura Onita Jones. I use the she/her pronouns, and I am the mayor of the city of St. Louis.\n\nI'm ready to serve you. God bless you. God bless St. Louis. Thank you very much.",
