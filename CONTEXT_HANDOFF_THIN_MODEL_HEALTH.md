# Context Handoff: THIN Model Health Management System

## Summary of Work Completed

Successfully implemented intelligent model health management using THIN architecture principles. The system now detects broken models, gets intelligent recommendations from agents, adjusts configurations, and executes with only healthy models.

## Key Implementation Details

### Core Architecture
- **EnsembleConfigurationAgent**: Provides intelligent health recommendations (proceed/substitute/cancel)
- **soar_cli.py**: Applies health adjustments before passing to orchestrator
- **ensemble_orchestrator.py**: Reads experiment config directly from file (not stale validation results)

### Critical Bug Fixes
1. **Statistical Analysis Issue**: Fixed orchestrator to use `_spawn_analysis_agents` instead of `_execute_planned_analysis` for multi-run execution
2. **Configuration Staleness**: Orchestrator now reads experiment.md directly instead of validation_results
3. **Model Registry**: Added ollama/mistral to models.yaml with proper timeout configuration
4. **Execution Hangs**: Removed problematic ollama/mistral from experiment configurations

### Current Working State
- **Health Check Flow**: `health check → recommend → adjust → execute → analyze`
- **Reliable Models**: vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro, anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
- **Statistical Analysis**: Cronbach's Alpha tests working with proper multi-run execution
- **Test Experiment**: projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/ runs successfully

## Technical Context

### Model Health Management
```python
# In soar_cli.py
def _apply_model_health_adjustments(validation_result, experiment_path):
    """Apply model health recommendations from EnsembleConfigurationAgent"""
    # Reads experiment.md, applies recommendations, re-validates
```

### Key Files Modified
- `discernus/agents/ensemble_configuration_agent.py`: Model health assessment
- `soar_cli.py`: Health adjustment integration
- `discernus/orchestration/ensemble_orchestrator.py`: Configuration handling fixes
- `discernus/gateway/models.yaml`: Model registry updates

### Model Registry Requirements
- Models must exist in `discernus/gateway/models.yaml` even if they work via LiteLLM
- Local models (ollama/*) can pass health checks but may hang on complex prompts
- Cloud models are more reliable for production analysis pipelines

### Statistical Analysis Requirements
- Multi-run experiments need `analysis_matrix` populated with multiple runs
- Cronbach's Alpha requires `num_runs > 1` in experiment configuration
- Use `_spawn_analysis_agents` for proper multi-run handling

## Current System State

### Working
✅ Model health detection and recommendations  
✅ Configuration adjustment based on agent recommendations  
✅ Multi-run statistical analysis execution  
✅ Cloud model reliability (Gemini, Claude)  
✅ End-to-end experiment execution  

### Known Issues
⚠️ Local models (ollama/*) cause execution hangs on complex prompts  
⚠️ Model registry requires explicit configuration for all models  

## Next Steps / Potential Areas for Improvement

1. **Model Registry Automation**: Auto-detect available models instead of manual configuration
2. **Local Model Reliability**: Investigate timeout/retry strategies for local models
3. **Health Check Expansion**: Add more sophisticated health metrics beyond basic API calls
4. **Performance Optimization**: Parallel model health checks for faster startup

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run health check and execution
python3 soar_cli.py projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/framework.md projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/experiment.md projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/corpus/

# Check results
ls projects/attesor/experiments/05_deeper_smoke_test/results/
```

## Architecture Philosophy

This implementation follows THIN principles:
- **Minimal Code**: Health management is ~50 lines of integration code
- **Agent Intelligence**: EnsembleConfigurationAgent provides smart recommendations
- **No Custom Logic**: Uses existing validation and orchestration infrastructure
- **Bulletproof Infrastructure**: Leverages LiteLLM for model management

The system demonstrates "easier to do the right thing, harder to do the wrong thing" by automatically filtering broken models and providing intelligent fallbacks.

## Memory Notes

The user strongly prefers:
- THIN architecture over THICK implementations
- Agent-based intelligence over hardcoded logic
- Framework-agnostic solutions
- Structured planning with explicit sign-off before execution
- Concise responses over verbose explanations

Current experiment locations use project-specific directories (e.g., `projects/attesor/experiments/`) not top-level experiments folder.
