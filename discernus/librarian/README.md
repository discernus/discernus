# DiscernusLibrarian Directory Structure

This directory contains all outputs and working files for the **DiscernusLibrarian** - Discernus's literature review and validation specialist.

## üéØ Raison d'√ätre

**Why This Tool Exists**: Academic research requires systematic literature review and validation, but manual literature review is time-consuming, inconsistent, and often incomplete. Researchers need a tool that can execute **systematic, multi-stage literature reviews** with full transparency and academic rigor.

**The Problem It Solves**:
- Literature reviews are often ad-hoc and lack systematic methodology
- Research validation lacks transparency into the review process
- Academic grounding requires access to current literature and citation networks
- Manual literature review is too slow for iterative framework development

**The Solution**: An AI-powered literature review specialist that executes systematic research workflows, provides complete transparency into methodology, and delivers both human-readable reports and machine-readable data for integration with other research tools.

### `/reports/`
**Human-readable markdown reports** from literature review sessions
- Format: `discernus_librarian_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`
- Contains: Final synthesis, validation process summary, transparency metrics
- Purpose: Primary deliverable for researchers and stakeholders

### `/research_data/`
**Raw research data** in JSON format for programmatic access
- Format: `discernus_librarian_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`
- Contains: Full research workflow data, LLM responses, process metadata
- Purpose: Debugging, analysis, integration with other systems

### `/archives/`
**Archived research sessions** organized by date/topic
- Long-term storage for completed research
- Organized by: `/archives/YYYY-MM/topic_name/`
- Purpose: Historical reference, pattern analysis, methodology improvement
