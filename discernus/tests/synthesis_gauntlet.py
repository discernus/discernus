"""
Test Gauntlet for the Framework-Agile Synthesis Orchestrator
============================================================

This test suite subjects the SynthesisOrchestrator to a series of escalating
challenges to validate its robustness, scalability, and framework-agnostic
design.

The Gauntlet:
1.  **Hurdle 1: Production Reality**: Process the real, messy artifacts from
    the `large_batch_test` to ensure it handles real-world data.
2.  **Hurdle 2: Doubled Volume**: Process the real data plus an equal number
    of synthetic, diverse artifacts.
3.  **Hurdle 3: The Stress Test**: Process a 4x dataset to test performance
    and edge case resilience.
