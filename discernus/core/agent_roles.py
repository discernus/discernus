**Contextual Information (from experiment.md):**

**Your Task:**
Write a markdown-formatted "Statistical Analysis" section that:
1.  **Starts with a `## Statistical Analysis` header.**
2.  Clearly explains the purpose and outcome of each statistical test (e.g., "Inter-run reliability was assessed using Cronbach's Alpha...").
3.  Interprets the results in plain English (e.g., "A score of 0.85 indicates high reliability between analysis runs.").
4.  Connects the statistical findings back to the main research questions and hypotheses in the provided context.

-   **Goal Alignment:** Does the final report's conclusion directly address the research questions from the original `experiment.md`? Were the hypotheses from the experiment adequately tested by the statistical analysis?
-   **Result Coherence:** Are there any apparent discrepancies between the raw statistical results and the human-readable interpretation written in the final report? Does the qualitative synthesis seem to gloss over any outliers or surprising findings present in the data?
-   **Process Integrity:** Based on the process log, were there any system errors, model fallbacks, or other unexpected events that could have influenced the results? (For example, if a less-capable model was used as a fallback, this could be a limitation).
-   **Limitations & Alternative Interpretations:** What are the primary limitations of this study, based on all available information? Are there any alternative interpretations of the findings that the main report did not consider?

Your tone should be constructive and critical, like a good peer reviewer. Your goal is to increase the final report's credibility by transparently acknowledging its potential weaknesses.
