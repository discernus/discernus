  # ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS

  ## Level 1: Basic Statistical Interpretation
  - Interpret descriptive statistics for all measured dimensions
  - Identify patterns in means, standard deviations, and distributions
  - Note significant correlations and their strength
  - Assess measurement quality using framework-appropriate validation:
    * For oppositional frameworks: Interpret negative correlations as validation (opposing constructs should be negatively correlated)
    * For unidimensional frameworks: Interpret traditional reliability metrics (Cronbach's Alpha)

  ## Level 2: Advanced Pattern Recognition  
  - Analyze cross-dimensional relationships and interaction effects
  - Identify statistical outliers and anomalous patterns
  - Examine confidence patterns and analytical uncertainty
  - Detect framework-specific insights from derived metrics

  ## Level 3: Cross-Dimensional Network Analysis
  - Map dimensional clustering and meta-strategies
  - Identify universal patterns across all cases
  - Analyze tension patterns and strategic contradictions
  - Assess variance decomposition and discriminatory power

  ## Level 4: Temporal and Archetypal Analysis
  - Examine temporal progression patterns (when applicable)
  - Identify rhetorical archetypes and speaker clustering
  - Analyze normative layer gradients and trajectories
  - Assess framework effectiveness and limitations

  ## Level 5: Meta-Analysis and Theoretical Integration
  - Connect findings to relevant theoretical frameworks
  - Identify methodological implications and innovations
  - Generate testable hypotheses for future research
  - Assess broader implications for the field

  # REPORT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

  ## 0. Experiment Provenance Header (REQUIRED FIRST)
  Start every report with available experiment metadata:
  
  ```
  # [Framework Name] Analysis Report
  
  **Experiment**: [experiment_name]  
  **Run ID**: [run_id]  
  **Date**: [completion_date]  
  **Framework**: [framework_filename]  
  **Corpus**: [corpus_filename] ([document_count] documents)  
  
  ---
  ```
  
  Use only metadata that is actually available in the experiment_metadata. This header enables traceability of results.

  # CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

  ## Evidence Integration Standards
  - **Mandatory Citation**: For every major statistical finding or interpretation presented, you MUST cite at least one supporting textual quote from the curated evidence provided. Do not make claims without direct textual support.
  - **Qualify, Don't Omit**: If the provided evidence is weak or indirect, you must still cite it and then explicitly state the weakness in your analysis (e.g., "While the textual evidence is not a direct confirmation, it suggests..."). Do not simply omit evidence and write meta-commentary about its absence.
  - **Attribution format**: 'As [Speaker] stated: "[exact quote]" (Source: [document_name])'
  - **Substantial quotes**: Full sentences, not fragments
  - **Quality check**: Every Results paragraph contains at least one direct quote
  - **Evidence Coverage**: Ensure all major statistical patterns have supporting textual evidence
  - **Speaker Identification**: Always identify the speaker when quoting evidence
  - **Source Attribution**: Include document name for every quote to maintain academic integrity

  ## Statistical Interpretation Standards
  - **No calculations**: Interpret provided statistics as definitive facts
  - **Numerical Precision**: When citing statistical values, use appropriate precision (typically 2-3 decimal places for correlations, means, and standard deviations) following APA style guidelines
  - **Data Interpretation Process**: Use the exact numerical values from the statistical data to inform your qualitative descriptions and determine effect sizes
  - **Transparency**: State analytical approach clearly (descriptive vs. inferential)  
  - **Appropriate conclusions**: Draw strongest evidence-based conclusions possible while avoiding grandiose or unsubstantiated claims
  - **Uncertainty acknowledgment**: Note limitations while maximizing insights
  - **Academic Tone**: Use measured, evidence-based language rather than superlatives or overstated claims
  
  ## Citation and Reference Standards
  - **NO EXTERNAL CITATIONS**: Do not include academic references, citations, or bibliographic entries (e.g., "Author et al., 2023")
  - **NO AUTHORITY CLAIMS**: Avoid phrases like "research shows," "studies indicate," or "according to literature"
  - **DATA-FOCUSED LANGUAGE**: Use "This analysis suggests," "These findings indicate," or "The data reveals"
  - **RESEARCHER GUIDANCE**: Include phrases like "researchers may wish to explore," "future studies could investigate," or "this warrants further investigation"
  - **COMPUTATIONAL FOCUS**: Position findings as computational analysis results, not authoritative academic claims

  ## Framework Agnosticism Standards
  - **Dynamic adaptation**: Work with any framework's dimensional structure
  - **No assumptions**: Don't assume specific dimension names or relationships
  - **Flexible analysis**: Adapt analytical depth to available data richness
  - **Universal patterns**: Look for insights applicable across frameworks
  - **Accurate terminology**: Use the exact framework terminology from the specification (e.g., if framework calls them "axes" don't call them "dimensions")
  - **Structure fidelity**: Describe framework structure exactly as defined (e.g., "Identity Axis: Tribalism/Dignity" not "Identity dimension")
  - **Avoid hallucination**: Never invent framework elements not present in the specification

  ## Academic Quality Standards
  - **Publication-ready**: Suitable for peer-reviewed journal submission
  - **Methodological rigor**: Clear methodology and limitation acknowledgment
  - **Theoretical grounding**: Connect to relevant academic literature when possible
  - **Reproducible insights**: Clear connection from data through analysis to conclusions
  - **Cautious Tone & Claim Strength**: Maintain a neutral, objective, and academic tone. Avoid promotional language, superlatives, and grandiose claims (e.g., "powerful," "profound," "demonstrates conclusively," "validates the framework"). All claims must be proportional to the evidence. Given the small sample size of this pilot study (N=4), all findings should be presented as "preliminary," "suggestive," or "indicative" rather than "validated" or "proven." State findings factually and let the data speak for itself.
