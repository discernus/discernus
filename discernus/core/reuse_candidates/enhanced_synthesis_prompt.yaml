  # ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS

  ## Level 1: Basic Statistical Interpretation
  - Interpret descriptive statistics for all measured dimensions
  - Identify patterns in means, standard deviations, and distributions
  - Note significant correlations and their strength
  - Assess measurement quality using framework-appropriate validation:
    * For oppositional frameworks: Interpret negative correlations as validation (opposing constructs should be negatively correlated)
    * For unidimensional frameworks: Interpret traditional reliability metrics (Cronbach's Alpha)

  ## Level 2: Advanced Pattern Recognition  
  - Analyze cross-dimensional relationships and interaction effects
  - Identify statistical outliers and anomalous patterns
  - Examine confidence patterns and analytical uncertainty
  - Detect framework-specific insights from derived metrics

  ## Level 3: Cross-Dimensional Network Analysis
  - Map dimensional clustering and meta-strategies
  - Identify universal patterns across all cases
  - Analyze tension patterns and strategic contradictions
  - Assess variance decomposition and discriminatory power

  ## Level 4: Temporal and Archetypal Analysis
  - Examine temporal progression patterns (when applicable)
  - Identify rhetorical archetypes and speaker clustering
  - Analyze normative layer gradients and trajectories
  - Assess framework effectiveness and limitations

  ## Level 5: Meta-Analysis and Theoretical Integration
  - Connect findings to relevant theoretical frameworks
  - Identify methodological implications and innovations
  - Generate testable hypotheses for future research
  - Assess broader implications for the field

  # REPORT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

  ## 0. Experiment Provenance Header (REQUIRED FIRST)
  Start every report with available experiment metadata:
  
  ```
  # [Framework Name] Analysis Report
  
  **Experiment**: [experiment_name]  
  **Run ID**: [run_id]  
  **Date**: [completion_date]  
  **Framework**: [framework_filename]  
  **Corpus**: [corpus_filename] ([document_count] documents)  
  
  ---
  ```
  
  Use only metadata that is actually available in the experiment_metadata. This header enables traceability of results.

  # CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

  ## Evidence Integration Standards
  - **Mandatory Citation**: For every major statistical finding or interpretation presented, you MUST cite at least one supporting textual quote retrieved from the RAG evidence database. Do not make claims without direct textual support.
  - **Qualify, Don't Omit**: If the retrieved evidence is weak or indirect, you must still cite it and then explicitly state the weakness in your analysis (e.g., "While the textual evidence is not a direct confirmation, it suggests..."). Do not simply omit evidence and write meta-commentary about its absence.
  - **Attribution format**: 'As [Speaker] stated: "[exact quote]" (Source: [document_name])'
  - **Substantial quotes**: Full sentences, not fragments
  - **Quality check**: Every Results paragraph contains at least one direct quote

  ## Statistical Interpretation Standards
  - **No calculations**: Interpret provided statistics as definitive facts
  - **Statistical Placeholder Mandate**: When you state a finding that requires a specific numerical value, you MUST NOT write the number itself. Instead, you MUST insert a machine-readable placeholder. The arguments for these placeholders MUST be the exact key names copied from the statistical_results input.
  - **Placeholder Format Rules**:
    1. **For Correlation Values**: Use `{{corr(variable1, variable2)}}`. The variable names MUST match the keys in the correlation_matrix. For a key like "fear_raw_vs_hope_raw", your placeholder would be `{{corr(fear_raw, hope_raw)}}`.
    2. **For Descriptive Statistics**: Use `{{desc(document_name, metric_name)}}`. The document_name and metric_name MUST match the keys in the descriptive_statistics object.
  - **Data Interpretation Process**: Use the exact numerical values from the statistical data to inform your qualitative descriptions and determine effect sizes, but replace all numerical citations with the appropriate placeholders.
  - **Transparency**: State analytical approach clearly (descriptive vs. inferential)  
  - **Appropriate conclusions**: Draw strongest evidence-based conclusions possible
  - **Uncertainty acknowledgment**: Note limitations while maximizing insights

  ## Framework Agnosticism Standards
  - **Dynamic adaptation**: Work with any framework's dimensional structure
  - **No assumptions**: Don't assume specific dimension names or relationships
  - **Flexible analysis**: Adapt analytical depth to available data richness
  - **Universal patterns**: Look for insights applicable across frameworks

  ## Academic Quality Standards
  - **Publication-ready**: Suitable for peer-reviewed journal submission
  - **Methodological rigor**: Clear methodology and limitation acknowledgment
  - **Theoretical grounding**: Connect to relevant academic literature when possible
  - **Reproducible insights**: Clear connection from data through analysis to conclusions
  - **Cautious Tone & Claim Strength**: Maintain a neutral, objective, and academic tone. Avoid promotional language, superlatives, and grandiose claims (e.g., "powerful," "profound," "demonstrates conclusively," "validates the framework"). All claims must be proportional to the evidence. Given the small sample size of this pilot study (N=4), all findings should be presented as "preliminary," "suggestive," or "indicative" rather than "validated" or "proven." State findings factually and let the data speak for itself.
