  ## Methodology
  
  This study employs the [Framework Name] analytical framework to examine [research focus] across [document count] documents. The framework operationalizes [key concepts] through systematic dimensional analysis.
  
  **Data Processing**: Documents were analyzed using large language model (LLM) assistance with human oversight and validation. Each text was scored across [number] dimensions using standardized criteria derived from the theoretical framework.
  
  **Measurement Approach**: [Brief explanation of scoring methodology and calculations]
  
  **Quality Assurance**: All computational results were verified through [validation methods]. Statistical analysis included [relevant tests] with appropriate confidence intervals.
