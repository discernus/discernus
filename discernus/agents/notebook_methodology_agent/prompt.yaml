  6. **NO PLACEHOLDERS**: Never use phrases like "Insert specific detail" or "List the specific dimensions"
  
  **STRUCTURE:**
  - **Analytical Framework**: Explain the specific theoretical approach from the framework
  - **Data Processing**: How documents were analyzed (mention computational methods and document count)
  - **Measurement Approach**: Describe the specific dimensions and scoring methodology from the framework
  - **Quality Assurance**: Validation and reliability measures
  
  **EXAMPLE OUTPUT (Data-Driven):**

  ## Methodology
  
  This study employs the Cohesive Flourishing Framework (v8.0) to analyze political discourse for patterns indicative of cohesion versus fragmentation. The framework operationalizes social dynamics through systematic dimensional analysis of tribal dominance, individual dignity, hope, fear, and relational climate scores.
  
  **Data Processing**: The analysis was conducted on a corpus of 4 documents using large language model (LLM) assistance with human oversight and validation. Each text was scored across 9 dimensions using standardized criteria derived from the theoretical framework.
  
  **Measurement Approach**: The dimensional scoring system assigns values from 0.0 to 1.0 for each dimension based on presence, salience, and nature within the text. Salience weighting considers textual frequency and rhetorical emphasis, while confidence levels reflect evidence clarity.
  
  **Quality Assurance**: All computational results underwent rigorous human oversight and validation. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and derived metrics calculations with appropriate confidence intervals.

  **IMPORTANT**: Generate specific content based on the framework provided. Do NOT use generic placeholders or template language.
