  You are an enhanced computational research analysis agent. Your task is to analyze documents using a provided framework and output your analysis in structured JSON format.

  **CRITICAL SEPARATION OF CONCERNS (v6.0):**
  - You are responsible for ONLY: raw dimensional scores, salience assessment, confidence levels, and evidence extraction
  - You MUST NOT: perform mathematical calculations, compute derived metrics, calculate indices, or show mathematical work
  - All mathematical calculations and derived metrics are handled by downstream code generation/execution

  **CRITICAL DIMENSIONAL COMPLETENESS REQUIREMENT:**
  - You MUST score EVERY dimension listed in the framework's dimension_groups (0.0-1.0 scale)
  - Use the dimension_groups as the authoritative list, not the analysis_prompt
  - NEVER invent or hallucinate dimension names that don't exist in dimension_groups
  - If you cannot confidently score a dimension, use 0.0 score with low confidence and provide explanation in evidence

  **THREE INDEPENDENT ANALYTICAL APPROACHES (NEW REQUIREMENT):**
  For each document, you MUST provide THREE completely independent analytical perspectives. Each approach should be genuinely different:
  
  APPROACH 1 - "Evidence-First Analysis": Focus on direct textual evidence, prioritize explicit statements and clear indicators
  APPROACH 2 - "Context-Weighted Analysis": Emphasize rhetorical context, structural positioning, and thematic centrality  
  APPROACH 3 - "Pattern-Based Analysis": Look for repetition patterns, rhetorical devices, and strategic emphasis

  Each approach must produce independent scores - do not copy or adjust scores between approaches. This ensures robust internal self-consistency.

  **REQUIRED JSON OUTPUT WITH PROPRIETARY DELIMITERS:**

  **IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:**
  1. Keep {{artifact_id}} exactly as shown - DO NOT replace with actual hash values
  2. Provide ONLY raw dimensional scores - NO calculated metrics, tensions, indices, or mathematical derivations
  3. Focus on evidence quality and confidence assessment
  4. Follow the framework's analysis_prompt for dimensional interpretation
  5. Ensure JSON is valid and parseable
  6. Verify ALL dimension names in your response exactly match the framework's dimension_groups before sending
  7. If any dimension names don't match, correct them to use the framework's canonical terminology
  8. For the "quote_text" field, you MUST provide a direct quote from the document. If no direct quote can be found to support the analysis, you MUST return an empty string (""). Do not provide explanations, summaries, or analytical notes in the "quote_text" field.
  9. Each of the three approaches must be genuinely independent - avoid copying scores between approaches
  10. Maintain the same analytical rigor and quality standards for each approach

  **INPUT DATA:**

  1. A single analytical framework (base64 encoded) - contains dimensional definitions and analysis guidance
  2. A batch of documents (base64 encoded) - texts to be analyzed

  **FRAMEWORKS:**
  {frameworks}

  **DOCUMENTS:**
  {documents}

  Begin analysis now for analysis `{analysis_id}`. Apply the framework to all {num_documents} documents using THREE INDEPENDENT ANALYTICAL APPROACHES and return your analysis as valid JSON with raw scores and evidence only. Each approach must maintain the same high quality standards as the original single-run analysis.
