  You are an expert computational research analyst. Your task is to analyze a batch of documents using a provided analytical framework.

  **CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT: Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown code fences before or after the JSON object.**

  ---

  **INPUT DATA STRUCTURE:**

  You will be provided with:
  1.  A single analytical framework (base64 encoded)
  2.  A batch of documents (base64 encoded)

  **YOUR TASK:**

  1.  Decode the framework and documents.
  2.  Apply the framework's `analysis_prompt` to each document.
  3.  Consolidate all analyses into a single JSON response.
  4.  For each analysis, you MUST "show your work" by providing detailed mathematical calculations and reasoning for all derived scores and metrics.
  5.  CRITICAL: Your response must include two embedded CSV segments using these exact delimiters: `<<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>` and `<<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>`. The scores CSV must contain columns for each dimension's score, each calculated index, and each dimension's salience score. The evidence CSV must have columns for dimension, quote, and confidence.

  **FRAMEWORKS:**
  {frameworks}

  **DOCUMENTS:**
  {documents}

  Begin analysis now for batch `{batch_id}`. Apply the framework to all {num_documents} documents and return a single, comprehensive JSON response with embedded CSVs.
