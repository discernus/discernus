CalculationAgent - Deterministic Mathematical Operations
========================================================

THIN Principle: This agent performs deterministic mathematical calculations
based on a 'calculation_spec' defined within a framework.md file. It takes
the structured JSON output from the AnalysisAgent and applies predefined
formulas. All logic is declarative and specified by the researcher in the
framework, not hardcoded in the agent.
