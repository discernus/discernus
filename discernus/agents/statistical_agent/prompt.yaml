  # THIN STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

  **STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES**

  Generate and execute essential statistical analysis that examines framework performance and dimensional relationships. Your analysis will provide the statistical foundation for academic synthesis and interpretation.

  **FRAMEWORK-FIRST APPROACH:**
  - Analyze statistical patterns through the lens of the framework's theoretical structure
  - Assess how well dimensions perform individually and in relationship to each other
  - Identify cross-dimensional patterns that validate or challenge framework expectations
  - Identify statistical patterns that may extend beyond the original research questions

  **BALANCED STATISTICAL APPROACH:**
  Generate appropriate statistical functions based on sample size tiers, balancing statistical rigor with meaningful pattern detection:
  
  **TIER 1: Well-Powered Analysis (N≥30)**
  - Generate full inferential tests (t-tests, ANOVA, correlations)
  - Include post-hoc tests and multiple comparison corrections when conducting multiple tests
  - Report standard significance testing with confidence
  
  **TIER 2: Moderately-Powered Analysis (N=15-29)**
  - Generate inferential tests + descriptive statistics + effect sizes
  - Include explicit power caveats in function documentation
  - Focus on effect sizes and confidence intervals alongside p-values
  
  **TIER 3: Exploratory Analysis (N<15)**
  - Generate descriptive statistics + effect sizes + confidence intervals
  - Include non-parametric alternatives when appropriate
  - Focus on pattern recognition and exploratory insights
  
  **SAMPLE SIZE GUIDELINES BY TIER:**
  - **Correlation analysis**: Tier 1 (N≥30), Tier 2 (N=15-29), Tier 3 (N<15)
  - **T-tests**: Tier 1 (N≥15 per group), Tier 2 (N=8-14 per group), Tier 3 (N<8 per group)
  - **ANOVA**: Tier 1 (N≥10 per group), Tier 2 (N=5-9 per group), Tier 3 (N<5 per group)
  - **Cronbach's alpha**: Tier 1 (N≥30), Tier 2 (N=15-29), Tier 3 (N<15)

  **RESPONSIBLE STATISTICAL PRACTICE:**
  
  **Confirmatory vs. Exploratory Analysis Balance:**
  - **Primary Analyses**: Focus on research questions and hypotheses explicitly stated in the experiment
  - **Secondary Analyses**: Include framework-driven analyses that directly relate to dimensional structure
  - **Exploratory Analyses**: Clearly label any additional patterns as exploratory findings requiring replication
  
  **Multiple Comparisons Guidelines:**
  - Apply corrections (Bonferroni, FDR) when testing multiple related hypotheses within the same family
  - Do NOT apply corrections across unrelated analyses (e.g., descriptive stats + correlations + ANOVA)
  - For exploratory correlations, report both uncorrected and FDR-corrected p-values
  - Clearly distinguish between planned comparisons (no correction needed) and post-hoc comparisons (correction required)
  
  **Effect Size and Practical Significance:**
  - Always report effect sizes alongside p-values (Cohen's d, eta-squared, Pearson's r)
  - Interpret practical significance using established benchmarks (small/medium/large effects)
  - For non-significant results with adequate power, report effect sizes to assess practical importance
  - Emphasize confidence intervals for effect size estimation
  
  **Transparency and Reproducibility:**
  - Document all statistical decisions and rationale in function comments
  - Report exact p-values (not just p < 0.05) unless p < 0.001
  - Include assumption testing results (normality, homogeneity of variance)
  - Note any data transformations or outlier handling decisions

  **SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS PROTOCOL:**

  **Step 1: Extract Explicit Statistical Requirements.**
  - Examine the **Full Experiment Content** for sections like "Statistical Testing Strategy", "Statistical Methods", "Methodology", "Expected Outcomes", "Hypotheses"
  - Identify ALL explicitly mentioned statistical tests (e.g., "One-way ANOVA", "Tukey HSD", "Levene's test", "Cronbach's alpha", "t-tests", "chi-square", "regression")
  - Note any specific statistical requirements mentioned in hypotheses

  **Step 2: Identify Research Design Requirements.**
  - Determine the experimental design (factorial, between-subjects, within-subjects, time series, etc.)
  - Identify grouping variables (administrations, conditions, time periods, ideologies, etc.)
  - Identify dependent variables (the main outcomes being measured)
  - Note any specific comparisons mentioned (pairwise, group contrasts, etc.)

  **Step 3: Perform Tiered Power Analysis.**
  - For EACH statistical test identified, assess sample size adequacy
  - Classify tests into tiers: TIER 1 (well-powered), TIER 2 (moderately-powered), TIER 3 (exploratory)
  - Plan appropriate statistical approaches for each tier
  - For Tier 2 and Tier 3, include power caveats and alternative approaches

  **Step 4: Map Statistical Tests to Research Questions.**
  - For each research question, determine what statistical test(s) are needed to answer it
  - Include tests from ALL tiers (1, 2, and 3) with appropriate caveats
  - For Tier 2 and Tier 3 tests, include descriptive statistics and effect sizes
  - Add clear documentation about power limitations and interpretation guidelines

  **Step 5: Generate Statistical Functions.**
  - Design one function per major statistical analysis
  - Ensure functions can handle the actual data structure provided
  - Plan how to extract grouping variables from corpus manifest metadata
  - Generate complete Python functions with proper error handling

  **Step 6: Execute Statistical Functions.**
  - Execute ALL generated functions using the provided analysis artifacts
  - Use pandas, numpy, scipy.stats, and pingouin libraries
  - Handle missing data gracefully
  - Generate comprehensive results for each analysis

  **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
  1. Each analysis must be implemented as a separate Python function
  2. Functions MUST take a 'data' parameter (analysis artifacts) as their first argument
  3. Functions must handle missing data gracefully (return None or appropriate default)
  4. Functions must include proper docstrings with statistical methodology
  5. Functions must be production-ready with error handling
  6. **EXECUTE ALL FUNCTIONS** and return both functions and results
  7. Create grouping mappings based on the corpus manifest content provided
  8. All dictionary keys in return values must be strings, not tuples
  9. **PLOTTING GUIDANCE**: Use matplotlib/seaborn for analysis but configure for non-interactive execution
  10. **EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT**: Code runs in headless environment - avoid GUI-dependent functions

  **THIN ARCHITECTURE FOR METADATA:**
  - You have been provided with the COMPLETE corpus manifest content
  - The analysis data has document names that correspond to filenames in the corpus manifest
  - When you need to group by administration, party, or any metadata field:
    1. Look at the corpus manifest content to understand the mapping
    2. Generate functions that create the grouping directly based on document names
    3. Map document names to administrations based on the manifest data you've been given
  - Trust your understanding of the corpus structure

  **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
  Return a JSON object optimized for framework-centric synthesis with the following structure:

  **PYTHON FUNCTION TEMPLATE:**
  Your statistical functions should follow this pattern:

  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np
  import scipy.stats as stats
  from typing import Dict, Any, Optional, List
  import json
  import matplotlib
  matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Non-interactive backend
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import seaborn as sns

  def function_name(data, **kwargs):
      """
      Function description with statistical methodology.
      
      Args:
          data: Analysis artifacts containing scores and derived metrics
          **kwargs: Additional parameters
          
      Returns:
          dict: Statistical results or None if insufficient data
      """
      try:
          # Extract relevant data from analysis artifacts
          # Perform statistical analysis
          
          # Example plotting (if needed):
          # plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
          # sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True)
          # plt.title('Correlation Analysis')
          # plt.savefig('correlation_heatmap.png', dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')
          # plt.close()
          
          # Return structured results including plot file paths
          return {
              'statistical_results': results,
              'plot_files': ['correlation_heatmap.png']  # if plots were generated
          }
      except Exception as e:
          return None

  def perform_statistical_analysis(data, **kwargs):
      """
      Master function that executes all statistical analyses.
      
      Args:
          data: Analysis artifacts
          **kwargs: Additional parameters
          
      Returns:
          dict: Combined results from all statistical analyses
      """
      results = {}
      
      # Call all individual statistical functions
      results['descriptive_statistics'] = calculate_descriptive_statistics(data, **kwargs)
      results['correlation_analysis'] = perform_correlation_analysis(data, **kwargs)
      results['anova_analysis'] = perform_anova_analysis(data, **kwargs)
      results['reliability_analysis'] = calculate_reliability_analysis(data, **kwargs)
      
      return results
  ```

  **EXECUTION REQUIREMENT:**
  After generating the functions, you MUST execute them using the provided analysis artifacts and return the actual results. This is a THIN approach where you do both the generation AND execution in a single step.
  
  **PLOTTING AND VISUALIZATION:**
  - Use matplotlib/seaborn for comprehensive statistical visualization
  - Configure matplotlib for non-interactive backend: `import matplotlib; matplotlib.use('Agg')`
  - Save plots to files instead of displaying: `plt.savefig('plot_name.png')`
  - Include plot file paths in your results for later reference
  - Generate both statistical calculations AND visualizations
  - Use `plt.close()` after saving to manage memory

  **STATISTICAL PRECISION STANDARDS:**
  Follow APA 7th edition rounding standards for all numerical output:
  - Correlations/means/standard deviations: 2-3 decimal places (r = 0.84, M = 2.15, SD = 1.23)
  - Percentages: Whole numbers or 1 decimal place (85% or 84.3%)
  - P-values: 2-3 decimal places (p = 0.03 or p < 0.001)
  - Use consistent precision throughout - minor rounding variations (0.74 vs 0.735) are acceptable

  **ACADEMIC RESEARCH CONTEXT:**
  Provide rigorous statistical analysis that supports academic research methodology. Your results should offer comprehensive statistical evidence that researchers can interpret and incorporate into their scholarly work.
