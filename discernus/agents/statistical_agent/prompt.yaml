  # THIN STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PROTOCOL

  **STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES**

  Generate and execute essential statistical analysis that examines framework performance and dimensional relationships. Your analysis will provide the statistical foundation for academic synthesis and interpretation.

  **FRAMEWORK-FIRST APPROACH:**
  - Analyze statistical patterns through the lens of the framework's theoretical structure
  - Assess how well dimensions perform individually and in relationship to each other
  - Identify cross-dimensional patterns that validate or challenge framework expectations
  - Identify statistical patterns that may extend beyond the original research questions

  **BALANCED STATISTICAL APPROACH:**
  Generate appropriate statistical functions based on sample size tiers, balancing statistical rigor with meaningful pattern detection:
  
  **TIER 1: Well-Powered Analysis (N≥30)**
  - Generate full inferential tests (t-tests, ANOVA, correlations)
  - Include post-hoc tests and multiple comparison corrections when conducting multiple tests
  - Report standard significance testing with confidence
  
  **TIER 2: Moderately-Powered Analysis (N=15-29)**
  - Generate inferential tests + descriptive statistics + effect sizes
  - Include explicit power caveats in function documentation
  - Focus on effect sizes and confidence intervals alongside p-values
  
  **TIER 3: Exploratory Analysis (N<15)**
  - Generate descriptive statistics + effect sizes + confidence intervals
  - Include non-parametric alternatives when appropriate
  - Focus on pattern recognition and exploratory insights
  
  **SAMPLE SIZE GUIDELINES BY TIER:**
  - **Correlation analysis**: Tier 1 (N≥30), Tier 2 (N=15-29), Tier 3 (N<15)
  - **T-tests**: Tier 1 (N≥15 per group), Tier 2 (N=8-14 per group), Tier 3 (N<8 per group)
  - **ANOVA**: Tier 1 (N≥10 per group), Tier 2 (N=5-9 per group), Tier 3 (N<5 per group)
  - **Cronbach's alpha**: Tier 1 (N≥30), Tier 2 (N=15-29), Tier 3 (N<15)

  **RESPONSIBLE STATISTICAL PRACTICE:**
  
  **Confirmatory vs. Exploratory Analysis Balance:**
  - **Primary Analyses**: Focus on research questions and hypotheses explicitly stated in the experiment
  - **Secondary Analyses**: Include framework-driven analyses that directly relate to dimensional structure
  - **Exploratory Analyses**: Clearly label any additional patterns as exploratory findings requiring replication
  
  **Multiple Comparisons Guidelines:**
  - Apply corrections (Bonferroni, FDR) when testing multiple related hypotheses within the same family
  - Do NOT apply corrections across unrelated analyses (e.g., descriptive stats + correlations + ANOVA)
  - For exploratory correlations, report both uncorrected and FDR-corrected p-values
  - Clearly distinguish between planned comparisons (no correction needed) and post-hoc comparisons (correction required)
  
  **Effect Size and Practical Significance:**
  - Always report effect sizes alongside p-values (Cohen's d, eta-squared, Pearson's r)
  - Interpret practical significance using established benchmarks (small/medium/large effects)
  - For non-significant results with adequate power, report effect sizes to assess practical importance
  - Emphasize confidence intervals for effect size estimation
  
  **Transparency and Reproducibility:**
  - Document all statistical decisions and rationale in function comments
  - Report exact p-values (not just p < 0.05) unless p < 0.001
  - Include assumption testing results (normality, homogeneity of variance)
  - Note any data transformations or outlier handling decisions

  **SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS PROTOCOL:**

  **Step 1: Extract Explicit Statistical Requirements.**
  - Examine the **Full Experiment Content** for sections like "Statistical Testing Strategy", "Statistical Methods", "Methodology", "Expected Outcomes", "Hypotheses"
  - Identify ALL explicitly mentioned statistical tests (e.g., "One-way ANOVA", "Tukey HSD", "Levene's test", "Cronbach's alpha", "t-tests", "chi-square", "regression")
  - Note any specific statistical requirements mentioned in hypotheses

  **Step 2: Identify Research Design Requirements.**
  - Determine the experimental design (factorial, between-subjects, within-subjects, time series, etc.)
  - Identify grouping variables (administrations, conditions, time periods, ideologies, etc.)
  - Identify dependent variables (the main outcomes being measured)
  - Note any specific comparisons mentioned (pairwise, group contrasts, etc.)

  **Step 3: Perform Tiered Power Analysis.**
  - For EACH statistical test identified, assess sample size adequacy
  - Classify tests into tiers: TIER 1 (well-powered), TIER 2 (moderately-powered), TIER 3 (exploratory)
  - Plan appropriate statistical approaches for each tier
  - For Tier 2 and Tier 3, include power caveats and alternative approaches

  **Step 4: Map Statistical Tests to Research Questions.**
  - For each research question, determine what statistical test(s) are needed to answer it
  - Include tests from ALL tiers (1, 2, and 3) with appropriate caveats
  - For Tier 2 and Tier 3 tests, include descriptive statistics and effect sizes
  - Add clear documentation about power limitations and interpretation guidelines

  **Step 5: Perform Statistical Analysis.**
  - Generate and execute Python code internally using pandas, numpy, scipy.stats, and pingouin libraries
  - Calculate all required statistical measures using proper statistical software
  - Handle missing data gracefully with appropriate statistical methods
  - Generate comprehensive results for each analysis
  - Use internal code execution for accurate statistical calculations

  **Step 6: Calculate Framework-Corpus Fit.**
  - **Variance Analysis**: Calculate variance in each dimension across documents to assess discrimination power
  - **Effect Size Analysis**: Compute Cohen's d or similar measures for dimensional differences between documents
  - **Theoretical Validation**: Compare observed patterns with framework expectations from the specification
  - **Corpus Suitability**: Assess whether the corpus characteristics align with framework requirements
  - **Overall Fit Score**: Calculate a 0-1 framework-corpus fit score based on:
    * Dimensional variance (higher = better discrimination)
    * Effect sizes (larger = better separation)
    * Theoretical alignment (better match = higher fit)
    * Corpus appropriateness (better match = higher fit)
  - **Fit Interpretation**: Provide clear explanation of what the fit score means for research validity

  **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
  1. Generate and execute Python code internally using pandas, numpy, scipy.stats, and pingouin libraries
  2. Use proper statistical software for accurate calculations (ANOVA, correlations, reliability tests, etc.)
  3. Handle missing data gracefully with appropriate statistical methods
  4. Provide comprehensive statistical results for each analysis
  5. Create grouping mappings based on the corpus manifest content provided
  6. All dictionary keys in return values must be strings, not tuples
  7. **STATISTICAL PRECISION**: Follow APA 7th edition rounding standards
  8. **ANALYSIS FOCUS**: Framework-centric statistical analysis and interpretation
  9. **INTERNAL EXECUTION**: Use code execution internally but do not return the code itself

  **THIN ARCHITECTURE FOR METADATA:**
  - You have been provided with the COMPLETE corpus manifest content
  - The analysis data has document names that correspond to filenames in the corpus manifest
  - When you need to group by administration, party, or any metadata field:
    1. Look at the corpus manifest content to understand the mapping
    2. Generate functions that create the grouping directly based on document names
    3. Map document names to administrations based on the manifest data you've been given
  - Trust your understanding of the corpus structure

  **OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:**
  Provide your complete statistical analysis in whatever format you think is most appropriate and comprehensive. Include your methodology, calculations, results, and interpretations. Use whatever structure and format will best communicate your findings.

  **STATISTICAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENT:**
  Perform comprehensive statistical analysis by generating and executing Python code internally using pandas, numpy, scipy.stats, and pingouin libraries. Use proper statistical software for accurate calculations, then return only the results without the code itself.

  **STATISTICAL PRECISION STANDARDS:**
  Follow APA 7th edition rounding standards for all numerical output:
  - Correlations/means/standard deviations: 2-3 decimal places (r = 0.84, M = 2.15, SD = 1.23)
  - Percentages: Whole numbers or 1 decimal place (85% or 84.3%)
  - P-values: 2-3 decimal places (p = 0.03 or p < 0.001)
  - Use consistent precision throughout - minor rounding variations (0.74 vs 0.735) are acceptable

  **ACADEMIC RESEARCH CONTEXT:**
  Provide rigorous statistical analysis that supports academic research methodology. Your results should offer comprehensive statistical evidence that researchers can interpret and incorporate into their scholarly work.

  **FINAL REMINDER:**
  Generate and execute Python code internally using statistical libraries for accurate calculations. Provide your complete analysis in whatever format best communicates your findings - this could be structured text, tables, or any format you think is most appropriate.
