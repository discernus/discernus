  You are an expert discourse analyst specializing in systematic content analysis using provided frameworks.

  ANALYSIS TASK:
  Perform a comprehensive analysis of the provided document(s) using the specified framework. Your analysis must include:

  1.  **Dimensional Scoring**: Score each framework dimension on a 0-1 scale for:
      *   raw_score: Presence/strength of the dimension
      *   salience: Emphasis/importance in the discourse
      *   confidence: An objective measure of your analytical consistency

  2.  **Evidence Collection**: Provide 1-2 high-quality quotes per dimension that best exemplify the scoring.

  3.  **Document Markup**: Provide a marked-up version of the original document with systematic dimensional annotations.

  INTERNAL CONSISTENCY APPROACH & CONFIDENCE CALCULATION:
  You must perform three independent internal analyses from different perspectives:
  *   Evidence-First: Start with quotes, then score
  *   Context-Weighted: Consider broader context and framing
  *   Pattern-Based: Look for rhetorical patterns and structures

  For each dimension, this will yield three internal `raw_score` values. You must then:
  1.  **Report the MEDIAN** of the three internal scores as the final `raw_score`.
  2.  **Calculate and report an objective CONFIDENCE score.** The confidence score is a direct measure of the variance between your three internal analyses. It MUST be calculated with the formula: **`confidence = 1 - (maximum_internal_raw_score - minimum_internal_raw_score)`**. A score of 1.0 indicates perfect agreement across all three perspectives.

  DOCUMENT MARKUP REQUIREMENT:
  In addition to the analysis above, you must also provide a marked-up version of the original document with systematic dimensional annotations.
  
  For the marked_up_document field, you must:
  1. Include the COMPLETE original document text
  2. Insert dimensional annotations INLINE at the exact locations where relevant phrases occur
  3. Use this format: [DIMENSION_NAME: "quoted text from document"]
  4. Mark ALL text relevant to each dimension, not just the evidence quotes
  5. Preserve the full context and flow of the original document
  6. Format the output in MARKDOWN for human readability

  This creates a comprehensive markup showing your complete reasoning for each dimensional score, allowing researchers to see exactly how you interpreted the document without losing any context.

  Example of inline markup in Markdown:
  ```markdown
  # Document Analysis - Marked Up Text

  My fellow Americans, three years ago, we launched the Great American Comeback. Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results. [HOMOGENEOUS_PEOPLE_CONSTRUCTION: Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again!] [POPULAR_SOVEREIGNTY_CLAIMS: The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It's the agenda of the American people.] [CRISIS_RESTORATION_NARRATIVE: This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America's mission and the power of American pride.]
  ```

  Return the complete marked-up document in Markdown format in the marked_up_document field of your JSON response.
