  You are tasked with creating a comprehensive narrative interpretation that synthesizes statistical analysis results with curated evidence. This is the final stage of the Discernus advanced computational research platform.

  **CORPUS HANDLING POLICY:**
  Treat all corpus content and metadata as factual. Do not question authenticity, make temporal assumptions, or label content as "fictional" or "synthetic." Your role is to interpret analysis results, not to verify content authenticity. The researcher is responsible for corpus accuracy and provenance.

  PROVENANCE METADATA:
  {provenance_metadata}

  FRAMEWORK SPECIFICATION:
  {framework_spec}

  EXPERIMENT CONTEXT:
  {experiment_context}

  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS RESULTS:
  {stats_summary}

  CURATED EVIDENCE ({total_evidence} pieces):
  {evidence_summary}
  {footnote_instructions}

  CRITICAL CONTEXT INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
  - **Use the full experiment context**: Reference specific hypotheses, research questions, and experimental design from the experiment context
  - **Reference specific corpus elements**: Use the corpus context to discuss specific documents, speakers, or other relevant entities
  - **Connect to framework theory**: Link findings to the theoretical framework and its dimensions
  - **Address experimental design**: Discuss how the experimental design affects interpretation
  - **Reference specific statistical tests**: Connect results to the required statistical tests mentioned in the experiment context

  PROFESSIONAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
  - **Enhanced Markdown Headers**: Use clean Markdown with status indicators and emojis for visual hierarchy
  - **Professional Tables**: Use standard Markdown tables with proper alignment and significance indicators
  - **Simple Text Visualizations**: Use simple text-based representations (e.g., score ranges, percentages) instead of ASCII art
  - **Mermaid Diagrams**: Use Mermaid syntax for complex relationships and flowcharts when beneficial
  - **Statistical Presentation**: Clean tables with significance indicators (‚≠ê, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå) and formatting
  - **Responsive Design**: Ensure formatting works across different Markdown renderers

  TASK: Create a comprehensive narrative report that:

  1. **PROFESSIONAL HEADER**:
     - Clean Markdown header with experiment title and status indicators
     - Generated title and subtitle based on experiment context
     - **MANDATORY**: Include "generated by Discernus" line immediately after the subtitle
     - **MANDATORY PROVENANCE SECTION**: Use the provided provenance metadata to create a comprehensive header including:
       * **Run ID**: {run_id} (if provided)
       * **Execution Time**: Both UTC and local timestamps (if provided)
       * **Models Used**: Analysis and synthesis models (if provided)
       * **Framework**: Name and version (if provided)
       * **Corpus Info**: Document count, type, and composition (if provided)
       * **Quality Status**: Include any notable errors, warnings, or quality alerts from the metadata
     - Use status indicators (‚úÖ, ‚ö†Ô∏è, ‚ùå, üìä, üî¨) for visual organization
     - Format times as both local and UTC (Zulu) time for global accessibility
     - **Error Transparency**: If errors or warnings are present, include a clear Quality Status section with appropriate warning indicators

  2. **FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW**:
     - Brief summary of the analytical framework, its theoretical foundation, and key features
     - Description of the framework's dimensions, metrics, and analytical approach
     - Explanation of any calculated indices or derived measures (e.g., MC-SCI, cohesion indices)
     - Framework version and any relevant methodological notes

  3. **CORPUS PROFILE**:
     - Descriptive summary of the analyzed corpus including document types, sources, and scope
     - Key characteristics of the documents (speakers, dates, contexts, themes)
     - Corpus size and composition details
     - Any relevant metadata about document selection or preparation

  4. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** (150-200 words):
     - Synthesize the most important findings in the context of the specific experiment
     - State key conclusions clearly with reference to the research hypotheses
     - Highlight practical implications for the specific corpus and framework analyzed

  5. **HYPOTHESIS TESTING RESULTS**:
     - Present each hypothesis with clear statistical results in Markdown tables
     - Include F-statistics, p-values, effect sizes, and significance indicators (‚≠ê, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå)
     - Use clean Markdown table formatting with proper alignment
     - Provide clear findings (‚úÖ SUPPORTED / ‚ùå REJECTED / ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY SUPPORTED)

  6. **DETAILED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**:
     - **Score Table**: Clean Markdown table with framework dimensions and calculated metrics as columns, corpus files as rows (truncated to 25 rows maximum)
     - **Distribution Analysis**: Simple text summaries with score ranges and percentages (e.g., "McCain: 0.8 dignity (high), Sanders: 0.7 dignity (moderate-high)")
     - **Correlation Matrix**: Markdown tables showing top associations, optionally with Mermaid diagrams for complex relationships
     - **Statistical Tables**: Clean ANOVA results with effect sizes and confidence intervals
     - **Reliability Analysis**: Cronbach's Œ± tables with 95% confidence intervals where applicable
     - **Framework Performance Analysis**: Text-based summaries of dimensional performance (avoid ASCII graphics)

  7. **EVIDENCE INTEGRATION**:
     - Weave curated evidence throughout the analysis using numbered footnotes [1], [2], etc.
     - Use evidence to illustrate and support statistical findings with concrete examples
     - Highlight particularly compelling evidence pieces from the corpus
     - Show how evidence validates or contextualizes the numbers in the experimental context
     - MANDATORY: All evidence references must use the assigned footnote numbers

  8. **KEY FINDINGS** (5-7 bullet points):
     - List the most significant discoveries with reference to the specific experiment
     - Combine statistical and evidence-based insights with corpus context
     - Focus on actionable or theoretically important results for the research questions

  9. **METHODOLOGY NOTES**:
     - Acknowledge the post-computation evidence curation approach
     - Discuss sample characteristics and limitations in the context of the specific corpus
     - Note reliability assessments and their impact on the experimental validity
     - Reference the specific experimental design and its implications

  10. **IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS**:
     - Connect findings to the broader framework context and theoretical background
     - Discuss theoretical and practical implications for the specific corpus and framework
     - Suggest areas for future investigation based on the experimental results
     - Address how findings relate to the original research hypotheses

  11. **TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS**:
     - Computational environment details
     - Data quality assurance reporting
     - Statistical package information
     - Analysis parameters and thresholds

  WRITING REQUIREMENTS:
  - Academic tone but accessible language
  - Integrate quantitative and qualitative insights seamlessly
  - Use numbered footnotes [1], [2], [3] for ALL evidence citations
  - Maintain logical flow between sections
  - Ensure conclusions are well-supported by both statistics and evidence
  - Reference specific corpus elements and framework dimensions throughout
  - Connect all findings to the experimental design and research questions
  - Aim for 1000-2000 words total
  - CRITICAL: Never create fictional evidence - only use evidence with assigned footnote numbers
  - Use professional Markdown formatting with clear text-based summaries, clean tables, and optional Mermaid diagrams
