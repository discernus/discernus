  Generate a comprehensive research report based on statistical analysis and experimental data. The report should follow academic standards with neutral, factual language and rigorous analytical methodology.
  
  The analysis should provide systematic insights derived from computational methods, presenting findings that support evidence-based conclusions suitable for academic discourse.

  # STAGE 1 TASK: FRAMEWORK-DRIVEN DATA ANALYSIS
  
  Generate a comprehensive research report based SOLELY on statistical results and experiment metadata. The analysis must demonstrate deep understanding of the framework's intellectual architecture and reveal systematic insights derived from the data.

  ## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS
  - NO evidence quotes or corpus text should influence your analysis
  - ALL analytical claims must be anchored in the statistical data provided
  - This is Stage 1 of a two-stage process - evidence integration comes later
  - Focus on what the DATA reveals about the framework's performance and insights

  ## SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS PROTOCOL
  
  **IMPORTANT**: You MUST perform the following steps in order, using the output of each step to inform the next. Do not synthesize the final report until you have completed all internal analytical steps.

  **Step 1: Deconstruct the Framework Architecture**
  - Examine the **Framework Specification** provided below
  - Internally identify its core purpose, its primary dimensions, any derived metrics (if defined), and what makes it novel or important
  - Consider how the framework's structure should manifest in statistical patterns

  **Step 2: Identify Key Statistical Patterns**
  - Examine the **Complete Statistical Results** from the statistical agent
  - In light of the framework's structure from Step 1, identify the most significant statistical findings
  - Focus on the strongest correlations (both positive and negative, prioritizing salience scores if available), most significant differences, and most revealing patterns
  - **Prioritize `statistical_results`**: Base ALL your analytical claims, interpretations, and insights on the numerical data in `statistical_results`. This is your primary source of truth.

  **Step 3: Evaluate Experimental Hypotheses**
  - Review the **Experiment Configuration** and corpus context
  - Determine if this is hypothesis-driven research or exploratory analysis
  - Identify explicit and implicit research questions
  - Evaluate how the statistical findings from Step 2 confirm or falsify the experiment's hypotheses
  - **CRITICAL**: These evaluations will be used to populate the final report. Do NOT include Step 3 content as intermediate artifacts - integrate it properly into the academic report structure.

  **Step 4: Construct the Core Narrative**
  - Based on the insights from Steps 1-3, formulate a central thesis or narrative for the research report
  - What is the single most important story the data is telling about the framework's performance?

  **Step 5: Synthesize the Final Report**
  - **ONLY AFTER** completing steps 1-4, write the full academic report
  - Use the narrative from Step 4 as the foundation for the Executive Summary and Key Insights
  - Systematically present the findings, integrating the statistical results with framework interpretation
  - Follow the required academic report structure (Executive Summary, Key Insights, Methodology, etc.)

  ## REPORT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

  ### 0. Experiment Provenance Header (REQUIRED FIRST)
  Start every report with available experiment metadata:

  ```

  ## ANALYTICAL DEPTH REQUIREMENTS

  ### Statistical Interpretation Standards - Tiered Approach
  - **TIER 1: Well-Powered Results (N≥30)**
    * Interpret standard significance testing with confidence
    * Report: "Significant difference found" or "No significant difference"
    * Include effect sizes and confidence intervals for context
  
  - **TIER 2: Moderately-Powered Results (N=15-29)**
    * Include inferential tests with explicit power caveats
    * Report: "Significant difference found (N=X, interpret with caution)" or "Insufficient power to detect effects"
    * Emphasize effect sizes and confidence intervals alongside p-values
    * State: "Due to moderate sample size (N=X), these findings should be interpreted with caution"
  
  - **TIER 3: Exploratory Results (N<15)**
    * Focus on descriptive statistics, effect sizes, and pattern recognition
    * Report: "Suggestive pattern (N=X, exploratory analysis)" or "No clear pattern detected"
    * State: "Due to limited sample size (N=X), these findings are exploratory and suggestive rather than conclusive"
    * Use non-parametric alternatives when appropriate
  - **No calculations**: Interpret provided statistics as definitive facts
  - **APA Numerical Precision**: Follow APA 7th edition rounding standards:
    * Round correlations, means, and standard deviations to 2-3 decimal places (e.g., r = 0.84, M = 2.15)
    * Round percentages to whole numbers or 1 decimal place (e.g., 85% or 84.3%)
    * Round p-values to 2-3 decimal places (e.g., p = 0.03 or p < 0.001)
    * Use consistent precision throughout the report - don't mix 0.74 and 0.735 for the same metric
  - **Acceptable Rounding Variations**: Minor precision differences (0.74 vs 0.735) are acceptable and should not be flagged as errors
  - **Data Interpretation Process**: Use the exact numerical values from the statistical data to inform your qualitative descriptions and determine effect sizes
  - **Transparency**: State analytical approach clearly (descriptive vs. inferential)  
  - **Appropriate conclusions**: Draw strongest evidence-based conclusions possible while avoiding grandiose or unsubstantiated claims
  - **Uncertainty acknowledgment**: Note limitations while maximizing insights
  - **Academic Tone**: Use measured, evidence-based language rather than superlatives or overstated claims

  ### Framework-Centric Analysis
  - **Theoretical Grounding**: Connect statistical patterns to framework's intellectual foundations
  - **Dimensional Sophistication**: Analyze each dimension's performance and cross-relationships
  - **Validation Assessment**: Evaluate whether the framework behaves as theorized
  - **Extension Opportunities**: Identify where the framework could be enhanced or applied differently

  ### Framework Agnosticism Standards
  - **Dynamic adaptation**: Work with any framework's dimensional structure
  - **No assumptions**: Don't assume specific dimension names or relationships
  - **Flexible analysis**: Adapt analytical depth to available data richness
  - **Universal patterns**: Look for insights applicable across frameworks
  - **Accurate terminology**: Use the exact framework terminology from the specification (e.g., if framework calls them "axes" don't call them "dimensions")
  - **Structure fidelity**: Describe framework structure exactly as defined (e.g., "Identity Axis: Tribalism/Dignity" not "Identity dimension")
  - **Avoid hallucination**: Never invent framework elements not present in the specification

  ### Insight Generation Principles
  - **Beyond Confirmation**: Look for patterns that extend beyond hypothesis testing
  - **Framework Innovation**: Consider how findings might refine or advance the framework
  - **Emergent Patterns**: Identify insights that extend beyond stated objectives
  - **Field Advancement**: Assess broader implications for computational social science

  ### Academic Quality Standards
  - **Publication-ready**: Suitable for peer-reviewed journal submission
  - **Methodological rigor**: Clear methodology and limitation acknowledgment
  - **Theoretical grounding**: Connect to relevant academic literature when possible
  - **Reproducible insights**: Clear connection from data through analysis to conclusions
  - **Cautious Tone & Claim Strength**: Maintain a neutral, objective, and academic tone. Avoid promotional language, superlatives, and grandiose claims (e.g., "powerful," "profound," "demonstrates conclusively," "validates the framework"). All claims must be proportional to the evidence. Given the small sample size of this pilot study (N=4), all findings should be presented as "preliminary," "suggestive," or "indicative" rather than "validated" or "proven." State findings factually and let the data speak for itself.

  ## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
  
  **Analytical Rigor**: Sophisticated analysis that reveals systematic insights through computational methods
  **Academic Standards**: Professional quality suitable for academic discourse and peer review
  **Empirical Foundation**: Position findings as data-driven discoveries that support evidence-based conclusions
  **Framework Assessment**: Reveal the framework's performance and potential through systematic evaluation

  **Target Length**: 3000-5000 words for comprehensive analysis
  **Tone**: Neutral, factual, and academic following established scholarly conventions
  **Statistical Precision**: Follow APA 7th edition rounding standards - correlations/means/SDs to 2-3 decimal places (r = 0.84, M = 2.15), percentages to whole numbers or 1 decimal (85% or 84.3%), p-values to 2-3 decimals (p = 0.03 or p < 0.001). Use consistent precision throughout - minor rounding variations (0.74 vs 0.735) are acceptable

  ## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

  **CRITICAL REPORT REQUIREMENTS**:
  - **Hypothesis Evaluation**: If the experiment contains hypotheses, Section 5.1 MUST be included and MUST address ALL hypotheses in sequence with CONFIRMED/FALSIFIED/INDETERMINATE outcomes
  - **No Intermediate Artifacts**: Do NOT include internal processing steps (Step 1-4) in the final report - integrate insights into proper academic sections
  - **Sequential Hypothesis Format**: Use format like "H₁ (Description): CONFIRMED. [Evidence and explanation]"

  **Target Length**: 3000-5000 words for comprehensive analysis
  **Writing Style**: Academic but accessible, suitable for computational social science journals
  **Evidence Integration**: Seamless weaving of statistical evidence throughout

  This is Stage 1 - pure data-driven analysis that reveals the framework's performance and potential through systematic statistical evaluation. Evidence integration occurs in Stage 2.
