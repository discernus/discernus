  Generate a comprehensive research report based on statistical analysis and experimental data. The report should follow academic standards with neutral, factual language and rigorous analytical methodology.
  
  The analysis should provide systematic insights derived from computational methods, presenting findings that support evidence-based conclusions suitable for academic discourse.

  # STAGE 1 TASK: FRAMEWORK-DRIVEN DATA ANALYSIS
  
  Generate a comprehensive research report based SOLELY on statistical results and experiment metadata. The analysis must demonstrate deep understanding of the framework's intellectual architecture and reveal systematic insights derived from the data.

  ## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS
  - NO evidence quotes or corpus text should influence your analysis
  - ALL analytical claims must be anchored in the statistical data provided
  - This is Stage 1 of a two-stage process - evidence integration comes later
  - Focus on what the DATA reveals about the framework's performance and insights

  ## SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS PROTOCOL
  
  **IMPORTANT**: You MUST perform these steps in order, using each to inform the next:

  **Step 1: Deconstruct the Framework Architecture**
  - Examine the framework specification to understand its intellectual purpose
  - Identify its core dimensions, any derived metrics (if defined), and theoretical foundations
  - Assess what makes this framework novel or important for the field
  - Consider how the framework's structure should manifest in statistical patterns

  **Step 2: Analyze Statistical Agent Output**
  - The statistical analysis artifact contains two key parts: `execution_results` and `statistical_functions`.
  - **Prioritize `execution_results`**: Base ALL your analytical claims, interpretations, and insights on the numerical data in `execution_results`. This is your primary source of truth.
  - **Analyze `statistical_functions` for Methodology**: Examine the Python code in `statistical_functions` to understand the specific tests, parameters, and scientific approach used. This provides the methodological context for the results.
  - **Generate a Methodological Summary**: Based on your analysis of the code, write a concise, academic-style summary of the statistical methods implemented. This summary will be used in the final report.

  **Step 3: Analyze Experimental Intent**
  - Analyze the experiment configuration and corpus context
  - Determine if this is hypothesis-driven research or exploratory analysis
  - Identify explicit and implicit research questions
  - Consider intended objectives versus actual findings

  **Step 4: Interpret Statistical Patterns Through Framework Lens**
  - Examine statistical results in light of the framework's theoretical structure
  - Identify the strongest correlations, most significant differences, and revealing patterns
  - Look for framework validation (do dimensions behave as theorized?)
  - Detect unexpected patterns that challenge or extend the framework

  **Step 5: Identify Emergent Insights**
  - Look beyond stated experimental objectives
  - Identify statistical patterns that reveal unexplored framework capabilities
  - Consider cross-dimensional relationships that extend beyond initial hypotheses
  - Assess whether the framework captured phenomena beyond its intended scope

  **Step 6: Synthesize Framework Performance Assessment**
  - Evaluate how well the framework performed in this analytical context
  - Identify framework strengths, limitations, and unexpected capabilities
  - Consider implications for framework refinement or broader application

  ## REPORT STRUCTURE

  ### 1. Executive Summary (2-3 paragraphs)
  - Central thesis: What is the single most important story the data tells?
  - Key statistical findings that validate or challenge the framework
  - Primary insights with their significance for the research question
  - Framework effectiveness assessment

  ### 2. Framework Analysis & Performance
  - **Framework Architecture**: Core purpose, dimensions, and theoretical foundations
  - **Statistical Validation**: How well do the data patterns match framework expectations?
  - **Dimensional Effectiveness**: Which dimensions performed strongest/weakest and why
  - **Cross-Dimensional Insights**: Unexpected relationships between framework elements

  ### 3. Experimental Intent & Hypothesis Evaluation
  - **Research Question Assessment**: Stated experimental objectives and research questions
  - **Hypothesis Outcomes** (if present): CONFIRMED/FALSIFIED/INDETERMINATE with statistical evidence
  - **Exploratory Findings** (if no hypotheses): Primary patterns discovered through analysis
  - **Intent vs. Discovery**: Findings that extend beyond stated objectives

  ### 4. Statistical Findings & Patterns
  - **Primary Results**: Strongest statistical patterns with framework interpretation
  - **Dimensional Analysis**: Performance of each framework dimension with cross-comparisons
  - **Correlation Networks**: Relationships between dimensions and any derived metrics (if available)
  - **Anomalies & Surprises**: Unexpected results that challenge assumptions

  ### 5. Emergent Insights & Framework Extensions
  - **Beyond the Research Question**: Insights that extend beyond stated objectives
  - **Framework Potential**: Capabilities revealed that weren't explicitly explored
  - **Methodological Discoveries**: What this analysis reveals about the framework's broader utility
  - **Theoretical Implications**: How findings extend or challenge the framework's foundations

  ### 6. Limitations & Methodological Assessment
  - **Statistical Power**: Sample size considerations and confidence levels
  - **Framework Limitations**: Where the framework may have missed important phenomena
  - **Analytical Constraints**: Boundaries of what can be concluded from this data
  - **Future Research Directions**: What should be explored next

  ### 7. Research Implications & Significance
  - **Field Contributions**: How these findings advance the research domain
  - **Framework Development**: Implications for refining or extending the framework
  - **Methodological Insights**: What this reveals about computational social science approaches
  - **Broader Applications**: Where else this framework might be valuable

  ### 8. Methodological Summary
  - A concise, academic-style summary of the statistical methods implemented, derived from the statistical agent's code.
  - This section should describe the specific tests, parameters, and analytical approaches used.

  ## ANALYTICAL DEPTH REQUIREMENTS

  ### Statistical Interpretation Standards
  - **Well-Powered Results (Nâ‰¥30)**: Full inferential interpretation with confidence
  - **Moderate Power (N=15-29)**: Cautious interpretation with explicit power limitations
  - **Exploratory Results (N<15)**: Descriptive focus with suggestive pattern identification
  - **No LLM Math**: Interpret provided statistics as definitive - never calculate

  ### Framework-Centric Analysis
  - **Theoretical Grounding**: Connect statistical patterns to framework's intellectual foundations
  - **Dimensional Sophistication**: Analyze each dimension's performance and cross-relationships
  - **Validation Assessment**: Evaluate whether the framework behaves as theorized
  - **Extension Opportunities**: Identify where the framework could be enhanced or applied differently

  ### Insight Generation Principles
  - **Beyond Confirmation**: Look for patterns that extend beyond hypothesis testing
  - **Framework Innovation**: Consider how findings might refine or advance the framework
  - **Emergent Patterns**: Identify insights that extend beyond stated objectives
  - **Field Advancement**: Assess broader implications for computational social science

  ## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
  
  **Analytical Rigor**: Sophisticated analysis that reveals systematic insights through computational methods
  **Academic Standards**: Professional quality suitable for academic discourse and peer review
  **Empirical Foundation**: Position findings as data-driven discoveries that support evidence-based conclusions
  **Framework Assessment**: Reveal the framework's performance and potential through systematic evaluation

  **Target Length**: 2500-4000 words for comprehensive analysis
  **Tone**: Neutral, factual, and academic following established scholarly conventions
  **Statistical Precision**: Follow APA 7th edition rounding standards - correlations/means/SDs to 2-3 decimal places (r = 0.84, M = 2.15), percentages to whole numbers or 1 decimal (85% or 84.3%), p-values to 2-3 decimals (p = 0.03 or p < 0.001). Use consistent precision throughout - minor rounding variations (0.74 vs 0.735) are acceptable

  This is Stage 1 - pure data-driven analysis that reveals the framework's performance and potential through systematic statistical evaluation. Evidence integration occurs in Stage 2.
