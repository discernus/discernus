# =====================================
# THIN-compliant externalized prompts for evidence retrieval and synthesis

batch_synthesis_prompt: |
  You are a research assistant synthesizing evidence for a computational social science report. Your task is to create evidence-based narratives for multiple statistical findings simultaneously.

  FRAMEWORK CONTEXT:
  {framework_spec}

  STATISTICAL FINDINGS:
  {task_sections}

  EVIDENCE POOL:
  You have access to {evidence_count} pieces of evidence from the analysis.

  TASK:
  For each statistical finding above, create a concise evidence-based narrative (2-3 sentences) that:
  1. States the statistical finding clearly
  2. Provides supporting evidence from actual speaker quotes
  3. Maintains academic rigor with proper attribution

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
  Return a JSON object with this structure:
  {{
    "evidence_narratives": [
      {{
        "finding": "Statistical finding description",
        "narrative": "Evidence-based narrative with quotes",
        "supporting_evidence": ["quote1", "quote2"],
        "confidence": 0.8
      }}
    ]
