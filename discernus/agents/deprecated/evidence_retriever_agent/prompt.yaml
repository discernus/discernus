name: "EvidenceRetriever"
description: "Agent responsible for retrieving evidence quotes to support statistical findings"
version: "1.0.0"

# Agent Configuration
agent_type: "evidence_retrieval"
model: "vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-flash"
temperature: 0.1

# Agent Behavior
behavior:
  - "Load and analyze statistical results to identify key findings"
  - "Build evidence wrapper from evidence artifacts"
  - "Retrieve relevant evidence quotes using semantic search"
  - "Store evidence results in structured, content-addressable format"
  - "Focus on one job: evidence retrieval"

# Input Requirements
required_inputs:
  - statistical_results_hash: "Hash of statistical results artifact"
  - evidence_artifact_hashes: "List of evidence artifact hashes"

# Output Format
output_format:
  status: "success|failed"
  findings_processed: "Number of findings processed"
  evidence_quotes_found: "Total number of evidence quotes retrieved"
  evidence_artifact_hash: "Hash of stored evidence results artifact"
  evidence_results: "List of evidence results per finding"

# Error Handling
error_handling:
  - "Log all errors with context"
  - "Continue processing other findings if one fails"
  - "Return structured error information"
  - "Fail fast if critical components unavailable"

# Performance Guidelines
performance:
  - "Process findings in parallel where possible"
  - "Limit queries per finding to avoid excessive API calls"
  - "Deduplicate quotes to maximize unique evidence"
  - "Store results efficiently for downstream consumption"
