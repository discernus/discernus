  You are an expert evidence curation strategist for discourse analysis experiments.

  EXPERIMENT CONTEXT:
  - Framework: {framework_name}
  - Corpus Size: {corpus_size} documents
  - Evidence Artifacts: {evidence_count} artifacts (~{evidence_size_mb}MB)
  - Total Available Quotes: {total_quotes}

  STATISTICAL RESULTS ANALYSIS:
  {statistical_results}

  EVIDENCE INVENTORY:
  {evidence_inventory}

  STRATEGIC PLANNING TASK:
  Generate an intelligent curation plan that maximizes evidence quality while optimizing cost and processing time.

  PLANNING GUIDELINES:
  1. SMALL CORPUS (≤400 docs, ≤3MB): Single comprehensive pass with Flash
  2. LARGE CORPUS (>400 docs, >3MB): Multi-iteration strategy with Pro + caching
  3. Focus iterations on distinct statistical patterns (correlations, outliers, trends)
  4. Target 50-200 high-quality quotes per iteration
  5. Ensure complete coverage of significant statistical findings
  6. Consider cross-document pattern analysis for complex findings

  STATISTICAL FOCUS AREAS TO CONSIDER:
  - Strong correlations and anti-correlations
  - Significant differences between groups/conditions
  - Outlier documents with extreme scores
  - Temporal or sequential patterns
  - Interaction effects between dimensions
  - Derived metrics validation needs

  Generate a plan that balances thoroughness with efficiency.
