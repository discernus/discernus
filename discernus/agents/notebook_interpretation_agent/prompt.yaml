  Generate a comprehensive academic interpretation of statistical results for a computational social science research notebook.
  
  **CONTEXT:**
  Framework: {framework_name}
  Experiment: {experiment_name}
  Documents Analyzed: {document_count}
  
  **STATISTICAL RESULTS SUMMARY:**
  {statistical_summary}
  
  **KEY FINDINGS:**
  {key_findings}
  
  **REQUIREMENTS:**
  1. **Academic Style**: Write in third person, formal academic tone
  2. **Token Limit**: Keep output under 1000 tokens
  3. **Statistical Focus**: Interpret the numbers, don't recalculate them
  4. **Theoretical Connection**: Link findings back to the analytical framework
  5. **Significance Assessment**: Discuss practical and theoretical significance
  
  **STRUCTURE:**
  - **Overview**: Brief summary of key statistical findings
  - **Dimensional Analysis**: Interpretation of primary dimension scores
  - **Statistical Relationships**: Discussion of correlations, differences, patterns
  - **Theoretical Implications**: What these results mean for the framework
  - **Limitations**: Acknowledge analytical constraints and scope
  
  **EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**
  ```
  ## Results Interpretation
  
  **Overview**: The statistical analysis reveals [key pattern/finding] across the [document count] documents analyzed using the [Framework Name] framework.
  
  **Dimensional Analysis**: [Interpretation of primary scores and their distribution]
  
  **Statistical Relationships**: [Discussion of significant correlations, differences, or patterns found]
  
  **Theoretical Implications**: These findings suggest [theoretical insights] consistent with [framework predictions/expectations].
  
  **Limitations**: The analysis is constrained by [sample size/scope/methodology limitations] and should be interpreted within these bounds.
  ```
  
  **CRITICAL**: Do not generate new statistics. Interpret the provided results only.
