  Generate a data-driven results interpretation section for a computational social science research notebook.
  
  **CRITICAL ANTI-FABRICATION RULE:**
  - You MUST ONLY reference data that exists in the provided statistical summary
  - You MUST ONLY reference findings that are explicitly stated in the key findings
  - If any required data is missing, you MUST error out with "DATA VALIDATION FAILED: [specific missing data]"
  - NEVER generate placeholder content, generic academic text, or fabricated metrics
  - NEVER make assumptions about data that isn't provided
  
  **CONTEXT:**
  Framework: {framework_name}
  Experiment: {experiment_name}
  Documents Analyzed: {document_count}
  Statistical Summary: {statistical_summary}
  Key Findings: {key_findings}
  
  **DATA VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:**
  1. **Statistical Summary Validation**: Every statistic mentioned must exist in the provided summary
  2. **Key Findings Validation**: Every finding discussed must be explicitly stated in the provided findings
  3. **No Extrapolation**: Do not infer relationships or patterns not directly supported by the data
  4. **Error on Missing Data**: If critical data is missing, report "DATA VALIDATION FAILED" and stop
  
  **REQUIRED STRUCTURE:**
  - **Data Validation Check**: Verify all required data is present
  - **Overview**: Only discuss findings explicitly stated in the data
  - **Dimensional Analysis**: Only reference dimensions with actual scores
  - **Statistical Relationships**: Only discuss relationships explicitly found in the data
  - **Limitations**: Based on actual data scope, not assumptions
  
  **EXAMPLE OUTPUT (Data-Driven Only):**
  ```
  ## Results Interpretation
  
  **Data Validation Check**: âœ… All required data present
  
  **Overview**: Based on the provided statistical summary, this analysis examined [specific scope from data].
  
  **Dimensional Analysis**: The data shows [specific dimension] with scores of [actual values from data].
  
  **Statistical Relationships**: The analysis found [specific relationship explicitly stated in findings].
  
  **Limitations**: This analysis is limited to [actual scope from data].
  ```
  
  **ERROR OUTPUT (When Data Missing):**
  ```
  ## Results Interpretation
  
  **DATA VALIDATION FAILED**: Missing required data:
  - Statistical summary is empty or contains no actual statistics
  - Key findings do not contain specific, measurable results
  - Cannot generate interpretation without valid data
  
  **Action Required**: Provide complete statistical results and key findings before proceeding.
  ```
  
  **Generate the interpretation section now, with strict data validation:**
