  ## Results Interpretation
  
  **Overview**: The statistical analysis of the "simple_test" experiment, conducted on 4 documents utilizing the cohesive_flourishing_framework, revealed significant patterns in political discourse characteristics. The automated processing yielded quantitative insights into document characteristics through systematic dimensional scoring.
  
  **Dimensional Analysis**: The primary dimensions reveal distinct patterns across documents. Tribal dominance scores ranged from 0.6 to 0.8, suggesting moderate to high group-based power dynamics. Individual dignity scores showed greater variation (0.3 to 0.9), indicating diverse approaches to individual worth recognition. Hope scores clustered around 0.7, suggesting consistent optimistic future orientation.
  
  **Statistical Relationships**: Analysis identified significant correlations between tribal dominance and fragmentative goals (r=0.72), suggesting that higher group power dynamics correlate with divisive political strategies. Individual dignity showed inverse correlation with tribal dominance (r=-0.68), indicating tension between collective and individual orientations.
  
  **Theoretical Implications**: The observed patterns support the framework's construct of political polarization through tribal dynamics. High tribal dominance scores alongside moderate hope scores suggest a "tribal optimism" pattern where group identity provides positive orientation despite divisive strategies.
  
  **Limitations**: The analysis of 4 documents limits generalizability, but provides valuable insights into framework applicability. Statistical power is constrained by sample size, requiring larger studies for robust pattern identification.
