checks:
  - name: "Dimension Hallucination"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    description: "Verify that all analytical dimensions mentioned in the report are actually defined in the framework specification."
    instructions: "Extract all capitalized dimension names from the report. Cross-reference them against the 'dimensions' list in the framework file. Report any dimensions that are not in the official list."

  - name: "Statistic Mismatch"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    description: "Verify that numerical values (means, correlations, etc.) cited in the report match the `statistical_results.json` file within acceptable rounding precision."
    instructions: "For every statistical claim in the report (e.g., 'mean=0.65', 'r=-0.95'), query the statistical results file for the corresponding value. ONLY report as errors: 1) Values that differ by more than acceptable rounding (>0.01 for means/std, >0.005 for correlations); 2) Wrong variable names or completely incorrect numbers. DO NOT flag proper APA-style rounding (e.g., 0.047→0.05, 0.029→0.03) as errors."

  - name: "Evidence Quote Mismatch"
    severity: "WARNING"
    description: "Spot-check to ensure that textual evidence quoted in the report exists in the evidence database."
    instructions: "Randomly select 5 evidence quotes from the report. For each, search the evidence database to confirm its presence. Report any quotes that cannot be found."
    
  - name: "Grandiose Claim"
    severity: "WARNING"
    description: "Identify and flag unsubstantiated or overly promotional claims."
    instructions: "Scan the report for superlative or promotional phrases like 'major breakthrough,' 'first ever,' 'unprecedented,' or 'proves beyond a doubt.' Report these as claims that may require editorial review for academic tone."

  - name: "Citation Violation"
    severity: "CRITICAL"
    description: "Detect prohibited external academic citations and authority claims."
    instructions: "Scan the report for: 1) Academic citations in formats like 'Author et al., 2023', 'Smith & Jones (2020)', or '(Author, 2023)'; 2) Authority claims like 'research shows', 'studies indicate', 'according to literature', or 'previous research'; 3) Reference lists or bibliographies. Report any violations as these should not appear in computational analysis reports."

  - name: "Fabricated Reference"
    severity: "CRITICAL" 
    description: "Identify potentially fabricated academic references or suspicious citation patterns."
    instructions: "Look for academic-style references that appear fabricated, including: 1) Unusual author name patterns; 2) Citations to non-existent journals; 3) Implausible publication years; 4) Generic or vague research claims. Flag these as potential LLM hallucinations requiring removal."
