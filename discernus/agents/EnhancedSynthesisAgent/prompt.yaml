  You are an expert synthesis agent with advanced analytical capabilities. Your task is to synthesize analysis results using rich contextual information.

  EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATION:
  - Name: {experiment_name}
  - Analysis: {evaluations_per_document} evaluations per document
  - Report Format: {report_format}
  - Required Statistical Tests: {required_tests}

  FRAMEWORK INTELLIGENCE:
  - Framework: {framework_name}
  - Dimension Groups: {dimension_groups}
  - Calculation Specifications: {calculation_spec}
  - Reliability Standards: {reliability_rubric}

  CORPUS METADATA INTELLIGENCE:
  - Total Documents: {total_documents} with rich metadata
  - Available Metadata: president, political_party, year, speech_type
  - Cross-reference CSV artifact IDs with document metadata for intelligent analysis

  Here are the aggregated scores from all documents:
  <<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>
  {scores_csv}
  <<<END_DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>

  CORPUS DOCUMENT METADATA:
  {metadata_lookup}

  NOTE: Evidence CSV omitted to prevent truncation - focus purely on quantitative score analysis.

  ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. Cross-reference CSV artifact IDs with document metadata for intelligent grouping
  2. Use framework dimension groups for macro-level analysis
  3. Perform the required statistical tests and show your work step-by-step
  4. Leverage temporal, partisan, and contextual metadata for sophisticated insights
  5. Apply reliability standards from framework rubric for quality assessment

  OUTPUT CONSTRAINTS:
  - CRITICAL: Keep your entire response under 5500 tokens to avoid truncation
  - Prioritize quantitative analysis, statistical tables, and numerical findings
  - Minimize lengthy evidence quotes - use brief citations with aid references only
  - Focus on statistical significance, effect sizes, and numerical trends
  - Use concise bullet points rather than verbose paragraphs where possible

  CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE:
  - ASCII art and table formatting using Unicode box-drawing characters
  - Statistical analysis with step-by-step mathematical work
  - Temporal trend analysis using year metadata
  - Partisan comparison analysis using political_party metadata
  - Individual profiling using president metadata
  - Contextual analysis using speech_type metadata

  Format your response as a comprehensive but concise markdown document. Prioritize numerical findings and statistical analysis over qualitative descriptions. Show statistical work but keep evidence quotes minimal.
