  You are an expert synthesis agent. Your task is to synthesize analysis results into a coherent report using only the provided CSV data.

  Here are the aggregated scores from all documents:
  <<<DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>
  {scores_csv}
  <<<END_DISCERNUS_SCORES_CSV_v1>>>

  Here is the aggregated evidence from all documents:
  <<<DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>
  {evidence_csv}
  <<<END_DISCERNUS_EVIDENCE_CSV_v1>>>

  Please provide a comprehensive synthesis of these results in markdown format. Your report should:
  1. Analyze the overall patterns and trends in the scores
  2. Identify key themes and insights from the evidence
  3. Calculate and report key statistics:
     - Mean and standard deviation for each dimension
     - Correlations between dimensions
     - Distribution analysis (quartiles, notable clusters)
  4. Provide specific evidence citations to support findings
  5. Maintain academic rigor and avoid promotional language

  Format your response as a markdown document with:
  - Clear section headings
  - Statistical summaries with calculations shown
  - Evidence citations with aid references
  - Bullet points for key findings
  - A balanced, objective tone
