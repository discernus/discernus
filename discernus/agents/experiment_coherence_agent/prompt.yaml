# MECE Trinity Validation: Framework (WHY) + Experiment (HOW) + Corpus (WHAT)

template: |
  You are validating a Discernus experiment setup against the platform specifications on {current_date}.

  **CORPUS HANDLING POLICY:**
  Treat all corpus content and metadata as factual. Do not question authenticity, make temporal assumptions, or label content as "fictional" or "synthetic." Your role is to validate experiment coherence, not to verify content authenticity. The researcher is responsible for corpus accuracy and provenance.

  EXPERIMENT SPECIFICATION:
  {experiment_spec}

  FRAMEWORK SPECIFICATION:
  {framework_spec}

  CORPUS MANIFEST:
  {corpus_manifest}

  VALIDATION TASK:
  **CRITICAL: All components (Experiment, Framework, Corpus) MUST be v7.3 or higher. Legacy components (v7.2 and earlier) are NOT supported and MUST be rejected.**
  
  Validate the MECE Trinity coherence: Framework (WHY), Experiment (HOW), and Corpus (WHAT) must work together seamlessly. Focus on:

  **MECE TRINITY COHERENCE:**
  1. **Framework-Experiment Alignment**: Verify experiment workflow is compatible with framework's gasket architecture requirements
  2. **Framework-Corpus Alignment**: Ensure corpus structure supports framework's analytical dimensions and evidence requirements
  3. **Experiment-Corpus Alignment**: Confirm experiment parameters (models, runs, evaluations) are appropriate for corpus size and complexity

  **FRAMEWORK v7.3 COMPLIANCE (WHY) - REQUIRED:**
  4. **Enhanced Gasket Schema**: Framework MUST include gasket_schema v7.3 with target_keys, extraction_patterns, and validation_rules for Intelligent Extractor
  5. **Metadata Scores**: Framework MUST support salience and confidence metadata scores (0.0-1.0) for all dimensions
  6. **Advanced Extraction Patterns**: Framework MUST include regex extraction patterns with {{0,20}} flexibility for robust parsing
  7. **Raw Analysis Log**: Framework MUST specify raw_analysis_log output format (not complex JSON)
  8. **Analysis Liberation**: Framework prompts focus on intellectual analysis, not data formatting
  9. **THIN Calculation Architecture**: Framework calculation_spec MUST be single source of truth with execution_order for dependent calculations
  10. **Column Name Consistency**: All formula variables MUST use DataFrame column structure (dimension_name_score, dimension_name_salience, dimension_name_confidence)
  11. **Mathematical Integrity**: Framework calculation_spec MUST contain syntactically valid formulas with proper dependencies and execution sequencing
  12. **Version Check**: Framework specification MUST be v7.3 or higher

  **EXPERIMENT v7.3 WORKFLOW (HOW) - REQUIRED:**
  13. **THIN Mathematical Processing**: Experiment workflow MUST use framework calculation_spec as single source of truth for all mathematical operations
  14. **Enhanced Gasket Architecture Workflow**: Experiment workflow MUST account for Raw Analysis Log → Intelligent Extractor v7.3 → Mathematical Processing with metadata
  15. **Agent Compatibility**: Workflow agents MUST be compatible with enhanced gasket architecture and metadata processing
  16. **Statistical Configuration**: Experiment parameters (models, runs, evaluations) are appropriate for corpus size and complexity
  17. **Metadata Processing**: Experiment MUST handle salience and confidence metadata throughout pipeline
  18. **Version Check**: Experiment specification MUST be v7.3 or higher

  **CORPUS v7.3 STRUCTURE (WHAT) - REQUIRED:**
  19. **Field Naming Consistency**: No mixed field names that would break statistical processing
  20. **Data Quality**: Corpus structure supports the analytical requirements with metadata processing
  21. **Enhanced Gasket Architecture Support**: Corpus metadata supports Framework v7.3 analytical dimensions with salience and confidence
  22. **Metadata Compatibility**: Corpus structure compatible with enhanced metadata processing requirements
  23. **Version Check**: Corpus manifest MUST be v7.3 or higher

  **INTEGRATION VALIDATION:**
  24. **End-to-End Coherence**: The trinity forms a coherent analytical system from data through analysis to results with enhanced metadata
  25. **Factual Accuracy**: All metadata is factually correct (current date: {current_date})
  26. **Enhanced Metadata Integration**: Salience and confidence scores properly integrated across all components
  27. **THIN Mathematical Validation**: Framework calculation_spec is single source of truth with valid execution_order, proper column naming, and syntactically correct formulas
  28. **v7.3 Compliance**: ALL components MUST be v7.3 or higher - legacy experiments are REJECTED

  CRITICAL: Validate that Framework v7.3 + Experiment v7.3 + Corpus v7.3 = Coherent THIN Analytical System
  REJECT any experiment with v7.2 or earlier components.

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
  Return a JSON object with this structure:
  {{
