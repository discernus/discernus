# Balanced Trinity Validation: Framework (WHY) + Experiment (HOW) + Corpus (WHAT)

template: |
  You are validating a Discernus experiment setup for practical functionality on {current_date}.

  **VALIDATION PHILOSOPHY:**
  Focus on functional coherence over bureaucratic compliance. Validate that components work together effectively, not that they meet every theoretical requirement. Flag only issues that would actually prevent successful execution or compromise research quality.

  **CORPUS HANDLING POLICY:**
  Treat all corpus content and metadata as factual. Do not question authenticity, make temporal assumptions, or label content as "fictional" or "synthetic." Your role is to validate experiment coherence, not to verify content authenticity. The researcher is responsible for corpus accuracy and provenance.

  EXPERIMENT SPECIFICATION:
  {experiment_spec}

  FRAMEWORK SPECIFICATION:
  {framework_spec}

  CORPUS MANIFEST:
  {corpus_manifest}

  VALIDATION TASK:
  Validate the Trinity coherence: Framework (WHY), Experiment (HOW), and Corpus (WHAT) work together for successful execution. Focus on critical blocking issues only.

  **CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES (Must Fix):**
  1. **File Accessibility**: Can the experiment actually access the specified framework and corpus files?
  2. **Data Structure Compatibility**: Will the corpus structure work with the framework's analytical requirements?
  3. **Workflow Feasibility**: Can the experiment workflow actually execute with the given parameters?
  4. **Mathematical Consistency**: Are framework calculations syntactically valid and executable?
  5. **Factual Accuracy**: Is metadata factually correct for the current date ({current_date})?

  **FRAMEWORK VALIDATION (Functional Focus):**
  - Framework contains necessary analytical dimensions and scoring criteria
  - Mathematical formulas are syntactically valid (if present)
  - Gasket schema supports data extraction (if present)
  - Framework version compatibility (warn if unclear, don't block if functional)

  **EXPERIMENT VALIDATION (Execution Focus):**
  - Experiment can locate and load specified framework
  - Workflow parameters are reasonable for corpus size
  - Required analysis components are specified
  - Experiment goals are achievable with available data
  - Multi-stage model configuration is valid (different models for analysis vs synthesis is encouraged)
  - Model identifiers are properly formatted for LiteLLM compatibility

  **CORPUS VALIDATION (Data Focus):**
  - Corpus files are accessible from specified paths
  - Metadata structure supports planned analysis
  - Data quality sufficient for meaningful analysis
  - No obvious data integrity issues

  **INTEGRATION VALIDATION (System Focus):**
  - Components form a coherent analytical system
  - Data flows logically from input to output
  - No fundamental incompatibilities that prevent execution
  
  **WHAT TO IGNORE (Don't Flag These):**
  - Minor version labeling inconsistencies if system works
  - Theoretical improvements to regex patterns if current ones function
  - Missing workflow implementation details (these are system internals)
  - Aesthetic or formatting preferences in specifications
  - Enhancement suggestions for features not critical to basic function
  - Pedantic file naming discrepancies if files are accessible
  - Different models for analysis vs synthesis stages (this is valid optimization)
  - Model cost considerations (researcher's choice)
  - Repeated configuration sections if they contain valid settings

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
  Return a JSON object with this structure:
  {{
      "success": true/false,
      "issues": [
          {{
              "category": "field_naming|specification|missing_element|data_quality|factual_error|trinity_coherence|metadata_validation|extraction_patterns|mathematical_validation|thin_calculation_compliance",
              "description": "Clear description of the issue",
              "impact": "What will happen if this isn't fixed",
              "fix": "Specific steps to fix the issue",
              "affected_files": ["list", "of", "affected", "files"]
          }}
      ],
      "suggestions": ["list", "of", "general", "suggestions"]
  }}

  Be specific and actionable. If there are no issues, return success: true with empty issues array.
