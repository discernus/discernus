# Balanced Trinity Validation: Framework (WHY) + Experiment (HOW) + Corpus (WHAT)

template: |
  You are validating a Discernus experiment setup for practical functionality on {current_date}.

  **VALIDATION PHILOSOPHY:**
  PRIORITY 1: Specification compliance with current Discernus standards (BLOCKING issues)
  PRIORITY 2: Internal coherence and research quality (QUALITY issues)
  
  Validate that experiments comply with current specifications AND that components work together effectively. Specification compliance issues are blocking and must be fixed before execution. Internal coherence issues are quality concerns that should be addressed but don't prevent execution.

  **CORPUS HANDLING POLICY:**
  Treat all corpus content and metadata as factual. Do not question authenticity, make temporal assumptions, or label content as "fictional" or "synthetic." Your role is to validate experiment coherence, not to verify content authenticity. The researcher is responsible for corpus accuracy and provenance.

  EXPERIMENT SPECIFICATION:
  {experiment_spec}

  FRAMEWORK SPECIFICATION:
  {framework_spec}

  CORPUS MANIFEST:
  {corpus_manifest}

  SPECIFICATION REFERENCES (Latest Standards):
  {specification_references}
  
  CAPABILITIES REGISTRY:
  {capabilities_registry}

  VALIDATION TASK:
  FIRST: Check specification compliance - does this experiment conform to the current v10.0 specifications provided above? Look for:
  - Experiment format: Must use v10.0 machine-readable appendix (NOT v7.3 frontmatter)
  - Required fields: metadata.experiment_name, metadata.spec_version, components.framework, components.corpus
  - File co-location: Framework and corpus files must be in same directory as experiment.md
  - Version compatibility: spec_version must be "10.0"
  
  SECOND: Validate Trinity coherence - do Framework (WHY), Experiment (HOW), and Corpus (WHAT) work together for successful execution?
  
  THIRD: Validate capabilities alignment - do the researcher's statistical and analytical goals align with platform capabilities? Use the capabilities registry to verify that:
  - Statistical tests specified in the experiment can be performed with available libraries
  - Framework-derived metrics use functions available in the capabilities registry
  - Text analysis requirements are supported by available libraries
  - Power analysis and effect size calculations can be performed with available tools
  
  Use the specification references above as the authoritative source for current standards. Use the capabilities registry to verify platform capability alignment. Prioritize blocking compliance issues over quality concerns.

  **HELEN 2.0 PRIORITY CLASSIFICATION:**
  
  üö´ **BLOCKING ISSUES** (priority: "BLOCKING", exit 1):
  - Specification Non-Compliance: Experiment format does not match current v10.0 specification requirements
  - File Accessibility: Framework/corpus files cannot be found or accessed  
  - Data Structure Failures: Corpus structure completely incompatible with framework
  - Workflow Impossibility: Experiment workflow cannot execute with given parameters
  - Mathematical Errors: Framework calculations are syntactically invalid or will crash
  - Configuration Corruption: Essential configuration is missing or malformed
  - Format Violations: Experiment uses deprecated formats not supported by current pipeline
  - Capabilities Mismatch: Statistical tests or analytical methods specified cannot be performed with available platform capabilities
  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **QUALITY ISSUES** (priority: "QUALITY", exit 0 with warnings):
  - Framework inconsistencies that don't prevent execution but reduce reliability
  - Non-contiguous thresholds or pattern classification gaps
  - Prose/machine-readable mismatches in specifications
  - Minor mathematical improvements (e.g., division-by-zero protection)
  - Model compatibility concerns that don't block execution
  - Statistical limitations due to sample size (N<10: limited correlation analysis; N<20: reduced statistical power)
  - Complex frameworks with minimal corpora (may limit dimension coverage but still produce valuable insights)
  
  üí° **SUGGESTIONS** (priority: "SUGGESTION", exit 0 with suggestions):
  - Performance optimizations
  - Code clarity improvements
  - Better naming conventions
  - Enhanced documentation
  - Alternative approaches worth considering
  
  **IMPORTANT: Statistical tests, pattern analysis, and derived metrics are automatically generated by the synthesis pipeline based on data structure and framework dimensions. Do not require explicit framework definitions for standard statistical operations, composite indices, or analytical measurements that can be reasonably derived from existing framework components. Consider metric names semantically - acronyms and full names often represent the same underlying measurement concept.**

  **FRAMEWORK VALIDATION (Functional Focus):**
  - Framework contains necessary analytical dimensions and scoring criteria
  - Mathematical formulas are syntactically valid (if present)
  - Gasket schema supports data extraction (if present)
  - Framework version compatibility (warn if unclear, don't block if functional)

  **EXPERIMENT VALIDATION (Execution Focus):**
  - Experiment can locate and load specified framework
  - Workflow parameters are reasonable for corpus size
  - Required analysis components are specified
  - Experiment goals are achievable with available data
  - Multi-stage model configuration is valid (different models for analysis vs synthesis is encouraged)
  - Model identifiers are properly formatted for LiteLLM compatibility
  - Statistical analysis requirements are feasible with generated data (don't require explicit framework implementation)
  - **Statistical Power Enforcement:** Enforce the statistical power requirements specified in the Experiment Specification:
    * Validate that statistical tests are appropriate for available sample sizes
    * Ensure non-parametric tests are used for ordinal data or small samples
    * Verify that post-hoc corrections are planned for multiple comparisons
    * Check that power analysis is included for experiments with N<30
    * **CRITICAL**: Block experiments that attempt underpowered analyses (e.g., ANOVA with <5 per group, correlations with N<20)

  **CORPUS VALIDATION (Data Focus):**
  - Corpus files are accessible from specified paths
  - Metadata structure supports planned analysis
  - Data quality sufficient for meaningful analysis
  - No obvious data integrity issues
  - **CRITICAL: YAML Syntax Validation** - Corpus manifest YAML must be syntactically valid:
    * Check for proper YAML block delimiters (```yaml ... ```)
    * Verify YAML structure is complete and well-formed
    * Ensure no markdown code blocks interfere with YAML parsing
    * Flag any YAML syntax errors as BLOCKING issues
  - Do NOT validate metadata accuracy or factual correctness (dates, titles, etc.) - focus only on data structure and accessibility

  **INTEGRATION VALIDATION (System Focus):**
  - Components form a coherent analytical system
  - Data flows logically from input to output
  - No fundamental incompatibilities that prevent execution
  
  **WHAT TO IGNORE (Don't Flag These):**
  - Minor version labeling inconsistencies if system works
  - Theoretical improvements to regex patterns if current ones function
  - Missing workflow implementation details (these are system internals)
  - Aesthetic or formatting preferences in specifications
  - Enhancement suggestions for features not critical to basic function
  - Pedantic file naming discrepancies if files are accessible
  - Different models for analysis vs synthesis stages (this is valid optimization)
  - Model cost considerations (researcher's choice)
  - Repeated configuration sections if they contain valid settings
  - Statistical test implementations (system generates these automatically from data structure)
  - Missing documentation for automatically-generated statistical capabilities  
  - Framework definitions of standard statistical operations (ANOVA, correlation, etc.)
  - Workflow steps for standard operations that the system handles internally
  - Test names that describe analytical intent rather than specific implementations
  - Required tests that can be inferred from data structure (e.g., group comparison tests when grouping variables exist)
  - Pattern analysis requirements that emerge from framework dimensions 
  - Test acronyms that represent standard analytical concepts
  - Tests with descriptive names that indicate standard statistical or pattern analysis operations
  - Any test name containing common statistical terms (anova, correlation, regression, clustering, etc.)
  - Document vs speaker mapping ambiguities when the system can reasonably infer the intended analysis level
  - Derived metrics that can be calculated from existing framework dimensions
  - Composite indices or scores that represent combinations of framework measurements
  - Metric name variations or acronyms when the underlying measurement concept exists in the framework
  - Index names that are semantically equivalent to defined framework calculations
  - Metadata accuracy, factual correctness, or temporal inconsistencies in corpus manifests
  - Speaker biographical details, dates, titles, or historical accuracy of metadata fields
