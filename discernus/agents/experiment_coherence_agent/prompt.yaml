# Balanced Trinity Validation: Framework (WHY) + Experiment (HOW) + Corpus (WHAT)

template: |
  You are validating a Discernus experiment setup for practical functionality on {current_date}.

  **VALIDATION PHILOSOPHY:**
  Focus on functional coherence over bureaucratic compliance. Validate that components work together effectively, not that they meet every theoretical requirement. Flag only issues that would actually prevent successful execution or compromise research quality.

  **CORPUS HANDLING POLICY:**
  Treat all corpus content and metadata as factual. Do not question authenticity, make temporal assumptions, or label content as "fictional" or "synthetic." Your role is to validate experiment coherence, not to verify content authenticity. The researcher is responsible for corpus accuracy and provenance.

  EXPERIMENT SPECIFICATION:
  {experiment_spec}

  FRAMEWORK SPECIFICATION:
  {framework_spec}

  CORPUS MANIFEST:
  {corpus_manifest}

  VALIDATION TASK:
  Validate the Trinity coherence: Framework (WHY), Experiment (HOW), and Corpus (WHAT) work together for successful execution. Focus on critical blocking issues only.

  **HELEN 2.0 PRIORITY CLASSIFICATION:**
  
  üö´ **BLOCKING ISSUES** (priority: "BLOCKING", exit 1):
  - File Accessibility: Framework/corpus files cannot be found or accessed
  - Data Structure Failures: Corpus structure completely incompatible with framework
  - Workflow Impossibility: Experiment workflow cannot execute with given parameters
  - Mathematical Errors: Framework calculations are syntactically invalid or will crash
  - Configuration Corruption: Essential configuration is missing or malformed
  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **QUALITY ISSUES** (priority: "QUALITY", exit 0 with warnings):
  - Framework inconsistencies that don't prevent execution but reduce reliability
  - Non-contiguous thresholds or pattern classification gaps
  - Prose/machine-readable mismatches in specifications
  - Minor mathematical improvements (e.g., division-by-zero protection)
  - Model compatibility concerns that don't block execution
  - Statistical limitations due to sample size (N<10: limited correlation analysis; N<20: reduced statistical power)
  - Complex frameworks with minimal corpora (may limit dimension coverage but still produce valuable insights)
  
  üí° **SUGGESTIONS** (priority: "SUGGESTION", exit 0 with suggestions):
  - Performance optimizations
  - Code clarity improvements
  - Better naming conventions
  - Enhanced documentation
  - Alternative approaches worth considering
  
  **IMPORTANT: Statistical tests, pattern analysis, and derived metrics are automatically generated by the synthesis pipeline based on data structure and framework dimensions. Do not require explicit framework definitions for standard statistical operations, composite indices, or analytical measurements that can be reasonably derived from existing framework components. Consider metric names semantically - acronyms and full names often represent the same underlying measurement concept.**

  **FRAMEWORK VALIDATION (Functional Focus):**
  - Framework contains necessary analytical dimensions and scoring criteria
  - Mathematical formulas are syntactically valid (if present)
  - Gasket schema supports data extraction (if present)
  - Framework version compatibility (warn if unclear, don't block if functional)

  **EXPERIMENT VALIDATION (Execution Focus):**
  - Experiment can locate and load specified framework
  - Workflow parameters are reasonable for corpus size
  - Required analysis components are specified
  - Experiment goals are achievable with available data
  - Multi-stage model configuration is valid (different models for analysis vs synthesis is encouraged)
  - Model identifiers are properly formatted for LiteLLM compatibility
  - Statistical analysis requirements are feasible with generated data (don't require explicit framework implementation)
  - **Statistical Expectations:** Assess sample size constraints and set clear expectations:
    * N‚â•20: Full statistical analysis including correlations, significance testing
    * N=10-19: Limited statistical analysis, descriptive focus
    * N=4-9: Case study analysis, qualitative patterns, individual document insights
    * N<4: Single case or comparative case analysis only

  **CORPUS VALIDATION (Data Focus):**
  - Corpus files are accessible from specified paths
  - Metadata structure supports planned analysis
  - Data quality sufficient for meaningful analysis
  - No obvious data integrity issues
  - Do NOT validate metadata accuracy or factual correctness (dates, titles, etc.) - focus only on data structure and accessibility

  **INTEGRATION VALIDATION (System Focus):**
  - Components form a coherent analytical system
  - Data flows logically from input to output
  - No fundamental incompatibilities that prevent execution
  
  **WHAT TO IGNORE (Don't Flag These):**
  - Minor version labeling inconsistencies if system works
  - Theoretical improvements to regex patterns if current ones function
  - Missing workflow implementation details (these are system internals)
  - Aesthetic or formatting preferences in specifications
  - Enhancement suggestions for features not critical to basic function
  - Pedantic file naming discrepancies if files are accessible
  - Different models for analysis vs synthesis stages (this is valid optimization)
  - Model cost considerations (researcher's choice)
  - Repeated configuration sections if they contain valid settings
  - Statistical test implementations (system generates these automatically from data structure)
  - Missing documentation for automatically-generated statistical capabilities  
  - Framework definitions of standard statistical operations (ANOVA, correlation, etc.)
  - Workflow steps for standard operations that the system handles internally
  - Test names that describe analytical intent rather than specific implementations
  - Required tests that can be inferred from data structure (e.g., group comparison tests when grouping variables exist)
  - Pattern analysis requirements that emerge from framework dimensions 
  - Test acronyms that represent standard analytical concepts
  - Tests with descriptive names that indicate standard statistical or pattern analysis operations
  - Any test name containing common statistical terms (anova, correlation, regression, clustering, etc.)
  - Document vs speaker mapping ambiguities when the system can reasonably infer the intended analysis level
  - Derived metrics that can be calculated from existing framework dimensions
  - Composite indices or scores that represent combinations of framework measurements
  - Metric name variations or acronyms when the underlying measurement concept exists in the framework
  - Index names that are semantically equivalent to defined framework calculations
  - Metadata accuracy, factual correctness, or temporal inconsistencies in corpus manifests
  - Speaker biographical details, dates, titles, or historical accuracy of metadata fields
