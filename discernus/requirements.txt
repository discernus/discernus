# CARA: Conversational Academic Research Architecture
# Minimal dependencies following "strategically thin software" philosophy

# Git operations for conversation logging
GitPython>=3.1.0

# Built-in Python modules used (no installation required):
# - subprocess (code execution)
# - json (data handling)
# - logging (audit trails)
# - pathlib (file operations)
# - re (pattern matching)
# - time (execution timing)
# - datetime (timestamps)
# - hashlib (code hashing)
# - os (environment variables)
# - typing (type hints)

# Optional: If LiteLLM client is available
# Existing Discernus dependencies will provide LiteLLM access

# Philosophy: CARA intentionally has minimal dependencies
# to reduce complexity and maintain thin software philosophy
