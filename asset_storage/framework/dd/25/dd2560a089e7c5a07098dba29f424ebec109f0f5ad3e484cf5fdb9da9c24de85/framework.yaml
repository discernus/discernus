version: v3.1.0
description: "Enhanced Moral Foundations Theory framework implementing Jonathan Haidt's\
  \ research \nwith systematic methodological improvements for academic rigor and\
  \ configurable \nalgorithm support. Uses the new axes-based coordinate system for\
  \ improved \nclarity and extensibility with LLM-prompting-amplification pipeline\
  \ integration.\n\n## Theoretical Foundation\n\nThis framework implements Jonathan\
  \ Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory, which identifies \ninnate psychological foundations\
  \ that cultures build upon to create diverse moral systems. \nThe theory proposes\
  \ that moral judgments are based on multiple foundations including \nCare/Harm,\
  \ Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation,\
  \ \nand Liberty/Oppression. This implementation uses an axes-based coordinate system\
  \ for \nimproved semantic clarity and mathematical rigor.\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\
  \nThis framework is designed for analyzing moral discourse in political texts, opinion\
  \ \npieces, and policy discussions. It identifies moral foundations present in text\
  \ and \nprovides quantitative scores for each foundation. Best used for:\n- Political\
  \ discourse analysis\n- Moral psychology research\n- Cross-cultural value studies\n\
  - Policy communication analysis\n\n## Version History\n\n- v3.1.0 (2025-06-25):\
  \ Updated to Framework Specification v3.1 compliance\n- v3.0.0 (2025-06-23): Added\
  \ configurable algorithms and axes-based architecture\n- v2.0.0 (2025-06-19): Enhanced\
  \ with systematic methodological improvements\n- v1.0.0 (2025-06-01): Initial implementation\n\
  \n## Citation Format\n\nWhen using this framework, cite as: \"Discernus Framework:\
  \ Moral Foundations Theory v3.1.0 (Discernus Research Team, 2025)\"\n"

    \ of vulnerable \nindividuals, concerns about fair treatment, group loyalty and\
    \ solidarity, \nrespect for authority and tradition, and spiritual or purity concerns.\
    \ \nAlso identify moral violations: harm, cheating, betrayal, subversion, degradation,\
