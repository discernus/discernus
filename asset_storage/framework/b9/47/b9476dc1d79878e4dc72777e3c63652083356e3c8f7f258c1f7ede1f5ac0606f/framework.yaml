description: "Simplified test version of Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory\
  \ framework \nfor system health testing and validation. This version matches the\
  \ main MFT \nframework structure but is optimized for testing scenarios.\n\n## Test\
  \ Framework Purpose\n\nThis framework is specifically designed for:\n- System health\
  \ monitoring and validation\n- Pipeline testing with known expected outputs\n- Framework\
  \ compatibility verification\n- Algorithm configuration testing\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\
  \nThis test framework should be used for:\n- **System Health Testing**: Validate\
  \ that the MFT analysis pipeline functions correctly\n- **Development Validation**:\
  \ Ensure framework loading and processing works before production\n- **Integration\
  \ Testing**: Verify compatibility with orchestrator and validation systems\n- **NOT\
  \ for Production Analysis**: This is a simplified test version only\n\nFor production\
  \ moral foundations analysis, use the main production framework instead.\n\n## Theoretical\
  \ Foundation (Simplified)\n\nBased on Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory with six\
  \ foundation pairs:\n1. **Care \u2194 Harm**: Compassion vs cruelty\n2. **Fairness\
  \ \u2194 Cheating**: Justice vs exploitation  \n3. **Loyalty \u2194 Betrayal**:\
  \ Group commitment vs disloyalty\n4. **Authority \u2194 Subversion**: Respect for\
  \ order vs chaos\n5. **Sanctity \u2194 Degradation**: Purity vs contamination\n\
  6. **Liberty \u2194 Oppression**: Freedom vs domination\n\n## Version History\n\n\
  - **v1.0** (2025-06-23): Initial test framework version\n  - Framework Specification\
  \ v3.1 compliant\n  - Six moral foundation axes with proper opposite_of validation\n\
  \  - Algorithm configuration for testing scenarios\n  - Compatible with system health\
  \ orchestrator\n\n## Citation Format\n\nDiscernus Framework: Moral Foundations Theory\
  \ Test v1.0 (Haidt, 2025)\n"
