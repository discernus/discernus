  - 'Haidt, J. (2012). The righteous mind: Why good people are divided by politics
    and religion.'
  - 'Graham, J., Haidt, J., Koleva, S., Motyl, M., Iyer, R., Wojcik, S., & Ditto,
    P. H. (2013). Moral foundations theory: The pragmatic validity of moral pluralism.

  - 'Haidt, J., & Joseph, C. (2004). Intuitive ethics: How innately prepared intuitions
    generate culturally variable virtues. Daedalus, 133(4), 55-66.'
  theoretical_approach: "Based on Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory which identifies\
    \ innate psychological \nfoundations that cultures build upon to create diverse\
    \ moral systems. Each foundation \nrepresents an evolved psychological mechanism\
    \ for addressing adaptive challenges \nfaced by humans living in groups.\n"
  core_insight: "Human morality is based on several innate psychological foundations,\
    \ not just care \nand fairness. People across cultures and political affiliations\
    \ differ in how much \nthey rely on each foundation.\n"

weighting_philosophy:
  description: Empirically-derived weighting based on systematic validation studies
  approach: empirical_validation_based
  status: Enhanced for academic rigor - weights derived from MFQ-30 factor analysis
  current_implementation:
    approach: Equal weighting pending empirical derivation
    rationale: All foundations weighted equally (1.0) until factor analysis determines
      optimal weights
    transparency_note: Avoiding arbitrary weight assignments criticized in computational
      frameworks
    critical_limitation: NO RESULTS PUBLISHABLE until empirical weights derived -
      current weights are provisional
  empirical_derivation_plan:
    study_design: Factor analysis of MFQ-30 data (n=1000+ participants)
    validation_method: ROC curve analysis for optimal weight combinations
    cross_validation: Multiple text corpora and cultural contexts
    statistical_justification: Complete documentation with confidence intervals
  interim_weighting:
    all_foundations: 1.0
    justification: Equal weighting eliminates arbitrary assumptions while maintaining
      theoretical structure
    note: Will be replaced with empirically derived weights following validation study
  theoretical_predictions:
    liberals: Expected higher weighting on individualizing foundations (Care, Fairness)
    conservatives: Expected more equal weighting across all foundations
    empirical_test: Predictions will be validated rather than assumed
validation_standards:
  academic_rigor_enhancement: Systematic validation protocols addressing computational
    framework vulnerabilities
  scope_limitations:
    current_validity: English-language political discourse only
    cultural_scope: Primarily US/UK political contexts
    cross_cultural_note: Cross-cultural claims removed - require separate validation
      studies
