prompt_configuration:
  bias_mitigation_approach: Enhanced prompts designed to prevent circular validation
  expert_role: "You are an expert in moral psychology and value analysis with deep\
    \ knowledge \nof how moral reasoning manifests in discourse across cultures and\
    \ political \norientations. You specialize in identifying implicit moral frameworks.\n"
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: "Analyze the values, principles, and moral reasoning\
    \ present in this text. \nIdentify what moral concerns are emphasized, what behaviors\
    \ are praised or \ncriticized, and what underlying value systems guide the reasoning.\n"
  detection_approach: "Look for patterns of moral reasoning including: protection\
    \ of vulnerable \nindividuals, concerns about fair treatment, group loyalty and\
    \ solidarity, \nrespect for authority and tradition, and spiritual or purity concerns.\
    \ \nAnalyze both explicit statements and implicit moral assumptions.\n"
  scoring_methodology: "Score moral dimensions based on textual evidence of value\
    \ emphasis, using \n0.0-1.0 scale with specific quotations supporting each assessment.\
    \ Focus on \nstrength of moral concern rather than political affiliation predictions.\n"
  enhanced_detection_instructions: "Beyond explicit moral vocabulary, identify: (1)\
    \ Syntactic patterns like moral \nimperatives and causal moral reasoning, (2)\
    \ Metaphorical expressions of values, \n(3) Narrative moral positioning and role\
    \ assignments, (4) Agent-patient \nstructures revealing moral agency, (5) Collective\
    \ identity construction patterns.\n"
