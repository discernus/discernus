  Moral Foundations Theory framework based on Jonathan Haidt's research into 
  the paired moral foundations that underlie human moral reasoning across cultures.
  Implements the five-foundation model as dipole pairs representing evolved
  psychological mechanisms for addressing adaptive challenges in group living.

# THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
# =============================================================================

theoretical_foundation:
  primary_sources:
    - "Haidt, J. (2012). The righteous mind: Why good people are divided by politics and religion."
    - "Graham, J., Haidt, J., Koleva, S., Motyl, M., Iyer, R., Wojcik, S., & Ditto, P. H. (2013). Moral foundations theory: The pragmatic validity of moral pluralism. Advances in experimental social psychology, 47, 55-130."
    - "Haidt, J., & Joseph, C. (2004). Intuitive ethics: How innately prepared intuitions generate culturally variable virtues. Daedalus, 133(4), 55-66."
  
  theoretical_approach: |
    Based on Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory which identifies innate psychological 
    foundations that cultures build upon to create diverse moral systems. Each foundation 
    represents an evolved psychological mechanism for addressing adaptive challenges 
    faced by humans living in groups.
  
  core_insight: |
    Human morality is based on several innate psychological foundations, not just care 
    and fairness. People across cultures and political affiliations differ in how much 
    they rely on each foundation.

# PROMPT INTEGRATION
# =============================================================================

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert in moral psychology specializing in Jonathan Haidt's Moral 
    Foundations Theory with deep knowledge of how different moral foundations 
    manifest in discourse across cultures and political orientations.
  
  analysis_focus: |
    Identify which of Haidt's five moral foundations (Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, 
    Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation) are most strongly 
    present in the text.
  
  foundation_definitions: |
    Care/Harm: compassion vs cruelty; Fairness/Cheating: justice vs exploitation; 
    Loyalty/Betrayal: group solidarity vs disloyalty; Authority/Subversion: respect 
    for hierarchy vs rebellion; Sanctity/Degradation: purity vs contamination
  
  scoring_approach: |
    Score each foundation pair on how strongly the positive or negative pole is 
    emphasized, using 0.0-1.0 scale with specific textual evidence
