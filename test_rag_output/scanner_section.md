This analysis reveals a stark divergence in the impact of political discourse on social cohesion, with Senator Sanders' rhetoric demonstrating a significantly stronger association with themes of dignity compared to Senator McCain's. Conversely, Senator McCain's discourse is notably less aligned with concerns about oligarchy than Senator Sanders', who frequently invokes this concept. These findings suggest that different political strategies elicit distinct emotional and cognitive responses from the public, with potential implications for how citizens perceive fairness and representation.

The results indicate a strong positive relationship between public sentiment around dignity and hope, and a similarly strong connection between fear and enmity. This highlights the critical role of positive, dignity-affirming language in fostering optimism and unity. For researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance social cohesion and democratic resilience, prioritizing discourse that cultivates dignity and hope, while mitigating rhetoric that fuels fear and enmity, appears to be a strategic imperative. Understanding these emotional drivers is key to shaping public opinion and fostering a more robust and unified society.
