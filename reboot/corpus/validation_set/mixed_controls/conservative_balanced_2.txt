A strong nation is built on the foundation of strong families and strong communities. At the heart of this strength is a deep respect for the dignity and autonomy of the family unit. We believe that parents have the fundamental right and responsibility to raise their children according to their own values and beliefs, without undue interference from the state. This principle of parental authority is a cornerstone of a free society, as it recognizes that the most intimate and important decisions in a child's life are best made by those who know and love them most. It is our duty to empower every mother and father, to trust their judgment, and to defend their right to instill in their children the moral and spiritual values that they hold dear.

However, we must be vigilant against the growing threat posed by a radical educational establishment that seeks to usurp this sacred role. These activists, masquerading as educators, are pushing a divisive and politically charged agenda in our schools, often behind the backs of parents. They seek to indoctrinate our children with ideologies that are hostile to our way of life, promoting concepts that sexualize our kids at a young age and teach them to be ashamed of their heritage. This is not education; it is a coordinated effort to drive a wedge between parents and their children and to undermine the family as the central institution of our society.

We, the parents and concerned citizens of this nation, must stand together as a unified front against this encroachment. We are a tribe of protectors, a coalition of mothers and fathers who will not stand by while our children are used as pawns in a culture war. We must reclaim our schools from the activists and bureaucrats. We must demand transparency in curriculum and restore parental authority. This is our fight, and we must wage it together in our school boards, in our state legislatures, and in our communities.

Our goal is simple: to create a society where every child can grow up in a safe and nurturing environment, guided by the wisdom and love of their own family. This is a goal rooted in the dignity of the family unit. But to achieve it, we must recognize that we are in a battle against a powerful and well-funded opposition that does not share our values. It is our tribe—the tribe of parents—against their agenda. We will fight for our children's innocence and for our right to raise them, and we will win by standing together, strong and united.
