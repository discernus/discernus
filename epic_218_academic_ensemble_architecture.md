# Epic #218: Academic Research-Aligned LLM Ensemble Architecture

## Executive Summary

Building on the comprehensive LLM parameter research (Issue #213), this epic implements a progressive ensemble optimization framework that aligns LLM selection and configuration with academic research workflows and methodological rigor requirements. The approach provides evidence-based, cost-optimized configurations across three distinct research phases: hypothesis exploration, structured experimentation, and publication preparation.
