# CURSOR AGENT QUICK START - Discernus Project

**30-second orientation for Cursor agents working on the 95% complete Alpha System**

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Critical Regression Protocol

**If you encounter a critical regression (experiments failing, core functionality broken):**

1. **IMMEDIATE STOP** - Do NOT attempt live debugging or expensive API experiments
2. **Document Issue** - Log in `pm/inbox.md` with ARCH-XXX identifier (use "inbox this" command)  
3. **Follow TDD Protocol** - Use proven 6-phase approach: `docs/developer/TDD_CRITICAL_REGRESSION_PROTOCOL.md`

**Success Story**: ARCH-002 batch processing regression resolved with ~$13 total cost using disciplined TDD vs $50+ for unstructured debugging.

## ðŸ“‹ NEW BACKLOG STRUCTURE (January 2025)

**Project management now uses streamlined workflow:**
- **"inbox this"** â†’ Quick capture to `pm/inbox.md` (no organization needed)
- **"groom our sprints"** â†’ Organize inbox items into `pm/sprints.md` 
- **"log it to done"** â†’ Archive completed items to `pm/done.md`

**Benefits**: Faster capture, context efficiency, better organization
