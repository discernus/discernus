Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war--seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.\nOne-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. \"Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.\" If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said \"the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\"\nWith malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations. \n\n---\n\nTRUMP'S 2025 INAUGURAL ADDRESS:\nDONALD J. TRUMP\nInaugural Address\nJanuary 20, 2025\nThank you. Thank you very much, everybody. [Applause] Wow. Thank you\nvery, very much.\nVice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice\nRoberts, Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, President\nClinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President\nHarris, and my fellow citizens: The golden age of America begins right now.\nFrom this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all\nover the world. We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow\nourselves to be taken advantage of any longer. During every single day of\nthe Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.\nOur sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of\njustice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of\nthe Justice Department and our Government will end.\nAnd our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and\nfree. America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than\never before.\n\nI return to the Presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start\nof a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the\ncountry, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the\nchance to seize this opportunity like never before.\nBut first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are\nplentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is\nnow witnessing in the United States of America.\nAs we gather today, our Government confronts a crisis of trust. For many\nyears, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth\nfrom our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in\ncomplete disrepair.\nWe now have a Government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at\nhome while, at the same time, stumbling into a continuing catalogue of\ncatastrophic events abroad.\nIt fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens, but\nprovides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from\nprisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from\nall over the world.\nWe have a Government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of\nforeign borders, but refuses to defend American borders or, more\nimportantly, its own people.\nOur country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as\nrecently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina—who have been\ntreated so badly—and other States who are still suffering from a hurricane\nthat took place many months ago or, more recently, Los Angeles, where we\nare watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token\nof defense. They're raging through the houses and communities, even\naffecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our\ncountry, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don't have a home\nany longer. That's interesting. But we can't let this happen. Everyone is\nunable to do anything about it. That's going to change.\nWe have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster,\nyet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.\n\nAnd we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed\nof themselves, in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we\ntry so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today,\nand it will change very quickly.\nMy recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible\nbetrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give\nthe people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed, their\nfreedom. From this moment on, America's decline is over.\nOur liberties and our Nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied. And\nwe will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of\nAmerica's Government.\nOver the past 8 years, I have been tested and challenged more than any\nPresident in our 250-year history, and I've learned a lot along the way. The\njourney to reclaim our Republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell\nyou. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and,\nindeed, to take my life.\nJust a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet\nripped through my ear. But I felt then and believe even more so now that\nmy life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great\nagain. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nThat is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will\nbe working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will\nmove with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and\npeace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.\nFor American citizens, January 20, 2025, is liberation day. It is my hope that\nour recent Presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and\nmost consequential election in the history of our country.\nAs our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our\nagenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of\nour society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic\nAmericans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural. And very importantly,\nwe had a powerful win in all seven swing States—[applause]—and the\npopular vote, we won by millions of people.\n\n\fTo the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the\ntremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with\nyour vote. We set records, and I will not forget it. I've heard your voices in\nthe campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.\nToday is Martin Luther King Day. And his honor—this will be a great honor.\nBut in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will\nmake his dream come true. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nNational unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is\nsoaring like never before. In everything we do, my administration will be\ninspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will\nnot forget our country, we will not forget our Constitution, and we will not\nforget our God. [Applause] Can't do that.\nToday I will sign a series of historic Executive orders. With these actions, we\nwill begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of\ncommon sense. It's all about common sense.\nFirst, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal\nentry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning\nmillions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they\ncame. We will reinstate my \"Remain in Mexico\" policy.\nI will end the practice of catch-and-release. And I will send troops to the\nsouthern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. Under the\norders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign\nterrorist organizations.\nAnd by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our Government\nto use the full and immense power of Federal and State law enforcement to\neliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing\ndevastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.\nAs Commander in Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our\ncountry from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to\ndo. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\n\n\fNext, I will direct all members of my Cabinet to marshal the vast powers at\ntheir disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down\ncosts and prices. The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending\nand escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a\nnational energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\nAmerica will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something\nthat no other manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil\nand gas of any country on earth, and we are going to use it. We'll use it.\nWe will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the\ntop, and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation\nagain, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.\nWith my actions today, we will end the \"green new deal,\" and we will revoke\nthe electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my\nsacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. In other words, you'll be\nable to buy the car of your choice.\nWe will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have\ndreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the autoworkers of\nour Nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with\ntheir vote.\nI will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect\nAmerican workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich\nother countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our\ncitizens.\nFor this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect\nall tariffs, duties, and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money\npouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources. The American\ndream will soon be back and thriving like never before.\nTo restore competence and effectiveness to our Federal Government, my\nadministration will establish the brandnew Department of Government\nEfficiency.\n\n\fAfter years and years of illegal and unconstitutional Federal efforts to\nrestrict free expression, I also will sign an Executive order to immediately\nstop all Government censorship and bring back free speech to America.\nNever again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to\npersecute political opponents, something I know something about.\n[Laughter] We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again. Under\nmy leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the\nconstitutional rule of law. And we are going to bring law and order back to\nour cities.\nThis week, I will also end the Government policy of trying to socially\nengineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We\nwill forge a society that is colorblind and merit based. As of today, it will\nhenceforth be the official policy of the United States Government that there\nare only two genders: male and female.\nThis week, I will reinstate any servicemembers who were unjustly expelled\nfrom our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full\nbackpay.\nAnd I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical\npolitical theories and social experiments while on duty. It's going to end\nimmediately. Our Armed Forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission:\ndefeating America's enemies.\nLike in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever\nseen. We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also\nby the wars that we end and, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never\nget into.\nMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That's what I\nwant to be: a peacemaker and a unifier. I'm pleased to say that as of\nyesterday, 1 day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East\nare coming back home to their families. [Applause] Thank you.\nAmerica will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most\nrespected nation on Earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire\nworld.\n\n\fA short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of\nMexico to the Gulf of America, and we will restore the name of a great\nPresident, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and\nwhere it belongs.\nPresident McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through\ntalent—he was a natural businessman—and gave Teddy Roosevelt the\nmoney for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal,\nwhich has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United\nStates—the United States—I mean, think of this—spent more money than\never spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the\nPanama Canal.\nWe have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have\nnever been made, and Panama's promise to us has been broken. The\npurpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated.\nAmerican ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any\nway, shape, or form. And that includes the United States Navy.\nAnd above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn't give it to\nChina. We gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.\nAbove all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once\nagain act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history's greatest\ncivilization.\nSo, as we liberate our Nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and\nsuccess. We will not be deterred. Together, we will end the chronic disease\nepidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.\nThe United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that\nincreases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our\nexpectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons.\nAnd we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American\nastronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.\nAmbition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and, right now, our Nation is\nmore ambitious than any other. There's no nation like our Nation.\n\n\fAmericans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers.\nThe spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great\nadventure resounds from within our souls.\nOur American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a\nvast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on\nEarth. No one comes close.\nAmericans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed\nwilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold\ndangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny,\nlifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched\nmankind into the heavens, and put the universe of human knowledge into\nthe palm of the human hand. If we work together, there is nothing we\ncannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.\nMany people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic\npolitical comeback. But as you see today, here I am. The American people\nhave spoken. I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe\nthat something is impossible to do. In America, the impossible is what we\ndo best.\nFrom New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago\nto Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, DC, our country was\nforged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they\nhad for our rights and for our freedom.\nThey were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers\nand coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched\nforward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.\nTogether, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built\ngreat highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism,\nand triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.\nAfter all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the 4\ngreatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore America\npromise and we will rebuild the nation that we love, and we love it so much.\n\n\fWe are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. So, to\nevery parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for\ntheir future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. We're\ngoing to win like never before. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nThank you.\nIn recent years, our Nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it\nback and make it great again, greater than ever before. We will be a nation\nlike no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism. Our power\nwill stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been\nangry, violent, and totally unpredictable.\nAmerica will be respected again and admired again, including by people of\nreligion, faith, and good will. We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we\nwill be strong, and we will win like never before.\nWe will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken,\nand we will not fail. From this day on, the United States of America will be a\nfree, sovereign, and independent nation.\nWe will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing\nwill stand in our way because we are Americans. The future is ours, and our\ngolden age has just begun.\nThank you. God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you very\nmuch. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nThank you.\n\n\fSwearing-In Ceremony of Donald J.
