# Background Executor - Autonomous Development Environment

**Problem Solved**: No more blocked terminal sessions when you step away! The Background Executor runs all Discernus services autonomously with proper virtual environment handling and comprehensive logging.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start all services and monitor autonomously
./scripts/dev_env.sh start

# Run Phase 3 pipeline test (10min timeout)
./scripts/dev_env.sh test

# Check service status
./scripts/dev_env.sh status

# View recent logs
./scripts/dev_env.sh logs

# Stop all services
./scripts/dev_env.sh stop
```

## Features

### âœ… **Autonomous Operation**
- All commands run in background without user interaction
- Virtual environment automatically activated
- Services monitored and auto-restarted if they crash
- Comprehensive logging to `logs/background_executor/`

### âœ… **Service Management**
- **Redis**: Auto-detected or started as needed
- **MinIO**: Auto-detected or started as needed  
- **Router**: Started with proper venv activation
- **Health Monitoring**: 30-second health checks with auto-restart

### âœ… **Test Integration**
- Phase 3 pipeline test with 10-minute timeout
- Full stdout/stderr capture and logging
- Clear pass/fail reporting
- No terminal blocking

### âœ… **Logging & Debugging**
- Each service gets its own log file
- Timestamped execution logs
- Easy access via `./scripts/dev_env.sh logs`
- Process IDs tracked for debugging

## Usage Examples

### Start Development Environment
```bash
./scripts/dev_env.sh start
# Services start autonomously, press Ctrl+C to stop
```

### Run Tests While Away
```bash
./scripts/dev_env.sh test
# Test runs completely autonomously, results logged
```

### Monitor from Another Terminal
```bash
./scripts/dev_env.sh status
./scripts/dev_env.sh logs
```

## Architecture

The Background Executor provides:

1. **Service Orchestration** - Manages Redis, MinIO, Router lifecycle
2. **Process Management** - Background processes with proper cleanup
3. **Health Monitoring** - Auto-restart failed services  
4. **Environment Isolation** - Proper virtual environment handling
5. **Comprehensive Logging** - Full audit trail of all operations

## Files Created

- `scripts/background_executor.py` - Main autonomous execution engine
- `scripts/dev_env.sh` - Simple command wrapper
- `logs/background_executor/` - Service logs and execution history

## Next Steps

**You can now step away freely!** The environment will:

- âœ… Keep services running autonomously
- âœ… Complete long-running tests without user interaction  
- âœ… Provide complete logs when you return
- âœ… Handle service failures gracefully
- âœ… Clean up properly when finished

**No more blocked terminals or interrupted workflows!** ðŸš€
