# Issue #374 Status Update

## Current Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE

### ‚úÖ Implemented Components:
- SequentialSynthesisAgent class created with 5-step pipeline
- synthesis_prompts.yaml with externalized YAML prompts
- Integration with ProductionThinSynthesisPipeline
- Framework-agnostic query generation (no hardcoded assumptions)
- Basic statistical integration with MathToolkit

### ‚ùå Critical Missing Components:
1. **Evidence Integration Bug**: Final reports lack direct textual quotes from retrieved evidence
   - Evidence is retrieved but not passed to final synthesis step
   - Violates Evidence-First synthesis constraint
   - Academic integrity standards not met

2. **Framework Fit Assessment**: Tiered approach (Gold/Silver/Bronze) not implemented
   - No quantitative framework fit conclusions in reports
   - Statistical variance analysis for explanatory power missing

### üîß Required Fixes:
1. Fix evidence aggregation in final_integration step
2. Strengthen prompt instructions for evidence citation
3. Implement framework fit assessment tiers
4. Add comprehensive testing

### Next Steps:
1. Debug and fix evidence linking in SequentialSynthesisAgent
2. Implement framework fit assessment methodology
3. Validate evidence-first synthesis with test runs
4. Update issue status to COMPLETE when evidence quotes appear in reports

**Current Completion: ~75%**
**Blocking Issue: Evidence integration bug prevents academic integrity compliance**
