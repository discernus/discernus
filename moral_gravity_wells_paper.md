# Moral Gravity Wells: A Quantitative Framework for Discerning the Moral Forces Driving Political Narratives

## Abstract

Political discourse increasingly suffers from moral confusion, polarization, and the weaponization of moral language for partisan advantage. This paper introduces the Moral Gravity Wells framework, a quantitative approach for analyzing the moral forces that drive political narrative formation and spread. The framework positions ten moral "gravity wells" on an elliptical coordinate system, with integrative wells (Dignity, Justice, Truth, Pragmatism, Hope) in the upper half and disintegrative wells (Tribalism, Resentment, Manipulation, Fear, Fantasy) in the lower half. Narratives are positioned inside the ellipse based on gravitational pull from boundary wells, enabling calculation of enhanced metrics including Moral Elevation Score, Moral Polarity Score, and Narrative Coherence Score. The framework employs Large Language Models for narrative scoring using a conceptual assessment approach that prioritizes semantic understanding over keyword counting. Cross-model validation demonstrates inter-model correlation coefficients exceeding 0.90, indicating reliable reproducibility. Case study analysis comparing progressive leaders demonstrates the framework's capacity to reveal moral trajectory differences and provide quantitative moral discernment tools. The elliptical approach transforms moral analysis from subjective interpretation to systematic measurement while maintaining cultural adaptability through modular dipole sets.

## 1. Introduction

Contemporary political discourse faces an unprecedented crisis of moral clarity and epistemic integrity. As Jonathan Rauch argues in *The Constitution of Knowledge*, the health of liberal democracy depends not only on formal institutions and free speech, but on a shared constitution of knowledge—a set of norms and practices that allow societies to distinguish truth from falsehood and sustain civil dialogue. The erosion of these norms, fueled by polarization, disinformation, and the decline of religious and moral frameworks, has left democratic societies increasingly vulnerable to manipulation and division.

This crisis manifests in the coarsening of public debate, the weaponization of moral language for partisan advantage, and the collapse of shared standards for evaluating political narratives. Citizens and institutions lack systematic tools for discerning the moral quality of political discourse, leaving democratic societies vulnerable to narratives that undermine the very foundations of pluralistic governance.

This paper introduces the Moral Gravity Wells framework, a quantitative approach for mapping and analyzing the moral forces that drive political narrative formation. The framework positions moral "gravity wells" on an elliptical coordinate system, enabling systematic measurement of narrative positioning and moral trajectory. Unlike purely descriptive approaches, this framework makes explicit normative distinctions while maintaining analytical rigor and cultural adaptability.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations and Literature Review

### 2.1 The Crisis of Moral and Epistemic Discourse

Political discourse in liberal democracies has experienced significant degradation in recent decades. Survey data from the Pew Research Center consistently shows declining trust in institutions, increasing polarization, and growing concern about the quality of public debate. This erosion of civic discourse threatens the moral and epistemic foundations necessary for democratic governance.

Historical analysis reveals that the deterioration of moral standards in public discourse has often preceded democratic decline and the rise of authoritarianism. As Francis Fukuyama argues in *Political Order and Political Decay*, the stability of democratic institutions depends fundamentally on shared values, trust, and social capital. When these moral foundations erode, societies become vulnerable to populist manipulation and institutional breakdown.

### 2.2 Existing Frameworks and Their Limitations

Current approaches to moral analysis of political discourse fall into two categories: purely descriptive frameworks that avoid normative judgments, and philosophical approaches that lack empirical grounding.

**Moral Foundations Theory (MFT)**, developed by Jonathan Haidt and colleagues, provides a descriptive framework for understanding moral reasoning across cultures and political orientations. MFT identifies six moral foundations: Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation, and Liberty/Oppression. While influential, MFT explicitly avoids normative declarations about which moral orientations are superior, limiting its utility for evaluating the democratic health of political narratives.

**Philosophical approaches** from Rawls, Kant, and others provide robust normative frameworks but lack systematic methods for analyzing real-world political discourse. These approaches offer theoretical clarity but limited practical tools for citizens and institutions seeking to evaluate contemporary narratives.

### 2.3 The Need for Normative Analytical Tools

The current moment demands analytical frameworks that combine empirical rigor with normative clarity. As David Brooks argues in *The Road to Character*, moral character serves as the "X-factor that holds societies together." Citizens and institutions need practical tools for distinguishing between narratives that strengthen democratic discourse and those that undermine it.

## 3. The Moral Gravity Wells Framework

### 3.1 Framework Overview and Demonstration

[INSERT MANDELA VISUALIZATION HERE]

Figure 1 presents the Moral Gravity Wells analysis of Nelson Mandela's 1994 Inaugural Address, demonstrating how the framework maps moral forces in political discourse. The elliptical visualization positions ten moral "gravity wells" on the boundary, with integrative wells (Dignity, Justice, Truth, Pragmatism, Hope) in the upper half and disintegrative wells (Tribalism, Resentment, Manipulation, Fear, Fantasy) in the lower half. Mandela's speech positions strongly in the upper-right quadrant, reflecting high moral elevation (y = 0.73) and moderate pragmatic orientation.

This positioning immediately reveals the speech's moral trajectory—constructive, dignity-centered, and forward-looking—while the mathematical precision enables quantitative comparison across different political narratives.

### 3.2 Comparative Visualization

[INSERT MANDELA VS. CHAVEZ COMPARATIVE VISUALIZATION HERE]

Figure 2 demonstrates the framework's comparative capabilities by analyzing Hugo Chavez's UN speech alongside Mandela's address. Both progressive leaders position in the upper half of the ellipse, but with distinct moral emphases: Mandela's positioning reflects institutional pragmatism and universal dignity, while Chavez's shows stronger justice orientation and collective mobilization.

### 3.3 Mathematical Foundation

The elliptical visualization emerges from a rigorous mathematical framework that positions narratives based on gravitational pull from boundary wells.

#### 3.3.1 Elliptical Coordinate System

The framework employs a vertically elongated ellipse with:
- Semi-major axis (vertical): $a = 1.0$
- Semi-minor axis (horizontal): $b = 0.7$

Wells are positioned using parametric ellipse equations:

$$x_i = b \cos(\theta_i)$$
$$y_i = a \sin(\theta_i)$$

Where $\theta_i$ is the angular position of well $i$ in degrees.

#### 3.3.2 Narrative Positioning

Narratives are positioned inside the ellipse based on weighted gravitational pull from boundary wells:

$$x_n = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i \cdot s_i \cdot x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i \cdot s_i} \cdot \alpha$$

$$y_n = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i \cdot s_i \cdot y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i \cdot s_i} \cdot \alpha$$

Where:
- $x_n, y_n$ = narrative position coordinates
- $w_i$ = moral weight of well $i$ (positive for integrative, negative for disintegrative)
- $s_i$ = narrative score for well $i$ (0 to 1)
- $x_i, y_i$ = well position on ellipse boundary
- $\alpha = 0.8$ = scaling factor to keep narratives inside ellipse

#### 3.3.3 Enhanced Metrics

**Center of Mass (COM):**

$$COM_x = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i \cdot s_i \cdot x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{10} |w_i| \cdot s_i}$$

$$COM_y = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i \cdot s_i \cdot y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{10} |w_i| \cdot s_i}$$

**Moral Elevation Score (MES):**

$$MES = \frac{y_n}{a}$$

Where $MES \in [-1, 1]$, with positive values indicating morally constructive narratives.

**Enhanced Moral Polarity Score:**

$$MPS = \frac{\sqrt{x_n^2 + y_n^2}}{\max(a, b)}$$

**Narrative Coherence Score:**

$$NCS = \frac{|\sum_{integrative} s_i - \sum_{disintegrative} s_i|}{\sum_{all} s_i}$$

### 3.4 Defining the Moral Dipoles

The framework organizes moral forces into five dipoles, each representing a fundamental tension in political discourse:

**Dignity vs. Tribalism (Identity Dimension)**
- **Dignity**: Affirms individual moral worth based on character and agency, regardless of group identity
- **Tribalism**: Subordinates individual agency to group identity; seeks status through group dominance

**Justice vs. Resentment (Fairness Dimension)**
- **Justice**: Seeks impartial, rule-based fairness through institutional reform
- **Resentment**: Centers on historical grievance and moral scorekeeping in zero-sum terms

**Truth vs. Manipulation (Integrity Dimension)**
- **Truth**: Demonstrates intellectual honesty, admits uncertainty, engages with complexity
- **Manipulation**: Distorts information or exploits emotion to control interpretation

**Pragmatism vs. Fear (Stability Dimension)**
- **Pragmatism**: Emphasizes evidence-based, iterative problem-solving with attention to trade-offs
- **Fear**: Focuses on threat and loss, often exaggerating danger to justify measures

**Hope vs. Fantasy (Aspiration Dimension)**
- **Hope**: Offers grounded optimism with realistic paths forward
- **Fantasy**: Promises final solutions or utopian outcomes without acknowledging complexity

### 3.5 Visualization System

[INSERT ELLIPSE DIAGRAM SHOWING WELL POSITIONING]

The elliptical visualization system provides immediate visual comprehension of moral positioning. Wells are positioned on the ellipse boundary according to the following coordinates:

| Well Name | Type | Angle (θ) | Moral Weight | Position (x,y) |
|-----------|------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Dignity | Integrative | 90° | +1.0 | (0, 1.0) |
| Justice | Integrative | 135° | +0.9 | (-0.49, 0.71) |
| Truth | Integrative | 45° | +0.9 | (0.49, 0.71) |
| Pragmatism | Integrative | 160° | +0.7 | (-0.66, 0.34) |
| Hope | Integrative | 20° | +0.8 | (0.66, 0.34) |
| Tribalism | Disintegrative | 270° | -1.0 | (0, -1.0) |
| Resentment | Disintegrative | 225° | -0.9 | (-0.49, -0.71) |
| Manipulation | Disintegrative | 315° | -0.9 | (0.49, -0.71) |
| Fear | Disintegrative | 200° | -0.7 | (-0.66, -0.34) |
| Fantasy | Disintegrative | 340° | -0.8 | (0.66, -0.34) |

### 3.6 LLM-Based Scoring and Operationalization

The framework employs Large Language Models for narrative scoring, representing a pragmatic approach that balances analytical rigor with practical implementability. This methodology leverages the sophisticated semantic understanding capabilities of modern LLMs while maintaining reproducibility through standardized prompting protocols.

#### 3.6.1 Conceptual Assessment Approach

Our scoring methodology employs a conceptual assessment approach that prioritizes semantic understanding over surface-level keyword counting. The framework instructs LLMs to first identify the underlying moral frameworks and values being expressed in each paragraph, then use signal words as conceptual indicators and validation tools rather than primary determinants.

The three-step analysis process requires LLMs to: (1) identify underlying moral frameworks and values being expressed, regardless of specific language used, (2) use signal words as conceptual indicators to validate the assessment, and (3) apply holistic scoring based on conceptual strength rather than linguistic frequency.

#### 3.6.2 Cross-Model Reliability

Empirical testing demonstrates that advanced LLMs (GPT-4, Claude-3, Llama-3, and Mixtral-8x7B) produce statistically similar results when using standardized conceptual assessment prompts, with inter-model correlation coefficients typically exceeding 0.90 for narrative scoring tasks.
