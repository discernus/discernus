# THIN Architecture Integration: Pre-Alpha Issues

## Issues to Close (Prototype Work Complete)
- [x] #167: AnalyticalCodeGenerator - IMPLEMENTED ✅
- [x] #168: CodeExecutor - IMPLEMENTED ✅  
- [x] #169: EvidenceCurator - IMPLEMENTED ✅
- [x] #170: ResultsInterpreter - IMPLEMENTED ✅
- [x] #171: Pipeline Orchestration - IMPLEMENTED ✅

## Issues to Update
- [ ] #166: Update to "Phase 1 Complete, Integration Ready" 
- [ ] #165: Close as "Superseded by THIN Architecture"

## New Integration Issues (Pre-Alpha Focused)

### Issue #175: Integrate THIN Synthesis into Main Codebase
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks  
**Epic**: #166

**Objective**: Replace legacy synthesis with validated THIN 4-agent architecture

**Scope**:
- Move prototype agents to `discernus/agents/thin_synthesis/`
- Update ThinOrchestrator to use THIN pipeline by default
- Integrate with existing infrastructure (MinIO, SecureCodeExecutor, AuditLogger)
- Test with existing experiments and frameworks

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Migrate 4 agents to main codebase with proper integration
- [ ] Update orchestration to use THIN synthesis by default
- [ ] Integration with existing artifact storage and security systems
- [ ] External YAML prompt management (following existing patterns)
- [ ] Testing across CAF, PDAF, CFF frameworks
- [ ] Performance validation on large experiments (40+ documents)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- THIN synthesis works as drop-in replacement for legacy synthesis
- Existing experiments run successfully with new architecture  
- Token truncation issues resolved (can handle 100+ document experiments)
- Performance meets or exceeds legacy approach

**Implementation Notes**:
- **Pre-alpha approach**: Direct replacement, not parallel implementation
- **Use existing infrastructure**: Don't rebuild MinIO, SecureCodeExecutor, etc.
- **Break things if needed**: Fix integration issues directly
- **Simple validation**: Run existing experiments to test

### Issue #176: Cleanup and Documentation  
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: 1 week
**Epic**: #166

**Objective**: Clean up after integration and document new architecture

**Scope**:
- Remove prototype directory once integration complete
- Update documentation for THIN synthesis architecture
- Update CLI help and user guides
- Performance benchmarking and optimization

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Remove `prototypes/thin_synthesis_architecture/` directory
- [ ] Update architectural documentation
- [ ] CLI documentation updates
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and comparison with legacy
- [ ] User migration notes (minimal for pre-alpha)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Clean codebase with integrated THIN architecture
- Updated documentation reflecting new synthesis approach
- Clear performance benchmarks available

## Timeline: 3-4 weeks total
- **Week 1-2**: Core integration (Issue #175, parts 1-2)
- **Week 3**: Testing and fixes (Issue #175, parts 3-4) 
- **Week 4**: Cleanup and documentation (Issue #176)

## Pre-Alpha Advantages
- **No backward compatibility**: Can replace legacy synthesis directly
- **Developer users**: Can adapt to changes quickly
- **Fast iteration**: Fix issues as they arise
- **Simple validation**: Existing experiments as test cases

This is a focused integration project appropriate for pre-alpha development stage.
