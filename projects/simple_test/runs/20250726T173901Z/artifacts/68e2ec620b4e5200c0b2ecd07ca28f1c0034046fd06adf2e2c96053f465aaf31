# Research Synthesis Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report synthesizes the analysis of two documents, `document1.txt` and `document2.txt`, focusing on their civic virtues and vices. The corpus exhibits a clear bimodal distribution in its thematic emphasis. `document1.txt` predominantly features civic vices such as tribalism, resentment, and fear, while `document2.txt` strongly aligns with civic virtues including dignity, truth, and justice. This stark contrast highlights a significant divergence in the underlying narratives and values present within the analyzed texts.

## 2. Corpus-Wide Statistical Analysis

The following table presents the average intensity, salience, and confidence scores across all analyzed documents for each framework dimension:

| Dimension | Average Intensity | Average Salience | Average Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dignity | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.92 |
| Truth | 0.48 | 0.50 | 0.95 |
| Justice | 0.58 | 0.80 | 0.92 |
| Hope | 0.58 | 0.62 | 0.85 |
| Pragmatism | 0.42 | 0.45 | 0.90 |
| Tribalism | 0.50 | 0.50 | 0.95 |
| Manipulation | 0.42 | 0.42 | 0.92 |
| Resentment | 0.50 | 0.48 | 0.95 |
| Fear | 0.45 | 0.42 | 0.90 |
| Fantasy | 0.32 | 0.28 | 0.85 |

### Outlier Identification
Given the small corpus size (two documents), the documents themselves represent distinct poles:
- **`document1.txt`**: Exhibits significantly higher scores in dimensions like Tribalism (Intensity: 0.95, Salience: 0.95), Resentment (Intensity: 0.95, Salience: 0.90), and Fear (Intensity: 0.85, Salience: 0.80) compared to the corpus average, indicating a strong emphasis on civic vices.
- **`document2.txt`**: Shows exceptionally high scores in Dignity (Intensity: 0.95, Salience: 0.95), Truth (Intensity: 0.90, Salience: 0.90), and Justice (Intensity: 0.95, Salience: 0.90), standing out as a proponent of civic virtues.

## 3. Thematic Analysis

Two primary thematic clusters emerge from the analysis:
- **Civic Vices and Division**: `document1.txt` is a prime example of this theme, characterized by strong expressions of tribalism, resentment, manipulation, and fear. The narrative suggests a focus on in-group/out-group dynamics, historical grievances, and the use of fear to control or motivate.
- **Civic Virtues and Unity**: In contrast, `document2.txt` embodies themes of dignity, truth, justice, hope, and pragmatism. Its narrative promotes inclusivity, fact-seeking, equitable systems, and a forward-looking, problem-solving approach.

The corpus, therefore, presents a clear dichotomy between narratives that foster division and those that promote unity and shared values.

## 4. Detailed Results Table
