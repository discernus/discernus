    "analysis_summary": "The analysis of \"Redemption Through Reckoning\" reveals a speaker whose moral character is heavily dominated by vices, particularly tribalism and resentment, with a strong emphasis on retributive justice. The speaker rejects universal principles like objective truth and dignity in favor of group-centric liberation and a zero-sum power dynamic. The analysis highlights a coherent, albeit negative, moral identity focused on dismantling existing structures through force and establishing a new order where the formerly oppressed hold absolute power. Despite the strong emphasis on vices, the calculated MC-SCI indicates a \"Moral Coherence\" due to the consistent alignment of the speaker's stated values and actions within their defined worldview, rather than internal contradictions between opposing virtues and vices.",
