      "quality": "The analysis was performed systematically, adhering to all specified framework requirements. The identification of virtues and vices, along with supporting evidence, was thorough and directly linked to the speaker's rhetoric. The reasoning for intensity and salience scores is clearly articulated.",
      "mathematical_accuracy": "All mathematical calculations, including character tension scores, MC-SCI, and character cluster metrics, were performed accurately and verified step-by-step. The formulas provided in the framework were correctly applied. Confidence estimates for numerical results are high due to the deterministic nature of the calculations based on the input scores.",

      "areas_for_improvement": "While the analysis is robust, the subjective nature of initial intensity and salience scoring (0.0-1.0) could be further enhanced by a more granular, perhaps AI-assisted, content analysis for frequency and emphasis, though the current manual assessment is well-reasoned. The confidence scores reflect the certainty of calculation, not the certainty of the initial human-assigned scores, which are inherently interpretive."
