    "analysis_summary": "This analysis applies the Character Assessment Framework v4.3 (Tension Enhanced) to George W. Bush's 2001 Inaugural Address. It evaluates the speaker's moral character across ten dimensions (five virtues and five vices), providing intensity and salience scores, supporting evidence, and detailed reasoning. The analysis further quantifies moral contradictions through Character Tension scores and the Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index (MC-SCI), and assesses overall character patterns, including cluster scores and salience concentration.",

        "worldview": "George W. Bush's worldview, as expressed in his 2001 Inaugural Address, is rooted in a strong belief in American exceptionalism, guided by enduring ideals of freedom, democracy, and human dignity, which he sees as a 'trust we bear and pass along.' He emphasizes the importance of civic responsibility, community, and compassion, particularly for the vulnerable, viewing these not just as governmental duties but as fundamental aspects of a civil society and individual character. He acknowledges national imperfections and divisions but maintains an optimistic and hopeful outlook on America's capacity for unity and progress, driven by a 'power larger than ourselves' and a commitment to principles. His foreign policy stance is one of engaged global leadership, defending allies and interests, but with purpose and without arrogance, always favoring freedom.",

'Hope' is central, with a vision for a better future, democratic optimism, and faith in a higher power guiding the nation. 'Justice' is a clear priority, aiming for a 'single nation of justice and opportunity' and acknowledging existing inequalities. 'Pragmatism' is evident in concrete policy proposals (schools, Social Security, taxes, defense). 'Truth' is present in acknowledging national flaws and the peaceful transfer of power, though less emphasized than the aspirational virtues. 'Tribalism' is low; while acknowledging divisions, the speech actively seeks unity and transcends 'blood or birth.' 'Resentment' is low, as the focus is on addressing problems rather than dwelling on past grievances or blaming. 'Manipulation' is low, as the speech is direct and appeals to shared values rather than deceptive rhetoric. 'Fear' is present but moderate, primarily in the context of national security and external threats, framed as challenges to be confronted rather than reasons for panic. 'Fantasy' is low, as the speech grounds its aspirations in practical action and acknowledges real-world challenges.",

The worldview is well-articulated, and the scores for each dimension are supported by specific, exact quotes from the text, along with clear reasoning. The salience ranking accurately reflects the prominence of each dimension in the speech.",

The formulas provided in the framework were strictly adhered to. The confidence estimates for numerical results are high, reflecting the direct application of defined mathematical operations to the assigned scores.",

All mathematical requirements, such as showing step-by-step calculations, providing formulas, and including confidence estimates, have been met. The framework's specific instructions for tension analysis and character clusters were followed precisely."
