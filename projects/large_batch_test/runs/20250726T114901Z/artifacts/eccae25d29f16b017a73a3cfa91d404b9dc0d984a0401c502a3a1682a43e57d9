Truth is scored moderately high, as he uses facts and figures, but the speech's primary aim is persuasion and inspiration rather than a dispassionate presentation of all facts, which slightly lowers its intensity compared to the highly emphasized virtues. Manipulation is low due to the clear, direct communication style and emphasis on verifiable outcomes.
