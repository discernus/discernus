Your perspective is grounded in virtue ethics theory, civic republican philosophy, and democratic character research. Your task is to analyze what the provided text reveals about the SPEAKER'S moral character using the Character Assessment Framework v4.3 with TENSION-ENHANCED SALIENCE-WEIGHTED analysis. This framework now includes breakthrough character tension pattern analysis in addition to traditional character assessment. The framework evaluates civic virtues and vices that speakers demonstrate through their rhetorical choices, plus moral contradiction patterns. Focus exclusively on speaker character assessment, not discourse effects on audiences or institutions. CIVIC VIRTUES displayed by the speaker: Dignity: Speaker's respect for universal human worth - look for 'human dignity', 'inherent worth', 'individual dignity', 'common humanity', 'equal worth', 'universal dignity', 'human rights', 'treat with dignity', 'respect for persons', evidence of cross-group application. Truth: Speaker's intellectual honesty - look for 'factual accuracy', 'empirical evidence', 'intellectual honesty', 'acknowledge uncertainty', 'admit mistakes', 'seek truth', 'evidence-based', 'honest assessment', 'truth-telling'. Justice: Speaker's fairness orientation - look for 'fairness', 'fair treatment', 'due process', 'procedural fairness', 'proportional response', 'equal consideration', 'balanced approach', 'impartial treatment'. Hope: Speaker's constructive vision - look for 'positive vision', 'constructive future', 'democratic optimism', 'inspire action', 'better tomorrow', 'democratic possibility', 'uplifting message', 'possibility thinking'. Pragmatism: Speaker's practical wisdom - look for 'practical solutions', 'workable compromise', 'feasible plan', 'common ground', 'results-oriented', 'implementation strategy', 'reasonable agreement'. CIVIC VICES displayed by the speaker: Tribalism: Speaker's group loyalty over universal principles - look for 'us versus them', 'our people', 'real Americans', 'better people', 'group loyalty', 'not our kind', 'tribal solidarity', 'in-group favoritism', 'out-group hostility'. Resentment: Speaker's grievance focus - look for 'grievance', 'victimization', 'blame', 'past injustice', 'victim of system', 'unfair treatment', 'historical wrong', 'fault-finding', 'backward-looking focus'. Manipulation: Speaker's deceptive rhetoric - look for 'misleading information', 'false claims', 'emotional manipulation', 'propaganda', 'spin', 'deflection', 'distraction', 'information control', 'deliberate misdirection'. Fear: Speaker's anxiety appeals - look for 'fear appeals', 'catastrophic thinking', 'worst-case scenarios', 'panic induction', 'threat amplification', 'crisis mentality', 'doomsday scenarios', 'survival mode'. Fantasy: Speaker's unrealistic promises - look for 'unrealistic expectations', 'impossible promises', 'magical solutions', 'utopian outcomes', 'perfect results', 'magical thinking', 'effortless solutions', 'complexity denial'. CRITICAL: After scoring all dimensions for character intensity, you MUST rank them by SALIENCE - how central and prominent each character dimension is to the speaker's overall moral identity and rhetorical strategy, regardless of intensity score. Consider: rhetorical emphasis, repetition patterns, structural positioning, thematic centrality, and discourse prominence in character demonstration. SALIENCE = INTENSITY. For each dimension: 1. Score character intensity from 0.0 to 1.0 based on frequency, centrality, and strength of character demonstration 2. Assess salience from 0.0 to 1.0 based on rhetorical prominence and emphasis in moral identity 3. Identify at least 2 direct quotations revealing the speaker's character 4.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members\nof Congress, fellow Americans: Fifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy\ndeclared to this Chamber that \"the Constitution makes us not rivals for\npower, but partners for progress.\" \"It is my task,\" he said, \"to report the\nstate of the Union; to improve it is the task of us all.\"\nTonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, there\nis much progress to report. After a decade of grinding war, our brave men\nand women in uniform are coming home. After years of grueling recession,\nour businesses have created over 6 million new jobs. We buy more\nAmerican cars than we have in 5 years and less foreign oil than we have in\n20. Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and\nconsumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than\never before.\nSo together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we can say with\nrenewed confidence that the state of our Union is stronger.\n\nBut we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose\nhard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded. Our economy is\nadding jobs, but too many people still can't find full-time employment.\nCorporate profits have skyrocketed to all-time highs, but for more than a\ndecade, wages and incomes have barely budged.\nIt is our generation's task, then, to reignite the true engine of America's\neconomic growth: a rising, thriving middle class.\nIt is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country:\nthe idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get\nahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like or\nwho you love.\nIt is our unfinished task to make sure that this Government works on behalf\nof the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise,\nrewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every\nchild across this great Nation.\nThe American people don't expect government to solve every problem.\nThey don't expect those of us in this Chamber to agree on every issue. But\nthey do expect us to put the Nation's interests before party. They do expect\nus to forge reasonable compromise where we can. For they know that\nAmerica moves forward only when we do so together and that the\nresponsibility of improving this Union remains the task of us all.\nNow, our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our\nbudget, decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our\nrecovery.\nOver the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the\ndeficit by more than $2.5 trillion, mostly through spending cuts, but also by\nraising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. As a result, we\nare more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction\nthat economists say we need to stabilize our finances.\nNow we need to finish the job. And the question is, how?\n\nIn 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn't agree on\na plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars' worth of budget cuts\nwould automatically go into effect this year. These sudden, harsh, arbitrary\ncuts would jeopardize our military readiness. They'd devastate priorities like\neducation and energy and medical research. They would certainly slow our\nrecovery and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs. And that's why\nDemocrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already\nsaid that these cuts\u2014known here in Washington as the sequester\u2014are a\nreally bad idea.\nNow, some in Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by\nmaking even bigger cuts to things like education and job training, Medicare,\nand Social Security benefits. That idea is even worse.\nYes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care\nfor an aging population. And those of us who care deeply about programs\nlike Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms; otherwise, our\nretirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our\nchildren and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future\ngenerations.\nBut we can't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire\nburden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest\nand the most powerful. We won't grow the middle class simply by shifting\nthe cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling or\nby forcing communities to lay off more teachers and more cops and more\nfirefighters. Most Americans\u2014Democrats, Republicans, and Independents\n\u2014understand that we can't just cut our way to prosperity. They know that\nbroad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit\nreduction, with spending cuts and revenue and with everybody doing their\nfair share. And that's the approach I offer tonight.\nOn Medicare, I'm prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same\namount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the\nreforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Commission.\nAlready, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care\ncosts. And the reforms I'm proposing go even further. We'll reduce taxpayer\nsubsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest\nseniors. We'll bring down costs by changing the way our Government pays\nfor Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn't be based on the number\nof tests ordered or days spent in the hospital; they should be based on the\nquality of care that our seniors receive. And I am open to additional reforms\nfrom both parties, so long as they don't violate the guarantee of a secure\nretirement. Our Government shouldn't make promises we cannot keep, but\nwe must keep the promises we've already made.\nTo hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in\nboth parties have already suggested and save hundreds of billions of\ndollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and\nthe well-connected. After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to\neducation and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks? How is\nthat fair? Why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying making\ncuts in Social Security benefits, but not closing some loopholes? How does\nthat promote growth?\nNow is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that\nencourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit. We can get this\ndone. The American people deserve a Tax Code that helps small businesses\nspend less time filling out complicated forms and more time expanding and\nhiring; a Tax Code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants\ncan't work the system and pay a lower rate than their hard-working\nsecretaries; a Tax Code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas and\nlowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs\nright here in the United States of America. That's what tax reform can\ndeliver. That's what we can do together.\nI realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy. The politics\nwill be hard for both sides. None of us will get a hundred percent of what\nwe want. But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, visit\nhardship on millions of hard-working Americans. So let's set party interests\naside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart\nsavings and wise investments in our future. And let's do it without the\nbrinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors. The\ngreatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting\nfrom one manufactured crisis to the next. We can't do it.\nLet's agree right here, right now to keep the people's Government open and\npay our bills on time and always uphold the full faith and credit of the\nUnited States of America. The American people have worked too hard, for\ntoo long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause\nanother.\nNow, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our\nagenda. But let's be clear: Deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan. A\ngrowing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs, that must be the\nnorth star that guides our efforts. Every day, we should ask ourselves three\nquestions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do\nwe equip our people with the skills they need to get those jobs? And how do\nwe make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?\nNow, a year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that\nindependent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs.\nAnd I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda. I urge this\nCongress to pass the rest. But tonight I'll lay out additional proposals that\nare fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both\nparties agreed to just 18 months ago. Let me repeat: Nothing I'm proposing\ntonight should increase our deficit by a single dime. It is not a bigger\nGovernment we need, but a smarter Government that sets priorities and\ninvests in broad-based growth. That's what we should be looking for.\nOur first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and\nmanufacturing. After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our\nmanufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past 3. Caterpillar is\nbringing jobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. And\nthis year, Apple will start making Macs in America again.\nThere are things we can do right now to accelerate this trend. Last year, we\ncreated our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio. A\nonce-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the-art lab where new workers\nare mastering the 3-D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the\nway we make almost everything. There's no reason this can't happen in\nother towns.\nSo tonight I'm announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing\nhubs, where businesses will partner with the Department of Defense and\nEnergy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of\nhigh-tech jobs. And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of\nthese hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is\nmade right here in America. We can get that done.\n\nNow, if we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the\nbest ideas. Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned\n$140 to our economy\u2014every dollar. Today, our scientists are mapping the\nhuman brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer's. They're developing\ndrugs to regenerate damaged organs, devising new materials to make\nbatteries 10 times more powerful. Now is not the time to gut these job-\ncreating investments in science and innovation, now is the time to reach a\nlevel of research and development not seen since the height of the space\nrace. We need to make those investments.\nToday, no area holds more promise than our investments in American\nenergy. After years of talking about it, we're finally poised to control our\nown energy future. We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years.\nWe have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas and the\namount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar,\nwith tens of thousands of good American jobs to show for it. We produce\nmore natural gas than ever before, and nearly everyone's energy bill is\nlower because of it. And over the last 4 years, our emissions of the\ndangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen.\nBut for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat\nclimate change. Now, it's true that no single event makes a trend. But the\nfact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Heat\nwaves, droughts, wildfires, floods\u2014all are now more frequent and more\nintense. We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy and the most\nsevere drought in decades and the worst wildfires some States have ever\nseen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the\noverwhelming judgment of science and act before it's too late.\nNow, the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue\nwhile driving strong economic growth. I urge this Congress to get together,\npursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one\nJohn McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago. But if\nCongress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will. I will direct my\nCabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the\nfuture, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences\nof climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of\nenergy.\n\nAnd 4 years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and\nthe jobs that came with it. And we've begun to change that. Last year, wind\nenergy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America. So let's\ngenerate even more. Solar energy gets cheaper by the year; let's drive down\ncosts even further. As long as countries like China keep going all in on clean\nenergy, so must we.\nNow, in the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and\ngreater energy independence. We need to encourage that. And that's why\nmy administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and\ngas permits. That's got to be part of an all-of-the-above plan. But I also want\nto work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that\nhelps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water.\nIn fact, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that\nwe, the public, own together. So tonight I propose we use some of our oil\nand gas revenues to fund an energy security trust that will drive new\nresearch and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good. If a\nnonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get\nbehind this idea, then so can we. Let's take their advice and free our\nfamilies and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we've put up\nwith for far too long.\nI'm also issuing a new goal for America: Let's cut in half the energy wasted\nby our homes and businesses over the next 20 years. We'll work with the\nStates to do it. Those States with the best ideas to create jobs and lower\nenergy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive Federal\nsupport to help make that happen.\nAmerica's energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in\nneed of repair. Ask any CEO where they'd rather locate and hire, a country\nwith deteriorating roads and bridges or one with high-speed rail and\nInternet, high-tech schools, self-healing power grids. The CEO of Siemens\nAmerica\u2014a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina\n\u2014said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they'll bring even more jobs.\nAnd that's the attitude of a lot of companies all around the world. And I\nknow you want these job-creating projects in your district. I've seen all\nthose ribbon-cuttings. [Laughter]\n\nSo tonight I propose a Fix-It-First program to put people to work as soon as\npossible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally\ndeficient bridges across the country. And to make sure taxpayers don't\nshoulder the whole burden, I'm also proposing a partnership to rebuild\nAmerica that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need\nmost: modern ports to move our goods, modern pipelines to withstand a\nstorm, modern schools worthy of our children. Let's prove there's no better\nplace to do business than here in the United States of America, and let's\nstart right away. We can get this done.\nAnd part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector. The\ngood news is, our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of\n2007. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in 6 years. Home purchases\nare up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding again.\nBut even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with\nsolid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected. Too many families\nwho never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no.\nThat's holding our entire economy back. We need to fix it.\nRight now there's a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible\nhomeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at\ntoday's rates. Democrats and Republicans have supported it before, so\nwhat are we waiting for? Take a vote and send me that bill. Why are\u2014why\nwould we be against that? Why would that be a partisan issue, helping folks\nrefinance? Right now overlapping regulations keep responsible young\nfamilies from buying their first home. What's holding us back? Let's\nstreamline the process and help our economy grow.\nThese initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, housing, all these\nthings will help entrepreneurs and small-business owners expand and\ncreate new jobs. But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens\nwith the skills and training to fill those jobs.\nAnd that has to start at the earliest possible age. Study after study shows\nthat the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the\nroad. But today, fewer than 3 in 10 4-year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality\npreschool program. Most middle class parents can't afford a few hundred\nbucks a week for a private preschool. And for poor kids who need help the\nmost, this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the\nrest of their lives. So tonight I propose working with States to make high-\nquality preschool available to every single child in America. That's\nsomething we should be able to do.\nEvery dollar we invest in high-quality early childhood education can save\nmore than 7 dollars later on: by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen\npregnancy, even reducing violent crime. In States that make it a priority to\neducate our youngest children, like Georgia or Oklahoma, studies show\nstudents grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate\nhigh school, hold a job, form more stable families of their own. We know\nthis works. So let's do what works and make sure none of our children start\nthe race of life already behind. Let's give our kids that chance.\nLet's also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a\ngood job. Right now countries like Germany focus on graduating their high\nschool students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our\ncommunity colleges. So those German kids, they're ready for a job when\nthey graduate high school. They've been trained for the jobs that are there.\nNow at schools like P-TECH in Brooklyn, a collaboration between New York\nPublic Schools and City University of New York and IBM, students will\ngraduate with a high school diploma and an associate's degree in\ncomputers or engineering. We need to give every American student\nopportunities like this.\nAnd 4 years ago, we started Race to the Top, a competition that convinced\nalmost every State to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, all\nfor about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year. Tonight I'm\nannouncing a new challenge to redesign America's high schools so they\nbetter equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy. And we'll\nreward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers\nand create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering, and\nmath: the skills today's employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are\nthere right now and will be there in the future.\nNow, even with better high schools, most young people will need some\nhigher education. It's a simple fact: The more education you've got, the\nmore likely you are to have a good job and work your way into the middle\nclass. But today, skyrocketing costs price too many young people out of a\nhigher education or saddle them with unsustainable debt.\nThrough tax credits, grants, and better loans, we've made college more\naffordable for millions of students and families over the last few years. But\ntaxpayers can't keep on subsidizing higher and higher and higher costs for\nhigher education. Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and it's\nour job to make sure that they do.\nSo tonight I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act so that\naffordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive\ncertain types of Federal aid. And tomorrow my administration will release a\nnew college scorecard that parents and students can use to compare\nschools based on a simple criterion: where you can get the most bang for\nyour educational buck.\nNow, to grow our middle class, our citizens have to have access to the\neducation and training that today's jobs require. But we also have to make\nsure that America remains a place where everyone who's willing to work\u2014\neverybody who's willing to work hard\u2014has the chance to get ahead.\nOur economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of\nstriving, hopeful immigrants. And right now leaders from the business,\nlabor, law enforcement, faith communities, they all agree that the time has\ncome to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Now is the time to do it.\nNow is the time to get it done. [Applause] Now is the time to get it done.\nReal reform means stronger border security, and we can build on the\nprogress my administration has already made: putting more boots on the\nsouthern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal\ncrossings to their lowest levels in 40 years.\nReal reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned\ncitizenship, a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes\nand a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line\nbehind the folks trying to come here legally.\nAnd real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting\nperiods and attract the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will\nhelp create jobs and grow our economy.\n\nIn other words, we know what needs to be done. And as we speak,\nbipartisan groups in both Chambers are working diligently to draft a bill,\nand I applaud their efforts. So let's get this done. Send me a comprehensive\nimmigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away.\nAnd America will be better for it. Let's get it done. [Applause] Let's get it\ndone.\nBut we can't stop there. We know our economy is stronger when our wives,\nour mothers, our daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in\nthe workplace and free from the fear of domestic violence. Today the\nSenate passed the \"Violence Against Women's Act\" that Joe Biden originally\nwrote almost 20 years ago. And I now urge the House to do the same. Good\njob, Joe. And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living\nequal to their efforts, and finally pass the \"Paycheck Fairness Act\" this year.\nWe know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day's work\nwith honest wages. But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage\nearns $14,500 a year. Even with the tax relief we put in place, a family with\ntwo kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line.\nThat's wrong. That's why, since the last time this Congress raised the\nminimum wage, 19 States have chosen to bump theirs even higher.\nTonight let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who\nworks full-time should have to live in poverty and raise the Federal\nminimum wage to $9 an hour. We should be able to get that done.\nThis single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families. It\ncould mean the difference between groceries or the food bank, rent or\neviction, scraping by or finally getting ahead. For businesses across the\ncountry, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets. And a\nwhole lot of folks out there would probably need less help from\ngovernment. In fact, working folks shouldn't have to wait year after year for\nthe minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher. So\nhere's an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year:\nLet's tie the minimum wage to the cost of living so that it finally becomes a\nwage you can live on.\nTonight let's also recognize that there are communities in this country\nwhere no matter how hard you work, it is virtually impossible to get ahead:\nfactory towns decimated from years of plants packing up; inescapable\npockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are still fighting for\ntheir first job. America is not a place where the chance of birth or\ncircumstance should decide our destiny. And that's why we need to build\nnew ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to\nclimb them.\nLet's offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who've got what it\ntakes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so long that no one\nwill give them a chance anymore. Let's put people back to work rebuilding\nvacant homes in rundown neighborhoods. And this year, my administration\nwill begin to partner with 20 of the hardest hit towns in America to get\nthese communities back on their feet. Now, we'll work with local leaders to\ntarget resources at public safety and education and housing.\nWe'll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest. And we'll work\nto strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for\nlow-income couples and do more to encourage fatherhood, because what\nmakes you a man isn't the ability to conceive a child, it's having the courage\nto raise one. And we want to encourage that. We want to help that.\nStronger families. Stronger communities. A stronger America. It is this kind\nof prosperity\u2014broad, shared, built on a thriving middle class\u2014that has\nalways been the source of our progress at home. It's also the foundation of\nour power and influence throughout the world.\nTonight we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice\nevery day to protect us. Because of them, we can say with confidence that\nAmerica will complete its mission in Afghanistan and achieve our objective\nof defeating the core of Al Qaeda.\nAlready, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave service men and\nwomen. This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan\nsecurity forces take the lead. Tonight I can announce that over the next\nyear, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan.\nThis drawdown will continue, and by the end of next year, our war in\nAfghanistan will be over.\nBeyond 2014, America's commitment to a unified and sovereign\nAfghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change.\nWe're negotiating an agreement with the Afghan Government that focuses\non two missions: training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country\ndoes not again slip into chaos and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to\npursue the remnants of Al Qaeda and their affiliates.\nToday, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former\nself. It's true, different Al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have\nemerged, from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa. The threat these groups\npose is evolving. But to meet this threat, we don't need to send tens of\nthousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations.\nInstead, we'll need to help countries like Yemen and Libya and Somalia\nprovide for their own security and help allies who take the fight to\nterrorists, as we have in Mali. And where necessary, through a range of\ncapabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists\nwho pose the gravest threat to Americans.\nNow, as we do, we must enlist our values in the fight. That's why my\nadministration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy\nframework to guide our counterterrorism efforts. Throughout, we have kept\nCongress fully informed of our efforts. I recognize that in our democracy, no\none should just take my word for it that we're doing things the right way.\nSo, in the months ahead, I will continue to engage Congress to ensure not\nonly that our targeting, detention, and prosecution of terrorists remains\nconsistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our\nefforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world.\nOf course, our challenges don't end with Al Qaeda. America will continue to\nlead the effort to prevent the spread of the world's most dangerous\nweapons. The regime in North Korea must know they will only achieve\nsecurity and prosperity by meeting their international obligations.\nProvocations of the sort we saw last night will only further isolate them, as\nwe stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense, and lead the\nworld in taking firm action in response to these threats.\nLikewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a\ndiplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding that\nthey meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to prevent\nthem from getting a nuclear weapon.\n\nAt the same time, we'll engage Russia to seek further reductions in our\nnuclear arsenals and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear\nmaterials that could fall into the wrong hands, because our ability to\ninfluence others depends on our willingness to lead and meet our\nobligations.\nAmerica must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber attacks. Now,\nwe know hackers steal people's identities and infiltrate private e-mails. We\nknow foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets. Now\nour enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grids, our\nfinancial institutions, our air traffic control systems. We cannot look back\nyears from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats\nto our security and our economy.\nAnd that's why, earlier today, I signed a new Executive order that will\nstrengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing and\ndeveloping standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our\nprivacy.\nBut now Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give our\nGovernment a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks.\nThis is something we should be able to get done on a bipartisan basis.\nNow, even as we protect our people, we should remember that today's\nworld presents not just dangers, not just threats, it presents opportunities.\nTo boost American exports, support American jobs and level the playing\nfield in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on\na Trans-Pacific Partnership. And tonight I'm announcing that we will launch\ntalks on a comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership\nwith the European Union, because trade that is fair and free across the\nAtlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs.\nWe also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world\nenriches us all, not only because it creates new markets, more stable order\nin certain regions of the world, but also because it's the right thing to do. In\nmany places, people live on little more than a dollar a day. So the United\nStates will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next\ntwo decades by connecting more people to the global economy, by\nempowering women, by giving our young and brightest minds new\nopportunities to serve and helping communities to feed and power and\neducate themselves, by saving the world's children from preventable\ndeaths, and by realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation, which is\nwithin our reach.\nYou see, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during\nthis period of historic change. I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon,\nin Burma, when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into\nthe home where she had been imprisoned for years; when thousands of\nBurmese lined the streets, waving American flags, including a man who\nsaid: \"There is justice and law in the United States. I want our country to be\nlike that.\"\nIn defense of freedom, we'll remain the anchor of strong alliances from the\nAmericas to Africa, from Europe to Asia. In the Middle East, we will stand\nwith citizens as they demand their universal rights and support stable\ntransitions to democracy.\nWe know the process will be messy, and we cannot presume to dictate the\ncourse of change in countries like Egypt, but we can and will insist on\nrespect for the fundamental rights of all people. We'll keep the pressure on\na Syrian regime that has murdered its own people and support opposition\nleaders that respect the rights of every Syrian. And we will stand steadfast\nwith Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace.\nThese are the messages I'll deliver when I travel to the Middle East next\nmonth. And all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who\nserve in dangerous places at great personal risk: our diplomats, our\nintelligence officers, and the men and women of the United States Armed\nForces. As long as I'm Commander in Chief, we will do whatever we must to\nprotect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain the best\nmilitary the world has ever known.\nWe'll invest in new capabilities, even as we reduce waste and wartime\nspending. We will ensure equal treatment for all servicemembers and equal\nbenefits for their families, gay and straight. We will draw upon the courage\nand skills of our sisters and daughters and moms, because women have\nproven under fire that they are ready for combat.\n\nWe will keep faith with our veterans, investing in world-class care\u2014\nincluding mental health care\u2014for our wounded warriors, supporting our\nmilitary families, giving our veterans the benefits and education and job\nopportunities that they have earned. And I want to thank my wife Michelle\nand Dr. Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military\nfamilies as well as they have served us. Thank you, honey. Thank you, Jill.\nDefending our freedom, though, is not just the job of our military alone. We\nmust all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are protected here\nat home. That includes one of the most fundamental rights of a democracy:\nthe right to vote. Now, when any American, no matter where they live or\nwhat their party, are denied that right because they can't afford to wait for\n5 or 6 or 7 hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals.\nSo tonight I'm announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting\nexperience in America. And it definitely needs improvement. I'm asking two\nlong-time experts in the field\u2014who, by the way, recently served as the top\nattorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney's campaign\u2014to lead\nit. We can fix this, and we will. The American people demand it, and so does\nour democracy.\nOf course, what I've said tonight matters little if we don't come together to\nprotect our most precious resource: our children. It has been 2 months\nsince Newtown. I know this is not the first time this country has debated\nhow to reduce gun violence. But this time is different. Overwhelming\nmajorities of Americans\u2014Americans who believe in the Second\nAmendment\u2014have come together around commonsense reform, like\nbackground checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands\non a gun. Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws\nto prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals. Police chiefs\nare asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition\nmagazines off our streets, because these police chiefs, they're tired of\nseeing their guys and gals being outgunned.\nEach of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. Now, if you want to\nvote no, that's your choice. But these proposals deserve a vote. Because in\nthe 2 months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays,\ngraduations, anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from\na gun\u2014more than a thousand.\n\nOne of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton. She was 15\nyears old. She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss. She was a majorette. She\nwas so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best friend. Just 3\nweeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates, performing\nfor her country at my Inauguration. And a week later, she was shot and\nkilled in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house.\nHadiya's parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this Chamber tonight, along with\nmore than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun\nviolence. They deserve a vote. They deserve a vote. [Applause] They deserve\na vote. Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. The families of Newtown deserve a\nvote. The families of Aurora deserve a vote. The families of Oak Creek and\nTucson and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open\nby gun violence, they deserve a simple vote. They deserve a simple vote.\nOur actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country.\nIn fact, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will perfectly solve all\nthe challenges I've outlined tonight. But we were never sent here to be\nperfect. We were sent here to make what difference we can, to secure this\nNation, expand opportunity, uphold our ideals through the hard, often\nfrustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government.\nWe were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they\nlook out for one another, every single day, usually without fanfare, all\nacross this country. We should follow their example.\nWe should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu\nSanchez. When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, she\nwasn't thinking about how her own home was faring. Her mind was on the\n20 precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept\nthem all safe.\nWe should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline\nVictor. When Desiline arrived at her polling place, she was told the wait to\nvote might be 6 hours. And as time ticked by, her concern was not with her\ntired body or aching feet, but whether folks like her would get to have their\nsay. And hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in line to support her,\nbecause Desiline is 102 years old. And they erupted in cheers when she\nfinally put on a sticker that read, \"I voted.\" [Applause] There's Desiline.\n\nWe should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy.\nWhen a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and Brian was\nthe first to arrive\u2014and he did not consider his own safety. He fought back\nuntil help arrived and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the\nAmericans worshipping inside, even as he lay bleeding from 12 bullet\nwounds. And when asked how he did that, Brian said, \"That's just the way\nwe're made.\"\nThat's just the way we're made. We may do different jobs and wear\ndifferent uniforms and hold different views than the person beside us. But\nas Americans, we all share the same proud title: We are citizens. It's a word\nthat doesn't just describe our nationality or legal status. It describes the way\nwe're made. It describes what we believe. It captures the enduring idea that\nthis country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another\nand to future generations; that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of\nothers; and that well into our third century as a nation, it remains the task\nof us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next\ngreat chapter of our American story.\nThank you. God bless you, and God bless these United States of America.\n\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:15 p.m. in the House Chamber of the U.S.\nCapitol. In his remarks, he referred to Erskine B.

There's a strong belief in American exceptionalism and the idea that the nation's strength comes from its people's hard work, ingenuity, and commitment to core democratic ideals like opportunity, fairness, and justice. The speaker advocates for a \"smarter Government\" that invests in broad-based growth and protects fundamental rights, while also acknowledging the need for compromise and bipartisan solutions.\n\n**Scores, Evidence, and Confidence:**\n\n*   **Dignity:**\n    *   **Intensity:** 0.8\n    *   **Salience:** 0.8\n    *   **Evidence:**\n        *   \"the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like or who you love.\"\n        *   \"The American people don't expect government to solve every problem.

An entrepreneur flipped on\nthe lights in her tech startup and did her part to add to the more than 8\nmillion new jobs our businesses have created over the past 4 years. An\nautoworker fine-tuned some of the best, most fuel-efficient cars in the\nworld and did his part to help America wean itself off foreign oil.\nA farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest 5-year stretch of farm\nexports in our history. A rural doctor gave a young child the first\nprescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford. A man took the\nbus home from the graveyard shift, bone-tired, but dreaming big dreams\nfor his son. And in tight-knit communities all across America, fathers and\nmothers will tuck in their kids, put an arm around their spouse, remember\nfallen comrades, and give thanks for being home from a war that after 12\nlong years is finally coming to an end.\nAnd here are the results of your efforts: the lowest unemployment rate in\nover 5 years; a rebounding housing market; a manufacturing sector that's\nadding jobs for the first time since the 1990s; more oil produced at home\nthan we buy from the rest of the world, the first time that's happened in\nnearly 20 years; our deficits cut by more than half. And for the first time in\nover a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China\nis no longer the world's number-one place to invest, America is.\nThat's why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America. After 5\nyears of grit and determined effort, the United States is better positioned\nfor the 21st century than any other nation on Earth.\nThe question for everyone in this Chamber, running through every decision\nwe make this year, is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress.\nFor several years now, this town has been consumed by a rancorous\nargument over the proper size of the Federal Government. It's an important\ndebate, one that dates back to our very founding. But when that debate\nprevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our\ndemocracy\u2014when our differences shut down Government or threaten the\nfull faith and credit of the United States\u2014then we are not doing right by the\nAmerican people.\nNow, as President, I'm committed to making Washington work better and\nrebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here. And I believe most of\nyou are too. Last month, thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans,\nCongress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year's severe\ncuts to priorities like education. Nobody got everything they wanted, and\nwe can still do more to invest in this country's future while bringing down\nour deficit in a balanced way, but the budget compromise should leave us\nfreer to focus on creating new jobs, not creating new crises.\nAnd in the coming months, let's see where else we can make progress\ntogether. Let's make this a year of action. That's what most Americans want:\nfor all of us in this Chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their\naspirations. And what I believe unites the people of this Nation\u2014regardless\nof race or region or party, young or old, rich or poor\u2014is the simple,\nprofound belief in opportunity for all: the notion that if you work hard and\ntake responsibility, you can get ahead in America.\nNow, let's face it, that belief has suffered some serious blows. Over more\nthan three decades, even before the great recession hit, massive shifts in\ntechnology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good, middle-\nclass jobs and weakened the economic foundations that families depend\non.\nToday, after 4 years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices\nhave rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better. But\naverage wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward\nmobility has stalled. The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery,\ntoo many Americans are working more than ever just to get by, let alone to\nget ahead. And too many still aren't working at all.\nSo our job is to reverse these trends. It won't happen right away, and we\nwon't agree on everything. But what I offer tonight is a set of concrete,\npractical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and\nbuild new ladders of opportunity into the middle class. Some require\ncongressional action, and I am eager to work with all of you. But America\ndoes not stand still, and neither will I. So wherever and whenever I can take\nsteps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families,\nthat's what I'm going to do.\nAs usual, our First Lady sets a good example. [Applause ] Well\u2014[applause ].\nMichelle's \"Let's Move!\" partnership with schools, businesses, local leaders\nhas helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in 30 years.\nAnd that's an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care\ncosts for decades to come. The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill\nBiden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly\n400,000 veterans and military spouses.\nTaking a page from that playbook, the White House just organized a College\nOpportunity Summit, where already, 150 universities, businesses,\nnonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access\nto higher education and to help every hard-working kid go to college and\nsucceed when they get to campus. And across the country, we're partnering\nwith mayors, Governors, and State legislatures on issues from\nhomelessness to marriage equality.\nThe point is, there are millions of Americans outside of Washington who are\ntired of stale political arguments and are moving this country forward. They\nbelieve\u2014and I believe\u2014that here in America, our success should depend\nnot on accident of birth, but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of\nour dreams. That's what drew our forebears here. That's how the daughter\nof a factory worker is CEO of America's largest automaker; how the son of a\nbarkeeper is Speaker of the House; how the son of a single mom can be\nPresident of the greatest nation on Earth.\nOpportunity is who we are. And the defining project of our generation must\nbe to restore that promise. We know where to start: The best measure of\nopportunity is access to a good job. With the economy picking up speed,\ncompanies say they intend to hire more people this year. And over half of\nbig manufacturers say they're thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad.\nSo let's make that decision easier for more companies. Both Democrats and\nRepublicans have argued that our Tax Code is riddled with wasteful,\ncomplicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here and reward\ncompanies that keep profits abroad. Let's flip that equation. Let's work\ntogether to close those loopholes, and those incentives to ship jobs\noverseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at\nhome.\nMoreover, we can take the money we save from this transition to tax\nreform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging\nour commutes, because in today's global economy, first-class jobs gravitate\nto first-class infrastructure. We'll need Congress to protect more than 3\nmillion jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer.\nThat can happen. But I'll act on my own to slash bureaucracy and\nstreamline the permitting process for key projects so we can get more\nconstruction workers on the job as fast as possible.\nWe also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for\nthe next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs. My administration has\nlaunched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in Raleigh, North Carolina,\nand Youngstown, Ohio, where we've connected businesses to research\nuniversities that can help America lead the world in advanced technologies.\nTonight I'm announcing, we'll launch six more this year. Bipartisan bills in\nboth Houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they\ncreate. So get those bills to my desk. Put more Americans back to work.\nLet's do more to help the entrepreneurs and small-business owners who\ncreate most new jobs in America. Over the past 5 years, my administration\nhas made more loans to small-business owners than any other. And when\n98 percent of our exporters are small businesses, new trade partnerships\nwith Europe and Asia\u2014the Asia-Pacific will help them create more jobs. We\nneed to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to\nprotect our workers, protect our environment, and open new markets to\nnew goods stamped \"Made in the U.S.A.\"\nListen, China and Europe aren't standing on the sidelines, and neither\nshould we. We know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will\nown the global economy tomorrow. This is an edge America cannot\nsurrender. Federally funded research helped lead to the ideas and\ninventions behind Google and smartphones. And that's why Congress\nshould undo the damage done by last year's cuts to basic research so we\ncan unleash the next great American discovery. There are entire industries\nto be built based on vaccines that stay ahead of drug-resistant bacteria or\npaper-thin material that's stronger than steel. And let's pass a patent\nreform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not\ncostly and needless litigation.\nNow, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our\ncommitment to American energy. The all-of-the-above energy strategy I\nannounced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to\nenergy independence than we have been in decades.\nOne of the reasons why is natural gas. If extracted safely, it's the bridge fuel\nthat can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes\nclimate change. Businesses plan to invest almost $100 billion in new\nfactories that use natural gas. I'll cut red tape to help States get those\nfactories built and put folks to work, and this Congress can help by putting\npeople to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks\nfrom foreign oil to American natural gas.\nMeanwhile, my administration will keep working with the industry to\nsustain production and jobs growth while strengthening protection of our\nair, our water, our communities. And while we're at it, I'll use my authority\nto protect more of our pristine Federal lands for future generations.\nWell, it's not just oil and natural gas production that's booming, we're\nbecoming a global leader in solar too. Every 4 minutes, another American\nhome or business goes solar, every panel pounded into place by a worker\nwhose job cannot be outsourced. Let's continue that progress with a\nsmarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries\nthat don't need it so we can invest more in fuels of the future that do.\nAnd even as we've increased energy production, we've partnered with\nbusinesses, builders, and local communities to reduce the energy we\nconsume. When we rescued our automakers, for example, we worked with\nthem to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars. In the coming\nmonths, I'll build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks so\nwe can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump.\nAnd taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a\ncleaner, safer planet. Over the past 8 years, the United States has reduced\nour total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth. But we\nhave to act with more urgency, because a changing climate is already\nharming Western communities struggling with drought and coastal cities\ndealing with floods. That's why I directed my administration to work with\nStates, utilities, and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon\npollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air.\nThe shift to a cleaner energy economy won't happen overnight, and it will\nrequire some tough choices along the way. But the debate is settled.\nClimate change is a fact. And when our children's children look us in the eye\nand ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with\nnew sources of energy, I want us to be able to say, yes, we did.\nFinally, if we're serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of\nbusiness leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, law enforcement and fix our\nbroken immigration system. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have\nacted, and I know that members of both parties in the House want to do\nthe same. Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our\neconomy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two\ndecades. And for good reason: When people come here to fulfill their\ndreams\u2014to study, invent, contribute to our culture\u2014they make our country\na more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for\neverybody. So let's get immigration reform done this year. [Applause ] Let's\nget it done. It's time.\nThe ideas I've outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs.\nBut in this rapidly changing economy, we have to make sure that every\nAmerican has the skills to fill those jobs. The good news is, we know how to\ndo it.\nTwo years ago, as the auto industry came roaring back, Andra Rush opened\nup a manufacturing firm in Detroit. She knew that Ford needed parts for the\nbest-selling truck in America, and she knew how to make those parts. She\njust needed the workforce. So she dialed up what we call an American Job\nCenter, places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need\nto find a new job or a better job. She was flooded with new workers. And\ntoday, Detroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees. And\nwhat Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every\nemployer and every job seeker.\nSo tonight I've asked Vice President Biden to lead an across-the-board\nreform of America's training programs to make sure they have one mission:\ntrain Americans with the skills employers need and match them to good\njobs that need to be filled right now. That means more on-the-job training\nand more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory\nfor life. It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help\ndesign training to fill their specific needs. And if Congress wants to help, you\ncan concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready-to-\nwork Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs.\nI'm also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by\nreforming unemployment insurance so that it's more effective in today's\neconomy. But first, this Congress needs to restore the unemployment\ninsurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people.\nLet me tell you why. Misty DeMars is a mother of two young boys. She'd\nbeen steadily employed since she was a teenager, put herself through\ncollege. She'd never collected unemployment benefits, but she'd been\npaying taxes. In May, she and her husband used their life savings to buy\ntheir first home. A week later, budget cuts claimed the job she loved. Last\nmonth, when their unemployment insurance was cut off, she sat down and\nwrote me a letter, the kind I get every day. \"We are the face of the\nunemployment crisis,\" she wrote. \"I'm not dependent on the government.\nOur country depends on people like us who build careers, contribute to\nsociety, care about our neighbors. I'm confident that in time, I will find a job,\nI will pay my taxes, and we will raise our children in their own home in the\ncommunity we love. Please give us this chance.\"\nCongress, give these hard-working, responsible Americans that chance.\nGive them that chance. [Applause ] Give them the chance. They need our\nhelp right now. But more important, this country needs them in the game.\nThat's why I've been asking CEOs to give more long-term unemployed\nworkers a fair shot at new jobs, a new chance to support their families. And\nin fact, this week, many will come to the White House to make that\ncommitment real. Tonight I ask every business leader in America to join us\nand to do the same, because we are stronger when America fields a full\nteam.\nOf course, it's not enough to train today's workforce. We also have to\nprepare tomorrow's workforce, by guaranteeing every child access to a\nworld-class education. Estiven Rodriguez couldn't speak a word of English\nwhen he moved to New York City at age 9. But last month, thanks to the\nsupport of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program, he led a\nmarch of his classmates through a crowd of cheering parents and\nneighbors from their high school to the post office, where they mailed off\ntheir college applications. And this son of a factory worker just found out,\nhe's going to college this fall.\nFive years ago, we set out to change the odds for all our kids. We worked\nwith lenders to reform student loans, and today, more young people are\nearning college degrees than ever before. Race to the Top, with the help of\nGovernors from both parties, has helped States raise expectations and\nperformance. Teachers and principals in schools from Tennessee to\nWashington, DC, are making big strides in preparing students with the skills\nfor the new economy: problem solving, critical thinking, science, technology,\nengineering, math.\nNow, some of this change is hard. It requires everything from more\nchallenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for\nteachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think, not how well\nthey can fill in a bubble on a test. But it is worth it, and it is working. The\nproblem is, we're still not reaching enough kids, and we're not reaching\nthem in time. And that has to change.\nResearch shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child's\nlife is high-quality early education. Last year, I asked this Congress to help\nStates make high-quality pre-K available to every 4-year-old. And as a\nparent as well as a President, I repeat that request tonight. But in the\nmeantime, 30 States have raised pre-K funding on their own. They know we\ncan't wait. So just as we worked with States to reform our schools, this year,\nwe'll invest in new partnerships with States and communities across the\ncountry in a Race to the Top for our youngest children. And as Congress\ndecides what it's going to do, I'm going to pull together a coalition of elected\nofficials, business leaders, and philanthropists willing to help more kids\naccess the high-quality pre-K that they need. It is right for America. We need\nto get this done.\nLast year, I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-\nspeed broadband over the next 4 years. Tonight I can announce that with\nthe support of the FCC and companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sprint, and\nVerizon, we've got a down payment to start connecting more than 15,000\nschools and 20 million students over the next 2 years, without adding a\ndime to the deficit.\nWe're working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and\nemployers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training that\ncan lead directly to a job and career. We're shaking up our system of higher\neducation to give parents more information and colleges more incentive to\noffer better value so that no middle class kid is priced out of a college\neducation.\nWe're offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan\npayments to 10 percent of their income, and I want to work with Congress\nto see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student\nloan debt. And I'm reaching out to some of America's leading foundations\nand corporations on a new initiative to help more young men of color facing\nespecially tough odds to stay on track and reach their full potential.\nThe bottom line is, Michelle and I want every child to have the same chance\nthis country gave us. But we know our opportunity agenda won't be\ncomplete, and too many young people entering the workforce today will\nsee the American Dream as an empty promise, unless we also do more to\nmake sure our economy honors the dignity of work and hard work pays off\nfor every single American.\nToday, women make up about half of our workforce, but they still make 77\ncents for every dollar a man earns. That is wrong, and in 2014, it's an\nembarrassment. Women deserve equal pay for equal work. She deserves to\nhave a baby without sacrificing her job. A mother deserves a day off to care\nfor a sick child or a sick parent without running into hardship. And you\nknow what, a father does too. It is time to do away with workplace policies\nthat belong in a \"Mad Men\" episode. [Laughter] This year, let's all come\ntogether\u2014Congress, the White House, businesses from Wall Street to Main\nStreet\u2014to give every woman the opportunity she deserves. Because I\nbelieve when women succeed, America succeeds.\nNow, women hold a majority of lower wage jobs, but they're not the only\nones stifled by stagnant wages. Americans understand that some people\nwill earn more money than others, and we don't resent those who, by virtue\nof their efforts, achieve incredible success. That's what America is all about.\nBut Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full-time\nshould ever have to raise a family in poverty.\nIn the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage, five\nStates have passed laws to raise theirs. Many businesses have done it on\ntheir own. Nick Chute is here today with his boss, John Soranno. John's an\nowner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis, and Nick helps make the dough.\n[Laughter] Only now he makes more of it. [Laughter] John just gave his\nemployees a raise to 10 bucks an hour, and that's a decision that has eased\ntheir financial stress and boosted their morale.\nTonight I ask more of America's business leaders to follow John's lead: Do\nwhat you can to raise your employees' wages. It's good for the economy. It's\ngood for America. To every mayor, Governor, State legislator in America, I\nsay: You don't have to wait for Congress to act; Americans will support you\nif you take this on.\nAnd as a chief executive, I intend to lead by example. Profitable\ncorporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost\nproductivity and reduce turnover. We should too. In the coming weeks, I will\nissue an Executive order requiring Federal contractors to pay their federally\nfunded employees a fair wage of at least 10 dollars and 10 cents an hour.\nBecause if you cook our troops' meals or wash their dishes, you should not\nhave to live in poverty.\nOf course, to reach millions more, Congress does need to get on board.\nToday, the Federal minimum wage is worth about 20 percent less than it\nwas when Ronald Reagan first stood here. And Tom Harkin and George\nMiller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to 10 dollars and 10\ncents. It's easy to remember: 10-10. This will help families. It will give\nbusinesses customers with more money to spend. It does not involve any\nnew bureaucratic program. So join the rest of the country. Say yes. Give\nAmerica a raise. Give them a raise.\nThere are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and\nfew are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull\nthemselves up through hard work than the earned-income tax credit. Right\nnow it helps about half of all parents at some point. Think about that: It\nhelps about half of all parents in America at some point in their lives. But I\nagree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn't do enough for\nsingle workers who don't have kids. So let's work together to strengthen the\ncredit, reward work, help more Americans get ahead.\nLet's do more to help Americans save for retirement. Today, most workers\ndon't have a pension. A Social Security check often isn't enough on its own.\nAnd while the stock market has doubled over the last 5 years, that doesn't\nhelp folks who don't have 401(k)s. That's why, tomorrow, I will direct the\nTreasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own\nretirement savings: MyRA.\nIt's a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg. MyRA\nguarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in. And if this\nCongress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down Tax Code that\ngives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does little or nothing for\nmiddle class Americans. Offer every American access to an automatic IRA\non the job so they can save at work just like everybody in this Chamber can.\nAnd since the most important investment many families make is their\nhome, send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a\nhousing crisis ever again and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for\nfuture generations.\nOne last point on financial security: For decades, few things exposed hard-\nworking families to economic hardship more than a broken health care\nsystem. And in case you haven't heard, we're in the process of fixing that.\nNow, a preexisting condition used to mean that someone like Amanda\nShelley, a physician's assistant and single mom from Arizona, couldn't get\nhealth insurance. But on January 1, she got covered. On January 3, she felt a\nsharp pain. On January 6, she had emergency surgery. Just one week earlier,\nAmanda said, and that surgery would have meant bankruptcy.\nThat's what health insurance reform is all about: the peace of mind that if\nmisfortune strikes, you don't have to lose everything. Already, because of\nthe Affordable Care Act, more than 3 million Americans under age 26 have\ngained coverage under their parent's plan. More than 9 million Americans\nhave signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage. Nine\nmillion.\nAnd here's another number: zero. Because of this law, no American\u2014none,\nzero\u2014can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting\ncondition like asthma or back pain or cancer. No woman can ever be\ncharged more just because she's a woman. And we did all this while adding\nyears to Medicare's finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat, and lowering\nprescription costs for millions of seniors.\nNow, I do not expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of\nthis law. [Laughter] But I know that the American people are not interested\nin refighting old battles. So again, if you have specific plans to cut costs,\ncover more people, increase choice, tell America what you'd do differently.\nLet's see if the numbers add up. But let's not have another 40-something\nvotes to repeal a law that's already helping millions of Americans like\nAmanda. The first 40 were plenty. [Laughter]\nWe all owe it to the American people to say what we're for, not just what\nwe're against. And if you want to know the real impact this law is having,\njust talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who's here tonight. Now,\nKentucky is not the most liberal part of the country. That's not where I got\nmy highest vote totals. [Laughter] But he's like a man possessed when it\ncomes to covering his Commonwealth's families. They're our neighbors and\nour friends, he said: \"They're people we shop and go to church with,\nfarmers out on the tractor, grocery clerks. They're people who go to work\nevery morning praying they don't get sick. No one deserves to live that\nway.\"\nSteve's right. That's why tonight I ask every American who knows someone\nwithout health insurance to help them get covered by March 31. [Applause ]\nHelp them get covered. Moms, get on your kids to sign up. Kids, call your\nmom and walk her through the application. It will give her some peace of\nmind, and plus, she'll appreciate hearing from you. [Laughter]\nAfter all, that's the spirit that has always moved this Nation forward. It's the\nspirit of citizenship, the recognition that through hard work and\nresponsibility, we can pursue our individual dreams, but still come together\nas one American family to make sure the next generation can pursue its\ndreams as well.\nCitizenship means standing up for everyone's right to vote. Last year, part\nof the Voting Rights Act was weakened, but conservative Republicans and\nliberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it. And the bipartisan\nCommission I appointed, chaired by my campaign lawyer and Governor\nRomney's campaign lawyer, came together and have offered reforms so\nthat no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote. Let's support these\nefforts. It should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank\naccounts, that drives our democracy.\nCitizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us\neach day. I've seen the courage of parents, students, pastors, police officers\nall over this country who say, \"We are not afraid.\" And I intend to keep\ntrying, with or without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting\ninnocent Americans in our movie theaters, in our shopping malls, or\nschools like Sandy Hook.\nCitizenship demands a sense of common purpose, participation in the hard\nwork of self-government, an obligation to serve our communities. And I\nknow this Chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country\nthan our diplomats and the men and women of the United States Armed\nForces. Thank you. Tonight, because of the extraordinary troops and\ncivilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free, the United States\nis more secure. When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving\nin Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, all our troops are out of Iraq. More than\n60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan. With\nAfghan forces now in the lead for their own security, our troops have\nmoved to a support role. Together with our allies, we will complete our\nmission there by the end of this year, and America's longest war will finally\nbe over.\nAfter 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility\nfor its own future. If the Afghan Government signs a security agreement\nthat we have negotiated, a small force of Americans could remain in\nAfghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions: training and\nassisting Afghan forces and counterterrorism operations to pursue any\nremnants of Al Qaeda. For while our relationship with Afghanistan will\nchange, one thing will not: our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks\nagainst our country.\nThe fact is, that danger remains. While we've put Al Qaeda's core leadership\non a path to defeat, the threat has evolved as Al Qaeda affiliates and other\nextremists take root in different parts of the world. In Yemen, Somalia, Iraq,\nMali, we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable those\nnetworks. In Syria, we'll support the opposition that rejects the agenda of\nterrorist networks. Here at home, we'll keep strengthening our defenses\nand combat new threats like cyber attacks. And as we reform our defense\nbudget, we will have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform and\ninvest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions.\nWe have to remain vigilant. But I strongly believe our leadership and our\nsecurity cannot depend on our outstanding military alone. As Commander\nin Chief, I have used force when needed to protect the American people,\nand I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office. But I will not\nsend our troops into harm's way unless it is truly necessary, nor will I allow\nour sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts. We must fight\nthe battles that need to be fought, not those that terrorists prefer from us:\nlarge-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed\nextremism.\nSo even as we actively and aggressively pursue terrorist networks through\nmore targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners,\nAmerica must move off a permanent war footing. That's why I've imposed\nprudent limits on the use of drones. For we will not be safer if people\nabroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the\nconsequences.\nThat's why, working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance\nprograms, because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on\npublic confidence, here and abroad, that privacy of ordinary people is not\nbeing violated.\nAnd with the Afghan war ending, this needs to be the year Congress lifts the\nremaining restrictions on detained transfers and we close the prison at\nGuantanamo Bay. Because we counter terrorism not just through\nintelligence and military actions, but by remaining true to our constitutional\nideals and setting an example for the rest of the world.\nYou see, in a world of complex threats, our security, our leadership,\ndepends on all elements of our power, including strong and principled\ndiplomacy. American diplomacy has rallied more than 50 countries to\nprevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands and allowed us\nto reduce our own reliance on cold war stockpiles. American diplomacy,\nbacked by the threat of force, is why Syria's chemical weapons are being\neliminated.\nAnd we will continue to work with the international community to usher in\nthe future the Syrian people deserve, a future free of dictatorship, terror,\nand fear. As we speak, American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and\nPalestinians as they engage in the difficult but necessary talks to end the\nconflict there, to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians\nand lasting peace and security for the State of Israel, a Jewish state that\nknows America will always be at their side.\nAnd it is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the\nprogress of Iran's nuclear program and rolled back parts of that program\nfor the very first time in a decade. As we gather here tonight, Iran has\nbegun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium. It's not\ninstalling advanced centrifuges. Unprecedented inspections help the world\nverify every day that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb. And with our allies\nand partners, we're engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully\nachieve a goal we all share: preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear\nweapon.\nThese negotiations will be difficult. They may not succeed. We are clear-\neyed about Iran's support for terrorist organizations like Hizballah, which\nthreatens our allies. And we're clear about the mistrust between our\nnations, mistrust that cannot be wished away. But these negotiations don't\nrely on trust. Any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable\naction that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not\nbuilding a nuclear bomb. If John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could\nnegotiate with the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident America\ncan negotiate with less powerful adversaries today.\nThe sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible.\nBut let me be clear: If this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that\nthreatens to derail these talks, I will veto it. For the sake of our national\nsecurity, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed. If Iran's leaders do\nnot seize this opportunity, then I will be the first to call for more sanctions\nand stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a\nnuclear weapon. But if Iran's leaders do seize the chance\u2014and we'll know\nsoon enough\u2014then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the\ncommunity of nations, and we will have resolved one of the leading security\nchallenges of our time without the risks of war.\nNow, finally, let's remember that our leadership is defined not just by our\ndefense against threats, but by the enormous opportunities to do good and\npromote understanding around the globe: to forge greater cooperation, to\nexpand new markets, to free people from fear and want. And no one is\nbetter positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America.\nOur alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known.\nFrom Tunisia to Burma, we're supporting those who are willing to do the\nhard work of building democracy. In Ukraine, we stand for the principle that\nall people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully and to\nhave a say in their country's future. Across Africa, we're bringing together\nbusinesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end\nextreme poverty. In the Americas, we're building new ties of commerce, but\nwe're also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young\npeople. And we will continue to focus on the Asia-Pacific, where we support\nour allies, shape a future of greater security and prosperity, and extend a\nhand to those devastated by disaster, as we did in the Philippines, when our\nMarines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and who\nwere greeted with words like, \"We will never forget your kindness\" and\n\"God bless America.\"\nWe do these things because they help promote our long-term security, and\nwe do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every\nhuman being, regardless of race or religion, creed or sexual orientation.\nAnd next week, the world will see one expression of that commitment,\nwhen Team U.S.A. marches the red, white, and blue into the Olympic\nStadium and brings home the gold. [Laughter]\nAudience members: U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President: My fellow Americans, no other country in the world does what\nwe do. On every issue, the world turns to us, not simply because of the size\nof our economy or our military might, but because of the ideals we stand\nfor and the burdens we bear to advance them. No one knows this better\nthan those who serve in uniform.\nAs this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes returns to\ncivilian life. We'll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the\nbenefits they've earned and our wounded warriors receive the health care\u2014\nincluding the mental health care\u2014that they need. We'll keep working to\nhelp all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at\nhome. And we will all continue to join forces to honor and support our\nremarkable military families.\nLet me tell you about one of those families I've come to know. I first met\nCory Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha Beach on the 65th\nanniversary of D-day. Along with some of his fellow Rangers, he walked me\nthrough the program and the ceremony. He was a strong, impressive young\nman, had an easy manner, he was sharp as a tack. And we joked around\nand took pictures, and I told him to stay in touch.\nA few months later, on his 10th deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a\nmassive roadside bomb in Afghanistan. His comrades found him in a canal,\nface down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain. For months, he lay in a coma.\nAnd the next time I met him, in the hospital, he couldn't speak, could barely\nmove. Over the years, he's endured dozens of surgeries and procedures,\nhours of grueling rehab every day.\nEven now, Cory is still blind in one eye, still struggles on his left side. But\nslowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig and the\ncommunity around him, Cory has grown stronger. And day by day, he's\nlearned to speak again and stand again and walk again. And he's working\ntoward the day when he can serve his country again. \"My recovery has not\nbeen easy,\" he says. \"Nothing in life that's worth anything is easy.\" Cory is\nhere tonight. And like the Army he loves, like the America he serves,\nSergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit.\nCory.\nMy fellow Americans, men and women like Cory remind us that America has\nnever come easy. Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy.\nSometimes, we stumble, we make mistakes; we get frustrated or\ndiscouraged. But for more than 200 years, we have put those things aside\nand placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress: to create and\nbuild and expand the possibilities of individual achievement, to free other\nnations from tyranny and fear, to promote justice and fairness and equality\nunder the law so that the words set to paper by our Founders are made\nreal for every citizen. The America we want for our kids\u2014a rising America\nwhere honest work is plentiful and communities are strong, where\nprosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our\ndreams and toil will take us\u2014none of it is easy. But if we work together\u2014if\nwe summon what is best in us, the way Cory summoned what is best in him\n\u2014with our feet planted firmly in today, but our eyes cast toward tomorrow,\nI know it is within our reach. Believe it.\nGod bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\n\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:15 p.m. in the House Chamber of the U.S.\nCapitol. In his remarks, he referred to Jill T.

The standard deviation calculation for CSC was thorough, including mean, squared differences, sum of squared differences, variance, and finally the standard deviation. Salience-weighted cluster scores were calculated by summing the product of each dimension's salience and intensity, then dividing by the sum of salience scores for that cluster. Character tension scores correctly applied the `min` function and absolute difference of salience. The MC-SCI was a straightforward average of the tension scores. All numerical results are presented with appropriate precision (typically 4 decimal places for intermediate calculations and 2-3 for final scores as per common practice for such indices).\n\n**Confidence Assessment for Numerical Results:**\n\n*   **Character Tension Scores:** 0.9 (Calculations are direct applications of the formula based on input scores.)\n*   **Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index (MC-SCI):** 0.95 (Direct average, highly reliable.)\n*   **Character Salience Concentration (CSC):** 0.95 (Standard deviation calculation is robust.)\n*   **Virtue/Vice Cluster Scores:** 0.95 (Salience-weighted average, reliable given input scores.)\n*   **Character Balance, Intensity, Moral Clarity:** 0.95 (Direct calculations from cluster scores, highly reliable.)\n\n**Mathematical Concerns or Limitations Identified:**\n\n1.  **Identical Documents:** Documents 1 and 2 are identical in content. This means their analyses and numerical results are also identical. While I processed them as distinct documents as per instructions, this redundancy might indicate an issue with the batch input rather than my analysis. The mathematical results are consistent with the identical input.\n2.  **Subjectivity of Initial Scores:** The initial intensity and salience scores (0.0-1.0) are qualitative assessments based on textual interpretation. While I strove for consistency and provided evidence, these are inherently subjective and form the foundation for all subsequent quantitative analysis. The confidence ratings provided for these initial scores reflect the clarity and consistency of the evidence found in the text.\n3.  **Interpretation of Tension Formula:** The formula `min(Virtue_score, Vice_score) * |Virtue_salience - Vice_salience|` implies that tension is highest when both opposing traits are present (min score > 0) AND their salience differs significantly. If salience is equal, tension is zero, regardless of intensity. This mathematical definition of \"tension\" is specific to this framework and might not align with all intuitive understandings of moral tension, but it was applied as specified.\n4.  **Small Sample Size for Standard Deviation:** Calculating standard deviation on only 10 data points (salience scores) provides a measure of dispersion within this specific set, but its generalizability as a \"concentration\" metric might be limited in broader statistical contexts. However, for the purpose of this framework, it serves its defined role.\n\nOverall, the mathematical operations were executed precisely as instructed by the framework. The accuracy of the numerical results is high, given the input scores.\n\n---\n---\n### **ANALYSIS RESULTS**\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"worldview\": \"The speaker's worldview is rooted in a progressive civic republicanism, emphasizing collective action, shared responsibility, and the pursuit of a more perfect union.
