    "analysis_summary": "This analysis of President Joe Biden's 2021 Inaugural Address reveals a speaker whose moral character is primarily focused on fostering unity and overcoming division. The speech strongly emphasizes civic virtues such as Hope, Dignity, and Truth, while explicitly rejecting vices like Tribalism and Fear. The analysis indicates a 'Moral Coherence' in the speaker's character, suggesting a consistent moral identity with minimal strategic contradictions. The character is assessed as 'Distributed,' meaning the speaker engages broadly across various moral dimensions rather than focusing intensely on a narrow set of priorities.",

He advocates for a rejection of division, fear, and manipulation, promoting a forward-looking, pragmatic approach to governance and societal healing.",
