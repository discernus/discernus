### 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of 12 campaign speeches by Jair Bolsonaro during the 2018 Brazilian presidential election, utilizing the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2. The primary objective of this exploratory study (N=12) was to replicate and extend prior research by quantifying the prevalence, characteristics, and temporal evolution of populist rhetoric. The central finding from the statistical analysis is that Bolsonaro's discourse was characterized by a **consistently high and stable level of populism**, rather than a strategic intensification as the election approached. The mean Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index across all speeches was 0.81, a value indicating a pervasive and rhetorically central populist style.

The analysis refutes several key hypotheses from the experimental design. Contrary to the populist intensification hypothesis (H₂), linear trend analysis revealed a slight but non-significant negative slope in overall populism over time (β = -0.015, *p* = .089). This suggests that Bolsonaro's populist platform was a foundational element of his communication from the outset, not a tactic deployed with increasing frequency under electoral pressure. Furthermore, the data challenges the theoretical assumption of an oppositional relationship between nationalism and populism (H₃). A statistically significant positive correlation was found between `nationalist_exclusion` and `popular_sovereignty_claims` (*r* = .627, *p* = .029), indicating these rhetorical modes were synergistic and mutually reinforcing in his speeches.

Methodologically, the analysis provides critical insights into the PDAF's performance. While the framework successfully identified a strong populist signal and profiled its dimensional characteristics—with `manichaean_people_elite_framing` and `anti_pluralist_exclusion` being most salient—it also revealed a significant structural weakness in this context. The internal consistency of the framework's "Primary Populist Core Anchors" was poor (Cronbach's α = .211), suggesting that these dimensions did not function as a cohesive, unified construct in Bolsonaro's discourse but rather as a collection of distinct rhetorical tools. Due to the small sample size (N=12), all findings should be considered preliminary and indicative, highlighting the need for further research with a larger corpus to validate these patterns.

### 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Populism as a Stable Baseline, Not a Dynamic Tactic**: The data indicates that Bolsonaro's rhetoric was intensely populist throughout the campaign (Mean Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index = 0.81). However, it did not intensify over time; linear regression showed a non-significant negative trend (*p* = .089), contradicting the hypothesis that populist appeals would increase closer to the election. This suggests populism was a core, stable feature of his communicative identity.
*   **Nationalism and Populism as Synergistic Forces**: The analysis falsified the hypothesis (H₃) that nationalist framing would negatively correlate with people-centric populism. Instead, a significant positive correlation was observed between `nationalist_exclusion` and `popular_sovereignty_claims` (*r* = .627, *p* = .029). This suggests that for Bolsonaro, defining the nation through exclusion and appealing to the direct will of the people were complementary, not competing, strategies.
*   **A Distinct Rhetorical Profile Dominated by Antagonism and Exclusion**: The framework identified a clear populist signature. The most rhetorically prominent dimensions were `manichaean_people_elite_framing` (Mean Salience = 0.88) and `anti_pluralist_exclusion` (Mean Salience = 0.86). This highlights a style centered on constructing a moral struggle between the "people" and "elites" and delegitimizing political opposition.
*   **Low Strategic Contradiction Suggests Rhetorical Coherence**: The Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI), designed to measure the use of contradictory appeals, remained low and stable throughout the campaign (Mean = 0.11). This finding suggests that Bolsonaro's messaging was more rhetorically coherent than strategically contradictory, focusing on a consistent set of themes rather than balancing opposing messages for different audiences.
*   **Assassination Attempt Did Not Significantly Alter Populist Rhetoric**: Contrary to hypotheses that the September 6th stabbing would amplify victimhood narratives (H₄, H₈), there was no statistically significant increase in the `manichaean_people_elite_framing` or `elite_conspiracy` dimensions post-incident. This indicates a high degree of resilience in his established rhetorical structure, which did not fundamentally shift even in response to a major crisis.
*   **Methodological Challenge to Framework's Internal Structure**: A critical finding for the PDAF framework itself is the poor internal consistency of its four "core" dimensions (Cronbach's α = .211). This low reliability score suggests that in this specific corpus, the dimensions of Manichaean framing, crisis narrative, popular sovereignty, and anti-pluralism did not measure a single underlying construct. They may be better understood as an inventory of related but independent rhetorical strategies.

### 4. Methodology

This study employed a quantitative textual analysis approach to examine the populist rhetoric in a corpus of 12 speeches delivered by Jair Bolsonaro during his 2018 presidential campaign. The analysis was conducted using the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2, a computational tool designed for nuanced measurement of populist communication.

#### Framework Description

The PDAF is a multi-dimensional analytical instrument grounded in the ideational approach to populism. It moves beyond binary classification to quantify populist discourse across nine core dimensions, grouped into three theoretical categories:
1.  **Primary Populist Core Anchors**: `manichaean_people_elite_framing`, `crisis_restoration_narrative`, `popular_sovereignty_claims`, `anti_pluralist_exclusion`.
2.  **Populist Mechanism Anchors**: `elite_conspiracy/systemic_corruption`, `authenticity_vs_political_class`, `homogeneous_people_construction`.
3.  **Boundary Distinction Anchors**: `nationalist_exclusion`, `economic_populist_appeals`.

A key innovation of the PDAF is its use of **salience-weighting**, which measures the rhetorical prominence of each dimension (0.0-1.0) in addition to its intensity (raw_score, 0.0-1.0). This allows for the calculation of derived metrics like the `salience_weighted_overall_populism_index`, which reflects both the presence and the strategic emphasis of populist themes. The framework also calculates a `populist_strategic_contradiction_index` (PSCI) to quantify the use of seemingly contradictory rhetorical appeals.

#### Data and Corpus

The corpus consists of 12 formal political speeches by Jair Bolsonaro, spanning from his candidacy launch on July 22, 2018, to a pre-second-round address on October 27, 2018. The documents were selected to provide temporal coverage across key campaign phases, including pre- and post-the September 6th assassination attempt. Metadata for each speech, including date, audience type, and campaign stage, were used for subgroup analyses.

#### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

The statistical analysis was designed to test 14 hypotheses derived from the experiment's research questions. The methods included:
*   **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculation of means, standard deviations, and ranges for all dimensional scores and derived metrics.
*   **Hypothesis Testing**: A series of t-tests were planned to compare means between groups (e.g., pre- vs. post-stabbing, audience types).
*   **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson's correlation coefficient (*r*) was used to assess relationships between PDAF dimensions.
*   **Trend Analysis**: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression was performed to model the change in the `salience_weighted_overall_populism_index` over time.
*   **Internal Consistency**: Cronbach's alpha (α) was calculated to assess the reliability of the "Primary Populist Core Anchors" as a unified scale.

**Analytical Limitations**: The most significant limitation of this study is the small sample size (N=12). This severely restricts the statistical power of inferential tests and means that any non-significant findings may be due to a Type II error (i.e., failing to detect a real effect). Group comparisons, particularly those involving subgroups with very few documents (e.g., `audience` = "business_leaders", n=1), are statistically unsound. Consequently, all findings are presented as **exploratory and suggestive rather than conclusive**. The analysis prioritizes descriptive statistics, pattern recognition, and the magnitude of observed effects over the statistical significance of p-values.

### 5. Comprehensive Results

#### 5.1 Hypothesis Evaluation

A total of 14 hypotheses were specified in the experiment configuration. Each was tested against the statistical data. Due to the exploratory nature of this study (N=12), outcomes are reported with the explicit caveat that statistical power is limited.

*   **H₁ (Overall Populism ≥ 0.5)**: **CONFIRMED**. The mean `salience_weighted_overall_populism_index` across the 12 speeches was 0.81, substantially exceeding the 0.5 threshold for a "somewhat populist" classification. This result provides strong quantitative support for characterizing Bolsonaro's 2018 campaign discourse as highly populist.

*   **H₂ (μ_late_campaign > μ_early_campaign)**: **INDETERMINATE**. A direct t-test was statistically inappropriate due to the "early_campaign" group containing only one speech (n=1). A descriptive comparison showed the mean for the single early speech (0.85) was slightly higher than the mean for the seven speeches in the late period (0.82). This does not support the intensification hypothesis.

*   **H₃ (Patriotic/nationalist framing will show negative correlation with people-centric populist dimensions)**: **FALSIFIED**. The data shows the opposite of the hypothesized relationship. The correlation between `nationalist_exclusion` and `popular_sovereignty_claims` was positive and statistically significant (*r*(10) = .627, *p* = .029). Correlations with other people-centric dimensions were also positive, though not significant. This suggests a synergistic, not antagonistic, relationship.

*   **H₄ (μ_post_stabbing > μ_pre_stabbing on Manichaean People-Elite Framing)**: **FALSIFIED**. An independent samples t-test found no significant difference in `manichaean_people_elite_framing` scores before (M = 0.88, SD = 0.02) and after (M = 0.86, SD = 0.04) the stabbing incident; *t*(9) = 0.35, *p* = .732. The observed effect was negligible and in the opposite direction of the hypothesis.

*   **H₅ (Anti-Pluralist Exclusion and Crisis-Restoration dimensions will show highest salience scores > 0.7)**: **CONFIRMED**. Both specified dimensions exhibited high mean salience scores: `anti_pluralist_exclusion` (M = 0.86) and `crisis_restoration_narrative` (M = 0.80). The hypothesis was not only confirmed but understated the reality, as four other dimensions also surpassed the 0.7 salience threshold: `manichaean_people_elite_framing` (M = 0.88), `homogeneous_people_construction` (M = 0.82), `authenticity_vs_political_class` (M = 0.75), and `elite_conspiracy/systemic_corruption` (M = 0.71).

*   **H₆ (Business audience speeches will score lower on Economic Populist Appeals)**: **INDETERMINATE**. This hypothesis could not be reliably tested as the "business_leaders" audience group contained only one speech (n=1). Descriptively, the raw score for this single speech (0.85) was higher than the mean for "mass_public" speeches (M = 0.78), contradicting the hypothesis, but this comparison is not statistically valid.

*   **H₇ (Populist Strategic Contradiction Index will be highest in October speeches)**: **FALSIFIED**. An independent samples t-test revealed no significant difference in the `populist_strategic_contradiction_index` between October speeches (M = 0.12, SD = 0.03) and pre-October speeches (M = 0.11, SD = 0.05); *t*(9) = 0.64, *p* = .540. There is no evidence of increased strategic contradiction under final campaign pressure.

*   **H₈ (Elite Conspiracy dimension will show significant increase after stabbing incident)**: **FALSIFIED**. An independent samples t-test showed no significant change in `elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption` scores before (M = 0.78, SD = 0.09) and after (M = 0.77, SD = 0.13) the stabbing; *t*(10) = 0.14, *p* = .891. The data does not support the hypothesis of a heightened victimization narrative through this dimension.

*   **H₉ (Linear trend analysis will show significant positive slope for overall populism)**: **FALSIFIED**. OLS regression of the `salience_weighted_overall_populism_index` on a temporal index of the speeches yielded a non-significant negative coefficient (β = -0.015, *p* = .089). The model explained very little variance (R² = .034). This result directly contradicts the populist intensification hypothesis.

*   **H₁₀ (Variance in populist scores will increase in final campaign month)**: **FALSIFIED**. Levene's test for equality of variances found no significant difference in the variance of populism scores between October speeches and earlier speeches (F(1, 10) = 0.65, *p* = .441).

*   **H₁₁ (At least 5 of 9 PDAF dimensions will show significant differences between campaign_stage groups)**: **INDETERMINATE**. A formal ANOVA could not be meaningfully conducted due to the small and uneven sample sizes across the eight `campaign_stage` groups (some with n=1). This hypothesis cannot be confirmed or falsified with the current data.

*   **H₁₂ (Core populist dimensions will show higher internal consistency (Cronbach's α > 0.8))**: **FALSIFIED**. The calculated Cronbach's alpha for the four core dimensions (`manichaean_people_elite_framing`, `crisis_restoration_narrative`, `popular_sovereignty_claims`, `anti_pluralist_exclusion`) was α = .211. This indicates poor internal consistency, far below the 0.8 threshold, and challenges the assumption that they measure a single latent construct in this corpus.

*   **H₁₃ (Nationalist Exclusion will correlate positively with Anti-Pluralist Exclusion (r > 0.5))**: **FALSIFIED**. The Pearson correlation between the raw scores of `nationalist_exclusion` and `anti_pluralist_exclusion` was weak and not statistically significant (*r*(10) = .137, *p* = .671), failing to meet the hypothesized strength of association.

*   **H₁₄ (Economic Populist Appeals will show lowest salience in business/policy speeches (< 0.3))**: **INDETERMINATE**. This could not be tested reliably due to the n=1 sample size for the business/policy speech. The salience score for that single speech was 0.65, which is not lower than the mean for other speeches (M = 0.69) and is well above the < 0.3 threshold.

#### 5.2 Descriptive Statistics

The analysis reveals a consistently high level of populist rhetoric across the corpus. The mean `salience_weighted_overall_populism_index` was 0.81 (SD = 0.04), with a narrow range from 0.71 to 0.86, indicating that every speech analyzed was strongly populist.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key Derived Metrics (N=12)**
| Metric                                       | Mean  | SD    | Median | Min   | Max   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index     | 0.814 | 0.040 | 0.816  | 0.713 | 0.858 |
| Salience-Weighted Core Populism Index        | 0.835 | 0.040 | 0.840  | 0.741 | 0.882 |
| Salience-Weighted Populism Mechanisms Index  | 0.787 | 0.061 | 0.792  | 0.667 | 0.867 |
| Salience-Weighted Boundary Distinctions Index| 0.744 | 0.128 | 0.750  | 0.400 | 0.900 |
| Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)| 0.105 | 0.041 | 0.099  | 0.043 | 0.152 |

The dimensional analysis in Table 2 shows which specific populist themes were most prominent. `manichaean_people_elite_framing` and `anti_pluralist_exclusion` had the highest mean raw scores and salience, defining the core of the rhetorical approach. In contrast, `economic_populist_appeals` had the lowest mean salience, suggesting it was a less central theme compared to cultural and anti-establishment messages.

| Dimension                               | Mean Raw Score | Mean Salience |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| `manichaean_people_elite_framing`       | 0.888          | 0.879         |
| `anti_pluralist_exclusion`              | 0.854          | 0.858         |
| `homogeneous_people_construction`       | 0.846          | 0.817         |
| `crisis_restoration_narrative`          | 0.829          | 0.795         |
| `authenticity_vs_political_class`       | 0.771          | 0.746         |
| `elite_conspiracy/systemic_corruption`  | 0.779          | 0.712         |
| `nationalist_exclusion`                 | 0.725          | 0.704         |
| `popular_sovereignty_claims`            | 0.700          | 0.642         |
| `economic_populist_appeals`             | 0.604          | 0.567         |

#### 5.3 Advanced Metric Analysis

The PDAF's advanced metrics provide insight into the strategic structure of the discourse. The `populist_strategic_contradiction_index` (PSCI) measures the extent to which a speaker deploys rhetorically contradictory themes (e.g., calling for direct democracy while simultaneously rejecting pluralism). The mean PSCI across the corpus was low (M = 0.11), and as noted in the falsification of H₇, it did not increase over time. This low score suggests a relatively coherent rhetorical strategy. Rather than balancing contradictory messages, the discourse appears to have maintained a consistent and non-contradictory set of populist appeals, reinforcing a stable ideological position.

#### 5.4 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The analysis of inter-dimensional relationships revealed several theoretically significant patterns. The most striking finding was the **positive and significant correlation between `nationalist_exclusion` and `popular_sovereignty_claims`** (*r* = .627, *p* = .029). This contradicts the hypothesis (H₃) of a trade-off and suggests that, in Bolsonaro's rhetoric, the construction of an exclusionary national identity was directly and positively linked to appeals for the unmediated will of the people. This indicates a fusion of nationalist and populist logics.

A critical finding regarding the framework's structure is the **poor internal consistency of the Primary Populist Core Anchors**. With a Cronbach's alpha of α = .211, these four dimensions (`manichaean_people_elite_framing`, `crisis_restoration_narrative`, `popular_sovereignty_claims`, `anti_pluralist_exclusion`) do not form a reliable scale in this dataset. This suggests they did not function as facets of a single underlying "populism" construct. Instead, the data indicates they were deployed as independent rhetorical tools, challenging the theoretical coherence of this core grouping within the PDAF for this specific political context.

#### 5.5 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The dominant pattern emerging from the data is one of **high-intensity, stable populism**. The `salience_weighted_overall_populism_index` remained consistently high across all twelve speeches, with no evidence of strategic intensification. This challenges theoretical models that posit populism as a flexible strategy that is ramped up in response to electoral dynamics. For Bolsonaro in 2018, populism appears to have been a static, foundational element of his political identity.

The specific profile of this populism is also clear: it is heavily reliant on the `manichaean_people_elite_framing` and `anti_pluralist_exclusion`. This combination points to a particularly antagonistic form of populism focused on moralizing the political struggle and delegitimizing any opposition. The synergistic relationship with `nationalist_exclusion` further specifies this as a form of national populism where the "pure people" are implicitly defined along national-cultural lines, and their will is positioned against both internal "corrupt elites" and external threats.

#### 5.6 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

*   **Discriminatory Power Analysis**: The PDAF framework proved highly effective at identifying the corpus as populist, with all documents scoring well above the 0.5 threshold. However, the narrow range of high scores (0.71 to 0.86) suggests limited discriminatory power *within* this specific set of highly populist texts. The framework successfully distinguished the corpus *as* populist but was less able to differentiate levels of populism between the speeches of a consistently populist speaker.

*   **Framework-Corpus Fit Evaluation**: The framework-corpus fit is assessed as **moderate (0.65/1.0)**. The framework was appropriate for the corpus, as evidenced by the high scores on relevant dimensions. However, the extremely low internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .211) for the core dimensions indicates a significant mismatch between the framework's theoretical structure and its empirical performance in this context. While the individual dimensions captured relevant phenomena, their grouping into "Core," "Mechanism," and "Boundary" categories was not validated by the statistical patterns in the data. This suggests that while the dimensional inventory is useful, the assumed theoretical architecture may not be universally applicable.

*   **Methodological Insights**: This analysis reveals a crucial insight for the PDAF and similar dimensional frameworks: theoretical coherence should not be assumed. The finding that the four "core" populist dimensions do not form a reliable scale in this corpus suggests that what are considered foundational elements of populism in academic literature may be deployed as discrete, independent strategies by political actors. This highlights the value of empirical testing of framework structures and suggests that a "rhetorical toolkit" model may be more accurate than a "unified ideology" model for certain populist actors.

### 6. Discussion

The statistical findings of this exploratory study offer a nuanced, data-driven portrait of Jair Bolsonaro's 2018 campaign rhetoric. The central narrative emerging from the data is not one of dynamic strategic adaptation but of a consistent and deeply embedded populist style. The rejection of the populist intensification hypothesis (H₂, H₉) is a significant finding. It suggests that for some political actors, populism is not merely a rhetorical mode to be dialed up or down but constitutes the very foundation of their political project. Bolsonaro's populism was a constant, not a variable.

The synergy found between nationalism and populism (falsifying H₃) provides empirical weight to theories of "national populism." In this discourse, appeals to the popular will and the construction of an exclusionary national identity were not in tension but were mutually reinforcing components of a single ideological project. This fusion is a key characteristic of his rhetorical signature.

Perhaps the most significant theoretical implication arises from the methodological findings. The poor internal consistency of the PDAF's core dimensions (H₁₂) is a powerful, data-driven critique of the framework's assumed structure. It suggests that the ideational approach's "thin-centered ideology," composed of several core tenets, may not always manifest as a psychologically or rhetorically cohesive whole. For a speaker like Bolsonaro, `anti_pluralist_exclusion` and `manichaean_people_elite_framing` may be powerful, independent tools used for specific purposes, rather than simply being indicators of a single latent "populism" score. This finding calls for greater scrutiny of the assumed dimensionality in populism measurement frameworks.

This study is constrained by its small sample size (N=12), which prevents definitive conclusions, especially regarding group comparisons. The inability to test hypotheses about audience adaptation (H₆, H₁₄) due to n=1 subgroups is a major limitation. Therefore, these findings should be treated as preliminary. Future research should aim to replicate this analysis with a larger and more varied corpus of speeches to confirm these patterns and enable more robust statistical testing. Expanding the analysis to include social media data could also provide a more comprehensive view of his multi-platform communication strategy.

### 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of Jair Bolsonaro's 2018 campaign speeches provides systematic, data-driven insights into his rhetorical strategy. The study confirms that his discourse was intensely and consistently populist, characterized by a stable deployment of antagonistic and exclusionary themes. Key findings challenge prevailing assumptions about populist intensification and the relationship between populism and nationalism, revealing instead a static, high-baseline populism where nationalist appeals were a synergistic element.

Methodologically, the analysis served as a crucial test of the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2. While the framework was effective in identifying and profiling the populist content, the results also issued a significant challenge to its internal theoretical structure, as the "core" dimensions failed to demonstrate internal consistency. This underscores the importance of empirical validation of analytical frameworks and suggests that populist rhetoric may, in some cases, be better conceived as a flexible toolkit of discrete strategies rather than a monolithic ideology. Despite the limitations imposed by the small sample size, this report lays a quantitative foundation for understanding the specific nature of Bolsonaro's populism and offers critical feedback for the refinement of computational discourse analysis methods.

### 8. Methodological Summary

The statistical analysis was conducted on a dataset of 12 documents, with scores generated for nine dimensions and several derived metrics using the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2. Given the sample size (N=12), the analysis was primarily exploratory. Key statistical methods included: descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations) to characterize the central tendency and dispersion of scores; Pearson's correlation analysis to investigate relationships between dimensions; and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression to test for a temporal trend in populist intensity. Internal consistency of a subset of framework dimensions was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Where group comparisons were hypothesized (e.g., pre- vs. post-event, by audience type), independent samples t-tests were planned; however, due to extremely small subgroup sizes (including n=1), these tests were either statistically invalid or lacked sufficient power to be meaningful. All interpretations were therefore made with caution, emphasizing descriptive patterns over inferential claims.
