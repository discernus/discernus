    "The experiment aims to replicate and extend a previous study using PDAF v10.0.2. Ensure that the data processing and statistical analysis steps are carefully aligned with the original study's methodology where applicable, and clearly document any deviations or extensions.",
    "Consider explicitly stating the null hypothesis for each hypothesis where relevant for clarity in the statistical analysis plan.",
    "The 'campaign_interruption' group in the 'Campaign Stage Groups' definition (n=1) might be too small for robust statistical comparison. Consider combining it with a 'mid_campaign' or 'late_campaign' group if the temporal proximity allows, or acknowledge its limitations as a single case analysis.",
    "The 'final_campaign' group (n=1) and 'election_day' group (n=1) and 'between_rounds' group (n=1) and 'final_hours' group (n=1) are also very small. For meaningful statistical analysis of these specific phases, consider if the corpus size allows for more granular temporal segmentation or if these should be grouped into broader phases to meet statistical power requirements.",
    "The 'approaching' electoral proximity group (n=3) and 'imminent' electoral proximity group (n=1) are also quite small. Evaluate if these can be meaningfully combined for statistical analysis, or if they should be treated as case studies.",
    "The 'business_leaders' audience type group has only one speech (n=1). This group will not be suitable for statistical comparison. Consider noting this limitation or combining it with another audience group if semantically appropriate.",
    "The 'final_campaign' (n=1), 'election_day' (n=1), 'between_rounds' (n=1), and 'final_hours' (n=1) campaign stages are single-document groups. These will be treated as baseline reference points and not used in inferential statistical comparisons like ANOVA, which is appropriate. Ensure this limitation is considered during analysis interpretation.",
    "The 'imminent' electoral proximity group (n=1) is a single-document group and will be treated as a baseline reference point for statistical comparisons. Ensure this limitation is considered during analysis interpretation."
