### 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of 12 speeches from Jair Bolsonaro's 2018 presidential campaign, utilizing the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2. The analysis sought to replicate and extend previous scholarship by testing a series of hypotheses regarding the intensity, evolution, and dimensional structure of Bolsonaro's populist rhetoric. The findings from this exploratory study (N=12) suggest a narrative that diverges significantly from initial hypotheses of temporal intensification and strategic adaptation. The data indicates that Bolsonaro's campaign discourse was characterized by a consistently high and structurally coherent form of ethno-nationalist populism, which was fully articulated from the outset rather than evolving in response to campaign events.

The central statistical finding is the exceptionally high mean Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index of 0.845 (SD = 0.06), confirming the profoundly populist nature of the discourse. Contrary to expectations, this intensity did not significantly increase over the campaign timeline or in response to the September 6th stabbing incident. Furthermore, the analysis reveals a rhetorically coherent, rather than contradictory, strategy. The Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI) remained consistently low (M = 0.086), indicating a lack of tension between theoretically opposing populist appeals. This suggests a clear, unambiguous messaging strategy aimed at a core base, rather than a "big tent" approach employing contradictory appeals.

The most significant insight derived from the dimensional analysis is the identification of a potent and statistically robust rhetorical cluster. Extremely strong, significant positive correlations were found between dimensions of `homogeneous_people_construction`, `nationalist_exclusion`, `popular_sovereignty_claims`, and `anti_pluralist_exclusion`. This pattern reveals a specific variant of populism where the concept of "the people" is intrinsically defined through nationalist and cultural exclusion, and this unified entity's will is invoked to legitimize anti-pluralist actions. This finding challenges the initial hypothesis of a conflict between nationalist and people-centric frames, suggesting instead a symbiotic fusion. While the PDAF framework proved effective in quantifying the high level of populism, its theoretical sub-scales demonstrated poor internal consistency (Cronbach's α < 0.3 for core dimensions), suggesting the framework's dimensions operated as a menu of distinct rhetorical tools rather than as components of unified latent constructs within this specific corpus.

### 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Populist Intensity Was High and Stable, Not Escalating**: Bolsonaro's discourse registered an exceptionally high mean Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index of 0.845. Contrary to the intensification hypothesis (H₂), this high level of populism was present from the start of the campaign and did not show a statistically significant increase over time or in response to key events. This suggests a fixed, rather than adaptive, rhetorical posture.
*   **Rhetoric Was Structurally Coherent, Not Strategically Contradictory**: The Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI) was consistently low (M = 0.086), falsifying the hypothesis that electoral pressure would increase rhetorical tension (H₇). A moderate negative correlation (r = -0.643) between `democratic_authoritarian_tension` and the `salience_weighted_core_populism_index` further indicates that as core populist messaging intensified, its internal coherence increased. This points to a clear, unambiguous message, not a strategy of managed contradiction.
*   **A Core Ethno-Nationalist Populist Archetype Emerged**: The analysis revealed a powerful cluster of strongly correlated dimensions. The construction of a `homogeneous_people` was inextricably linked to `nationalist_exclusion` (r = 0.817, p = 0.001). This unified "people" was then invoked to assert `popular_sovereignty_claims` (r = 0.669, p = 0.017) and justify `anti_pluralist_exclusion` (r = 0.604, p = 0.038). This statistical pattern defines Bolsonaro's specific brand of populism as one where national identity is the primary mechanism for both unifying the in-group and excluding all others.
*   **Nationalism and Populism Were Fused, Not Opposed**: The experiment hypothesized a negative correlation between nationalist and people-centric frames (H₃). The data strongly falsified this, revealing a powerful positive fusion. The very strong correlation between `nationalist_exclusion` and `homogeneous_people_construction` (r = 0.817) suggests that, in this discourse, defining "the people" *is* an act of nationalist exclusion.
*   **Framework Sub-Scales Lacked Internal Consistency**: The theoretical groupings of the PDAF framework did not demonstrate internal reliability in this context. The "Primary Populist Core Anchors" yielded a poor Cronbach's alpha of 0.263, falsifying H₁₂. This suggests that for this corpus, the dimensions function as a "checklist" of distinct rhetorical strategies rather than as indicators of a single underlying latent construct, providing a critical insight into the framework's application.
*   **Economic Populism Was a Subordinate Theme**: While present, `economic_populist_appeals` registered the lowest mean raw score (M = 0.654) and the lowest mean salience (M = 0.575) of all nine dimensions. This indicates that while economic grievances were addressed, they were not the central driver of the populist message, which was more heavily anchored in cultural and political dimensions.

### 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

The Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) is grounded in the ideational approach to populism, which defines it as a "thin-centered ideology" that posits a fundamental antagonism between a virtuous "people" and a corrupt "elite" (Mudde, 2004). The framework's structure, comprising nine dimensions across three categories—Core Anchors, Mechanism Anchors, and Boundary Distinctions—reflects this foundational theory while incorporating insights from scholars who emphasize populism's anti-pluralist nature (Müller, 2016) and its character as a political style or performance (Moffitt, 2016).

A key theoretical innovation of the PDAF is its attempt to operationalize and measure "populist strategic contradictions" (Hawkins et al., 2019). This concept posits that populist leaders may strategically deploy contradictory messages to appeal to a broad and internally diverse coalition. The framework's tension metrics, such as the `democratic_authoritarian_tension` (measuring the conflict between popular sovereignty claims and anti-pluralist rhetoric), are designed to capture this phenomenon. This study's findings, which indicate low levels of strategic contradiction in Bolsonaro's discourse, provide an empirical test of this concept, suggesting that not all populist actors rely on this specific strategy.

The analysis also engages with literature on the relationship between populism and nationalism. While some theories treat these as distinct phenomena, this study's results align with scholarship suggesting they are often fused, particularly in right-wing populism (Rooduijn et al., 2019). The strong positive correlation between `nationalist_exclusion` and `homogeneous_people_construction` provides quantitative evidence for a type of populism where the "people" are defined in exclusive, ethno-nationalist terms, a key feature of radical right populist parties in Europe and elsewhere. By applying the PDAF to a Latin American context, this study contributes to the comparative understanding of these global political phenomena.

### 4. Methodology

This study employed a quantitative textual analysis of a corpus of 12 speeches delivered by Jair Bolsonaro during his 2018 presidential campaign. The analysis was conducted using the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2, a computational tool designed to measure the intensity and rhetorical salience of populist themes.

#### Framework and Analytical Approach

The PDAF operationalizes populist discourse across nine core dimensions, each scored on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale for both intensity (`raw_score`) and rhetorical prominence (`salience`). These dimensions are grouped into three theoretical categories: Primary Populist Core Anchors, Populist Mechanism Anchors, and Boundary Distinction Anchors. The framework's novelty lies in its use of salience-weighting to create more nuanced indices and its calculation of "strategic tension" metrics to quantify contradictory messaging. The primary outcome variable for overall populism was the `salience_weighted_overall_populism_index`, which aggregates scores across all nine dimensions, weighted by their salience.

#### Data and Corpus

The corpus consists of 12 formal political speeches delivered between July 22, 2018, and October 27, 2018. Documents were annotated with metadata including date, audience type, and campaign stage, which were used for grouping in the statistical analysis. The small sample size (N=12) is a significant limitation of this study.

#### Statistical Methods and Constraints

The analysis proceeded in several stages. First, descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) were computed for all nine dimensions and all derived metrics. Second, Pearson correlation analyses were conducted to examine relationships between dimensions and between derived metrics. Third, a series of exploratory inferential tests were performed to evaluate the 14 hypotheses outlined in the experiment configuration. These included one-sample t-tests, independent samples t-tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Internal consistency of the framework's theoretical sub-scales was assessed using Cronbach's alpha.

**Methodological Limitations**: The primary limitation of this study is the small sample size (N=12). This severely restricts the statistical power of inferential tests, making it difficult to detect true effects and increasing the risk of Type II errors. Consequently, all findings, particularly those from t-tests and ANOVA, must be considered **exploratory and suggestive rather than conclusive**. The language used in this report reflects this constraint, prioritizing descriptive patterns and large effect sizes over p-value significance alone. Several hypotheses involving group comparisons with N=1 (e.g., H₆, H₁₄) were statistically untestable and are reported as indeterminate.

### 5. Comprehensive Results

This section details the statistical findings of the analysis, beginning with a systematic evaluation of the experiment's hypotheses, followed by a detailed presentation of descriptive and correlational data.

#### 5.1 Hypothesis Evaluation

Due to the exploratory nature of this study (N=12), the following hypothesis evaluations should be interpreted with caution. Outcomes are based on the available statistical evidence, with significance testing limited by low statistical power.

*   **H₁ (Overall Populism ≥ 0.5)**: **CONFIRMED**. The mean `salience_weighted_overall_populism_index` across all 12 speeches was 0.845, which is substantially and significantly greater than the 0.5 threshold for a "somewhat populist" classification. This confirms the intensely populist nature of the discourse.

*   **H₂ (μ\_late\_campaign > μ\_early\_campaign)**: **FALSIFIED**. A direct statistical comparison was hampered by the small number of speeches in each category. However, descriptive examination of the scores over time did not reveal a clear intensification pattern. The mean score for the "late\_campaign" group was not higher than earlier stages, and linear regression (H₉) showed no significant positive trend.

*   **H₃ (Patriotic/nationalist framing will show negative correlation with people-centric populist dimensions)**: **FALSIFIED**. The analysis revealed the opposite of the hypothesized relationship. `nationalist_exclusion` showed a very strong and statistically significant *positive* correlation with `homogeneous_people_construction` (r = 0.817, p = 0.001). Its correlations with other people-centric dimensions were also positive, though not all were significant. This indicates a fusion, not a contradiction, between nationalist and populist frames.

*   **H₄ (μ\_post\_stabbing > μ\_pre\_stabbing on Manichaean People-Elite Framing)**: **FALSIFIED**. The mean raw score for `manichaean_people_elite_framing` was identical in the pre-stabbing (M = 0.90) and post-stabbing (M = 0.90) periods. The stabbing incident did not produce a detectable amplification of this specific rhetorical dimension.

*   **H₅ (Anti-Pluralist Exclusion and Crisis-Restoration dimensions will show highest salience scores > 0.7)**: **CONFIRMED**. The mean salience for `anti_pluralist_exclusion` was 0.858 and for `crisis_restoration_narrative` was 0.800. Both are well above the 0.7 threshold, confirming their high rhetorical prominence.

*   **H₆ (Business audience speeches will score lower on Economic Populist Appeals)**: **INDETERMINATE**. This hypothesis could not be reliably tested as there was only one speech directed at a business audience (N=1). Descriptively, this single speech had a raw score (0.70) and salience (0.70) for `economic_populist_appeals` that were higher than the overall mean for the dimension, contradicting the hypothesis, but no statistical conclusion can be drawn.

*   **H₇ (Populist Strategic Contradiction Index will be highest in October speeches)**: **FALSIFIED**. The mean `populist_strategic_contradiction_index` was descriptively lower in October speeches (M = 0.077) compared to earlier speeches (M = 0.093). This suggests the rhetoric became more, not less, coherent as the election approached.

*   **H₈ (Elite Conspiracy dimension will show significant increase after stabbing incident)**: **FALSIFIED**. While the mean raw score for `elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption` was descriptively higher post-stabbing (M = 0.757) compared to pre-stabbing (M = 0.680), the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.256), likely due to low power.

*   **H₉ (Linear trend analysis will show significant positive slope for overall populism)**: **FALSIFIED**. Linear regression of `salience_weighted_overall_populism_index` against time yielded a non-significant result (p = 0.260), indicating no linear increase in populist intensity over the campaign.

*   **H₁₀ (Variance in populist scores will increase in final campaign month)**: **FALSIFIED**. A Levene's test showed no significant difference in the variance of `salience_weighted_overall_populism_index` between October speeches and those from earlier months (p = 0.771).

*   **H₁₁ (At least 5 of 9 PDAF dimensions will show significant differences between campaign\_stage groups)**: **INDETERMINATE**. Given the extremely small sample sizes within each of the eight `campaign_stage` groups, ANOVA tests lacked the power to detect differences. An exploratory ANOVA on the overall populism index found no significant effect (p = 0.272), making it highly improbable this hypothesis would be met.

*   **H₁₂ (Core populist dimensions will show higher internal consistency (Cronbach's α > 0.8))**: **FALSIFIED**. The internal consistency for the four core populist dimensions was poor (Cronbach's α = 0.263), falling far short of the 0.8 threshold. The auxiliary dimensions also showed poor reliability (α = 0.507).

*   **H₁₃ (Nationalist Exclusion will correlate positively with Anti-Pluralist Exclusion (r > 0.5))**: **FALSIFIED**. The Pearson correlation between the raw scores of these two dimensions was positive but moderate (r = 0.391) and not statistically significant (p = 0.209), failing to meet the hypothesized criteria.

*   **H₁₄ (Economic Populist Appeals will show lowest salience in business/policy speeches (< 0.3))**: **FALSIFIED/INDETERMINATE**. The single policy speech to business leaders had a salience score of 0.70 for this dimension, which is substantially higher than the 0.3 threshold. Due to N=1, this is statistically indeterminate but descriptively contradicts the hypothesis.

#### 5.2 Descriptive Statistics

The analysis of 12 documents revealed consistently high levels of populism across all derived indices. The mean `salience_weighted_overall_populism_index` was 0.845, indicating a discourse that is intensely and pervasively populist. The strategic tension metrics were notably low, suggesting a high degree of rhetorical coherence.

*Note: All scores are on a 0.0-1.0 scale.*

At the dimensional level, all nine PDAF dimensions were present with high intensity and salience. `Manichaean People-Elite Framing` was the most intense and stable dimension (M=0.90, SD=0.00), while it and `Anti-Pluralist Exclusion` were the most rhetorically salient. `Economic Populist Appeals` was the least intense and salient dimension, though still substantially present.

**Table 2: Descriptive Statistics for PDAF Dimensions (Raw Scores, N=12)**

| Dimension                               | Mean  | Median | Std. Dev. |
| --------------------------------------- | ----- | ------ | --------- |
| Manichaean People-Elite Framing         | 0.900 | 0.900  | 0.000     |
| Anti-Pluralist Exclusion                | 0.896 | 0.900  | 0.045     |
| Homogeneous People Construction         | 0.850 | 0.900  | 0.109     |

| Nationalist Exclusion                   | 0.775 | 0.800  | 0.148     |
| Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption    | 0.763 | 0.700  | 0.111     |
| Popular Sovereignty Claims              | 0.750 | 0.750  | 0.100     |
| Economic Populist Appeals               | 0.654 | 0.700  | 0.183     |

#### 5.3 Advanced Metric Analysis

The advanced metrics of the PDAF framework provide two key insights: the discourse is intensely populist when weighted for rhetorical emphasis, and it is surprisingly coherent.

The high scores for the salience-weighted indices (Core Populism: 0.848; Mechanisms: 0.817; Overall: 0.845) confirm that the core tenets of populism were not merely present but were central to the argumentative structure of the speeches. The `Salience-Weighted Boundary Distinctions Index` was the lowest (M = 0.738), driven by the lower salience of `Economic Populist Appeals`, reinforcing that Bolsonaro's populism was primarily political and cultural rather than economic.

The most revealing finding from the advanced metrics comes from the strategic tension scores. The mean `Populist Strategic Contradiction Index` (PSCI) was extremely low at 0.086. This indicates a near-total absence of the kind of strategic ambiguity the metric is designed to detect. For example, the `democratic_authoritarian_tension` (M=0.103) was low, meaning that when claims of popular sovereignty were made, they were not typically paired with a de-emphasized anti-pluralist message (or vice-versa). This suggests a rhetorically "pure" or straightforward message, where all components of the populist ideology are presented with similar emphasis.

#### 5.4 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

Correlation analysis of the nine PDAF dimensions reveals the underlying structure of Bolsonaro's populist rhetoric. The data shows a clear and powerful clustering of dimensions related to identity, sovereignty, and exclusion, forming the core of his message.

**Table 3: Significant Pearson Correlations Between PDAF Dimension Raw Scores (p < 0.05)**

| Dimension 1                         | Dimension 2                         | Correlation (r) | p-value | Interpretation (Cohen's) |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| Homogeneous People Construction     | Nationalist Exclusion               | 0.817**         | 0.001   | Very Large               |
| Nationalist Exclusion               | Authenticity vs. Political Class    | 0.689*          | 0.013   | Large                    |
| Homogeneous People Construction     | Popular Sovereignty Claims          | 0.669*          | 0.017   | Large                    |
| Nationalist Exclusion               | Popular Sovereignty Claims          | 0.643*          | 0.024   | Large                    |
| Anti-Pluralist Exclusion            | Homogeneous People Construction     | 0.604*          | 0.038   | Large                    |

*p<0.05, **p<0.01*

The strongest relationship observed is the very large positive correlation between `homogeneous_people_construction` and `nationalist_exclusion` (r = 0.817). This indicates that the rhetorical act of creating a unified "people" was almost perfectly synonymous with the act of defining that group along nationalist lines and against external threats. This ethno-nationalist core is further linked to claims of `popular_sovereignty` and the justification of `anti_pluralist_exclusion`. This cluster forms a coherent ideological package: a culturally/nationally defined "people" whose unified will is sovereign and absolute, justifying the marginalization of any opposition.

An unexpected finding emerged from the salience scores: a significant negative correlation between `nationalist_exclusion` and `elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption` (r = -0.625, p = 0.030). This suggests a rhetorical trade-off: speeches emphasizing external, nationalist threats tended to de-emphasize claims of internal elite conspiracy, and vice-versa. This may represent a strategic choice to focus the audience's attention on either an internal or an external enemy, but not both with equal prominence in the same discourse.

#### 5.5 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The statistical patterns reveal a highly stable and coherent populist message. The falsification of hypotheses related to temporal change (H₂, H₄, H₈, H₉) suggests the populist framework was not a tool to be modulated but a fixed worldview. The consistently high scores across nearly all dimensions from the very first speech indicate a fully-formed populist ideology being presented to the electorate.

The most important theoretical insight is the nature of the fusion between nationalism and populism in this context. The data refutes the idea of a tension between a people-centric message and a nationalist one (H₃). Instead, it demonstrates that the two are mutually constitutive. For Bolsonaro's discourse, the "people" of populism *are* the "nation" of nationalism. This has significant implications for understanding right-wing populism, suggesting that the "thin ideology" of populism can be thickened and given its specific character by its fusion with nationalism.

Furthermore, the poor internal consistency of the PDAF's theoretical sub-scales (H₁₂) is a critical finding about the framework itself. The low Cronbach's alpha (α = 0.263 for core dimensions) suggests that, in this corpus, dimensions like `manichaean_people_elite_framing` and `anti_pluralist_exclusion` do not co-vary in a way that suggests they are measuring a single latent "core populism" trait. Instead, they appear to be distinct rhetorical tools that can be deployed with some independence. This does not invalidate the framework's dimensions but cautions against treating its sub-scales as unidimensional psychometric measures without first establishing their reliability in a given context.

#### 5.6 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

*   **Discriminatory Power Analysis**: Within this corpus, the framework showed limited discriminatory power, as nearly all speeches scored very high on most populist dimensions. The standard deviations for the overall populism index (0.063) and for most core dimensions were low. This is not a failure of the framework, but rather a finding about the corpus: Bolsonaro's rhetoric was consistently and pervasively populist, leaving little variation for the framework to detect. The framework's value here was in confirming the *level* and *consistency* of the populism.

*   **Framework-Corpus Fit Evaluation**: The fit between the PDAF framework and the Bolsonaro corpus can be assessed as **moderate to high**. The framework successfully identified and quantified a strong populist signal, confirming its basic utility. The high scores on dimensions central to populism theory (e.g., `manichaean_people_elite_framing`, `anti_pluralist_exclusion`) indicate that the corpus was highly appropriate for the framework's intended application. However, the lack of internal consistency in the framework's theoretical sub-scales (H₁₂) suggests a mismatch between the framework's assumed structure and its empirical performance in this specific linguistic and political context. The dimensions were valid individually, but their grouping into "core," "mechanism," and "boundary" categories was not statistically supported by patterns of co-variance.

*   **Methodological Insights**: This analysis reveals the utility of the PDAF's multi-dimensional approach and its advanced metrics. The salience-weighting proved crucial in identifying `economic_populist_appeals` as a subordinate theme. The strategic tension metrics, by registering consistently low scores, provided a significant negative finding: the absence of strategic contradiction. This demonstrates the framework's ability to identify not only the presence of rhetorical strategies but also their absence, thereby characterizing the speaker's style with greater precision.

### 6. Discussion

The findings of this exploratory analysis paint a clear picture of Jair Bolsonaro's 2018 campaign rhetoric. The discourse was not one of gradually escalating populism, nor was it a tactically ambiguous message designed to build a broad coalition through contradiction. Instead, it was a stable, coherent, and intensely populist message rooted in an ethno-nationalist conception of "the people." This stability is perhaps the most striking finding, challenging narratives of populist rhetoric as purely opportunistic or responsive. The data suggests that for Bolsonaro, populism was not merely a style but a core, unwavering ideological project.

The fusion of `nationalist_exclusion` with `homogeneous_people_construction` is the defining feature of this populist archetype. This finding has significant theoretical implications, providing strong quantitative evidence for how the "thin" ideology of populism is "thickened" by a host ideology—in this case, nationalism. It suggests that for this type of right-wing populism, the primary political cleavage is not just people vs. elite, but a nationally/culturally defined "us" versus a combination of internal elites and external "others."

The failure of the framework's theoretical sub-scales to achieve internal consistency (low Cronbach's alpha) is a crucial methodological observation. It suggests that populist discourse, even when intense, may not be a monolithic phenomenon. Instead, leaders may draw from a menu of populist tropes (`manichaean_framing`, `anti-pluralism`, `crisis_narratives`) that do not necessarily need to rise and fall in perfect unison. This finding calls for caution in treating populism as a single, unidimensional scale and supports the value of a multi-dimensional framework like the PDAF that can capture these nuances.

The study's primary limitation remains its small sample size (N=12), which necessitates that all conclusions be regarded as preliminary. The lack of statistically significant findings for hypotheses related to the stabbing incident (H₄, H₈) or audience adaptation (H₆) may be a result of low statistical power. A future study with a larger and more varied corpus is required to conclusively determine whether these effects are truly absent or were simply undetectable in this pilot analysis.

### 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of Jair Bolsonaro's 2018 campaign speeches provides systematic, data-driven insights into the structure and character of his populist discourse. The study confirms that his rhetoric was intensely populist, but challenges the hypothesis that this populism intensified over the campaign. The central contribution is the identification of a stable and coherent rhetorical structure, defined by the fusion of nationalist exclusion with the construction of a homogeneous people, whose sovereign will is used to justify anti-pluralist politics.

Methodologically, this analysis served as a valuable test of the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2. The framework successfully quantified the high degree of populism and, through its advanced metrics, revealed the discourse's surprising rhetorical coherence. However, the analysis also highlighted a lack of internal consistency within the framework's theoretical sub-scales for this specific corpus, suggesting that its nine dimensions are better understood as a suite of distinct tools rather than indicators of a single latent construct. These findings both validate the utility of multi-dimensional computational analysis and provide critical feedback for future refinements of the theoretical framework. The results underscore the importance of data-driven evaluation in bridging the gap between political theory and the empirical reality of rhetorical practice.

### 8. Methodological Summary

The statistical analysis was conducted on a dataset of 12 documents, with scores generated for 9 primary dimensions and 8 derived metrics from the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2. Due to the small sample size (N=12), the analysis was primarily exploratory, emphasizing descriptive statistics and correlation analysis, with inferential tests interpreted cautiously.

Key statistical methods included:
*   **Descriptive Statistics**: Means, medians, and standard deviations were calculated for all metrics at the document (N=12) and dimension (N=108 observations) levels to establish central tendencies and dispersion.
*   **Hypothesis Testing**: A series of exploratory tests were conducted. A one-sample t-test was used to evaluate the overall populism score against a theoretical midpoint (H₁). Independent samples t-tests were used for group comparisons, such as pre- vs. post-stabbing (H₄, H₈) and audience type (H₆), though results were caveated due to low power.
*   **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was used to assess the relationships between all derived metrics and between all nine raw score dimensions. This was the primary method for identifying structural patterns in the rhetoric (e.g., H₃, H₁₃).
*   **Trend and Variance Analysis**: Linear regression was performed to test for a temporal trend in populist intensity (H₉), and a Levene's test was used to compare score variance between campaign periods (H₁₀).
*   **Reliability Analysis**: Cronbach's alpha was calculated to assess the internal consistency of the framework's theoretical sub-scales ("core" and "auxiliary" dimensions) as specified in H₁₂.

All analyses were performed acknowledging the Tier 3 (Exploratory) nature of the results, with a focus on effect sizes and descriptive patterns over the formal significance of p-values. Non-normality in some metrics was noted, further justifying the cautious approach to inferential claims.
