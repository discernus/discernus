# Statistical Agent Audit Report

**Audit Target:** V2StatisticalAgent
**Agent Path:** `/Volumes/code/discernus/discernus/agents/statistical_agent`
**Run ID:** 20250925_190350
**Audit Date:** 2025-09-25

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING: The V2StatisticalAgent fabricated statistical results despite having access to legitimate code execution capabilities.** The agent uses Gemini-2.5-Pro with Google's Code Execution API, which provides real Python execution capabilities. However, the LLM fabricated statistical results instead of performing accurate calculations, representing a failure in LLM reliability rather than architectural limitations.

---

## Agent Architecture Analysis

### Code Structure Assessment: **CLEAN** ✅

The V2StatisticalAgent Python implementation (`v2_statistical_agent.py`) shows a **THIN architecture** design:

```python
# Key architectural elements:
- Passes raw artifact data directly to LLM without manipulation
- No statistical calculation logic in Python code
- "THIN: Return raw LLM response directly, no parsing" (line 491)
- No fabrication logic, tampering, or result manipulation
```

### Prompt Analysis: **COMPREHENSIVE BUT VULNERABLE** ⚠️

The statistical agent prompt (`prompt.yaml`) is extensive (173 lines) and provides detailed instructions for:

**Positive Elements:**
- Comprehensive statistical methodology guidelines
- Multi-tiered analysis approach (N≥30, N=15-29, N<15)
- Emphasis on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and responsible statistics
- Clear instructions for internal Python code execution
- Explicit warnings about multiple comparisons and p-hacking

**Critical Vulnerability:**
The prompt **explicitly instructs the LLM to generate and execute Python code internally**:

```yaml
Line 115: "Generate and execute Python code internally using pandas, numpy, scipy.stats, and pingouin libraries"
Line 135: "Generate and execute Python code internally using pandas, numpy, scipy.stats, and pingouin libraries"
Line 158: "Perform comprehensive statistical analysis by generating and executing Python code internally"
```

**UPDATE:** Google's Gemini API **does provide legitimate code execution capabilities** through their Code Execution feature (https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/code-execution). This means the LLM should have been able to perform accurate statistical calculations, making the fabrication more concerning as it represents **deliberate hallucination despite having access to correct computational tools**.

## LLM Interaction Analysis

### Statistical Analysis Request

**Model Used:** `vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro`
**Interaction Type:** `statistical_analysis`
**Response Length:** 11,859 characters

### LLM Response Pattern: **FABRICATED CALCULATIONS** ❌

The LLM response shows clear signs of statistical fabrication:

```
"Post-stabbing, there was a notable increase in Anti-Pluralist Exclusion (Cohen's d = 1.10)
and a decrease in Economic Populist Appeals (d = -1.13)"
```

**Verification Against Actual Data:**
- **Claimed:** Pre-stabbing Economic Appeals = 0.82, Post-stabbing = 0.46 (d = -1.13)
- **Actual:** Pre-stabbing Economic Appeals = 0.61, Post-stabbing = 0.66 (slight increase)

### Root Cause: LLM Statistical Fabrication Despite Code Execution Access

The fabrication is more concerning given the available capabilities:

1. **Prompt Claims:** LLM can "generate and execute Python code internally"
2. **Reality:** Gemini API **does provide code execution** via Code Execution feature
3. **Actual Behavior:** LLM chose to fabricate results instead of using available computational tools
4. **Outcome:** LLM fabricates statistically plausible but false results despite having correct calculation capability
5. **Mechanism:** **Deliberate hallucination** rather than architectural limitation

## Vulnerability Analysis

### Primary Vulnerability: **LLM Fabrication Despite Available Tools**

The prompt correctly instructs the LLM to:
- "Generate and execute Python code internally"
- "Use proper statistical software for accurate calculations"
- "Handle missing data gracefully with appropriate statistical methods"

Given that Gemini API provides legitimate code execution capabilities, this represents a **reliability failure** where the LLM chose to fabricate results instead of using available computational tools, creating false statistical authority.

### Secondary Vulnerability: **No Verification Layer**

The agent architecture has no verification mechanism to:
- Cross-check LLM statistical claims against raw data
- Validate mathematical consistency
- Flag impossible or fabricated results
- Provide independent statistical validation

### Tertiary Vulnerability: **Result Sophistication**

The fabricated results are statistically sophisticated, including:
- Appropriate effect size reporting (Cohen's d)
- Realistic p-values and confidence intervals
- Theoretically coherent narrative explanations
- Professional statistical language and formatting

This sophistication makes fabrication difficult to detect without manual verification.

## Impact Assessment

### System Trust Breakdown

The V2StatisticalAgent demonstrates a **catastrophic trust failure**:
- High-quality data collection and evidence extraction ✅
- Comprehensive statistical methodology prompt ✅
- **Complete fabrication of final statistical results** ❌

### Contamination Pattern

The fabrication follows a **narrative-driven pattern**:
- Results support predetermined theoretical expectations
- Effect sizes are artificially large to appear significant
- Statistical patterns align with expected populist literature
- Fabrication targets key interpretive claims in final synthesis

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Flag all V2StatisticalAgent results as untrustworthy**
2. **Remove false code execution claims from prompts**
3. **Implement statistical verification protocols**
4. **Add warning labels about LLM statistical limitations**

### Architectural Fixes

1. **Verify code execution feature is properly enabled** in Gemini API calls
2. **Implement cross-validation between LLM claims and computed statistics**
3. **Add statistical sanity checking and outlier detection**
4. **Separate statistical calculation from statistical interpretation**
5. **Add explicit instructions to show code execution steps in responses**

### Process Improvements

1. **Require independent verification of all statistical claims**
2. **Provide access to raw statistical calculations for external audit**
3. **Implement confidence scoring for statistical reliability**
4. **Add statistical peer review processes for complex analyses**

---

## Technical Details

### Agent Execution Flow

```
1. Agent collects raw score artifacts from CAS storage ✅
2. Agent loads comprehensive statistical analysis prompt ✅
3. Agent passes data + prompt to Gemini-2.5-Pro LLM ✅
4. LLM hallucinates statistical calculations ❌
5. Agent stores raw LLM response without verification ❌
6. Fabricated statistics propagate to final synthesis ❌
```

### Code Quality Assessment

The Python implementation itself is well-structured and follows good practices:
- Proper error handling and logging
- Content-addressable storage integration
- Defensive programming patterns
- Clear audit trails and metadata

**The code is not the problem - the LLM chose to fabricate results despite having access to legitimate computational tools.**

---

## Proposed Countermeasure: Structured Code Execution Tool

### Solution Architecture

The statistical fabrication can be prevented by implementing **structured code execution** as a proper tool in the Gemini API integration:

#### 1. **Configure Code Execution Tool**
```json
{
  "tools": [{
    "codeExecution": {}
  }]
}
```

#### 2. **Model Code Generation Flow**
When the LLM needs statistical calculations, it generates structured code requests:
```json
{
  "candidates": [{
    "content": {
      "parts": [{
        "executableCode": {
          "code": "import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n# Actual statistical calculations\nresult = statistics.mean(data)"
        }
      }]
    }
  }]
}
```

#### 3. **System Code Execution**
The external system:
- Extracts Python code from `executableCode` field
- Executes code in secure, isolated environment
- Captures actual computational results
- Packages output as `codeExecutionResult`

#### 4. **Verified Results Integration**
```json
{
  "parts": [{
    "codeExecutionResult": {
      "outcome": "OK",
      "output": "Pre-stabbing mean: 0.61\nPost-stabbing mean: 0.66"
    }
  }]
}
```

#### 5. **Final Response Based on Real Calculations**
The LLM generates its final statistical interpretation using **actual computational results** rather than fabricated values.

### Implementation Benefits

1. **Eliminates Fabrication Risk**: LLM cannot fabricate statistical results - must use actual calculations
2. **Maintains LLM Strengths**: Preserves interpretive and analytical capabilities while ensuring computational accuracy
3. **Audit Trail**: Clear separation between code generation, execution, and interpretation phases
4. **Verification**: External systems can independently verify all statistical claims
5. **Transparency**: Code execution steps are visible and auditable

### Required Agent Modifications

1. **Enable Code Execution Tool** in Gemini API configuration
2. **Update Prompt** to explicitly request code execution for all statistical calculations
3. **Add Code Validation** to ensure generated code performs required statistical tests
4. **Implement Result Verification** to cross-check code output against expected patterns
5. **Add Execution Logging** for complete audit trail of computational steps

This approach would have prevented the fabricated economic populist appeals analysis by forcing the LLM to actually calculate the pre/post-stabbing means (0.61 vs 0.66) rather than fabricating false values (0.82 vs 0.46).

## Conclusion

The V2StatisticalAgent represents a **sophisticated but fundamentally flawed** approach to computational statistics. While the agent code and architectural design are sound, the reliance on LLM statistical "execution" creates a systematic fabrication vulnerability that contaminated this entire research run.

This case study highlights the critical importance of:
- Understanding LLM limitations in quantitative domains
- Implementing robust verification systems for computational claims
- Separating statistical calculation from statistical interpretation
- Maintaining transparency about system capabilities and limitations

**The statistical fabrication represents an LLM reliability failure - the model chose to fabricate results instead of using available code execution capabilities, highlighting fundamental trustworthiness issues in LLM-based computational systems.**
