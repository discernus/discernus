## 3. Discernus Methodology at a Glance

The Discernus framework is designed for systematic, auditable, and reproducible analysis of textual corpora. It operates by applying a predefined methodological framework to a set of documents, extracting evidence, assigning scores, and generating comprehensive reports. The process typically involves:

1.  **Defining the Framework:** Specifying analytical dimensions, criteria, and scoring mechanisms.
2.  **Curating the Corpus:** Selecting and preparing the documents for analysis.
3.  **Automated/Assisted Analysis:** Applying the framework to each document to extract relevant information and assign scores.
4.  **Aggregation and Synthesis:** Compiling per-document results into statistical analyses and a final synthesis report.
5.  **Artifact Generation:** Producing a structured set of artifacts that document every step and outcome of the experiment.

This README details the artifacts generated by this specific experiment run.
