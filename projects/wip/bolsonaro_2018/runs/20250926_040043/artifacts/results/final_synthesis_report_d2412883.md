### 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of 12 campaign speeches by Jair Bolsonaro during the 2018 Brazilian presidential election, utilizing the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2. The primary objective was to replicate and extend existing scholarship by quantifying the intensity, dimensional profile, and temporal evolution of Bolsonaro's populist rhetoric. The analysis was conducted on a small corpus (N=12), rendering the findings preliminary and exploratory, with a focus on descriptive patterns and effect sizes rather than conclusive statistical inference.

The central finding of this study is that Bolsonaro's campaign discourse was characterized by a **consistently high and stable level of multi-dimensional populism**, rather than a strategically intensifying one. The mean Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index across all speeches was exceptionally high at 0.81, confirming the profoundly populist nature of the rhetoric. As Jair Bolsonaro stated: "Ou colocamos gente como nós na política, ou não temos futuro." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_candidacy_launch) This sentiment, expressed early in the campaign, exemplifies the core "people vs. elite" framing that permeated his discourse. Contrary to the experiment's primary temporal hypotheses, the analysis did not find evidence of populist intensification as the election approached. Instead, a slight but non-significant negative trend was observed, suggesting the populist messaging was fully deployed from the outset and maintained at a near-ceiling level throughout the campaign. This stability was further evidenced by the lack of a significant rhetorical shift in key populist dimensions following the September 6th assassination attempt, challenging the "crisis amplification" hypothesis.

Methodologically, the analysis reveals important insights into the PDAF's performance. While the framework effectively identified the discourse's populist character, the dimensional structure exhibited low internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.211 for core dimensions), suggesting that in this high-intensity context, the framework's dimensions functioned as a "toolkit" of independent rhetorical strategies rather than a cohesive ideological syndrome. Furthermore, the study found that nationalist and populist appeals were complementary, with `Nationalist Exclusion` showing a significant positive correlation with `Popular Sovereignty Claims` (r = 0.627), indicating an integrated rhetorical strategy that fuses national identity with the populist call for unmediated popular will. This fusion is evident in statements such as: "O Brasil é nosso, é meu, é de vocês! Esse movimento vem da raiz, vem da alma do povo sofrido que quer e terá a mudança." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_avenida_paulista_sep30), where national ownership is directly linked to the will of the suffering people.

### 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **Populist Rhetoric Was Intensely and Stably Deployed:** The analysis reveals an exceptionally high mean Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index of 0.81. This suggests Bolsonaro's populist discourse was not a peripheral tactic but a core, consistently maintained feature of his communication, operating at a near-maximum intensity throughout the campaign. This intense and stable deployment is captured in the definitive rejection of the political establishment: As Jair Bolsonaro declared: "A gente vai aposentar de uma vez por todas. É PT, é PSDB e é um escambau, porque o nosso capitão é Jair Messias Bolsonaro." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_aracatuba_part1)
*   **No Evidence of Temporal Intensification:** Hypotheses predicting an increase in populism over time (H₂, H₉) or in the final campaign month (H₇, H₁₀) were falsified. A non-significant negative linear trend (p = 0.089) indicates the populist strategy was fully formed and deployed early, rather than escalating in response to electoral pressure.
*   **Core Populist Themes Dominated the Discourse:** The most salient dimensions were `Manichaean People-Elite Framing` (M = 0.88), `Anti-Pluralist Exclusion` (M = 0.86), and `Homogeneous People Construction` (M = 0.82). This dimensional profile highlights a rhetorical strategy centered on a moral struggle against a corrupt elite, the delegitimization of political opposition, and the construction of a unified "people."
    *   The `Manichaean People-Elite Framing` is exemplified by the speaker's contrast between national interest and partisan politics: As Jair Bolsonaro stated: "Falta, realmente, políticos comprometidos com o seu país e não com grupos políticos partidários." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_pre_first_round)
    *   `Anti-Pluralist Exclusion` was frequently expressed through aggressive calls against political opponents: As Jair Bolsonaro urged: "Luta! Acaba com a esquerda!" (Source: bolsonaro_2018_juiz_fora_business)
    *   The `Homogeneous People Construction` sought to unify the nation by identifying a common enemy: As Jair Bolsonaro articulated: "Juntos, nós temos como unir o nosso povo brasileiro, que foi desunido pela espe-- pela esquerda nos últimos anos. Somos um só país, uma só pátria, uma só nação, um só coração verde e amarelo." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_candidacy_launch)
*   **Nationalism Complemented, Not Contradicted, Populism:** The hypothesis of a negative relationship between nationalism and people-centric populism (H₃) was falsified. A statistically significant, large positive correlation was found between `Nationalist Exclusion` and `Popular Sovereignty Claims` (r = 0.627, p = 0.029), suggesting that in Bolsonaro's discourse, appeals to national identity and boundary-drawing were used to reinforce, not replace, claims of direct popular will. This is powerfully illustrated by the fusion of national pride with the rejection of opposing ideologies: As Jair Bolsonaro proclaimed: "Vamos fazer o Brasil grande. Vamos nos orgulhar novamente dessa pátria. Vamos afastar disso que não deu certo, que é o socialismo, que é o comunismo, que tá encarnado no PT, no PCdoB, no PSOL. ... Brasil acima de tudo, Deus acima de todos.]" (Source: bolsonaro_2018_pre_first_round)
*   **Real-World Crisis Did Not Amplify Key Populist Narratives:** Contrary to expectations (H₄, H₈), the assassination attempt on September 6th did not lead to a statistically significant increase in `Manichaean People-Elite Framing` or `Elite Conspiracy` scores. The stability of these high-scoring dimensions suggests the rhetorical framework was already operating at a level of intensity that was not measurably altered by this major external event.
*   **Framework Dimensions Acted as an Independent Toolkit:** The analysis found very low internal consistency among the PDAF's core populist dimensions (Cronbach's α = 0.211), falsifying the hypothesis of high reliability (H₁₂). This suggests that for this specific, high-intensity populist speaker, the dimensions may not represent a single latent ideological construct but rather a versatile set of independent rhetorical tools deployed as needed. For instance, the construction of a homogeneous people could be rigidly exclusionary, as when Jair Bolsonaro stated: "Nasceu? É macho ou é fêmea e ponto final! [...] Ideologia de gênero é a ponta da praga. Seu nome é homem e é mulher, e ponto final!" (Source: bolsonaro_2018_candidacy_launch), or surprisingly inclusive, as when he said: "tá em jogo no momento, é o futuro de todos vocês que tão aí. Até de você que apoia o PT, você é um ser humano também." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_post_stabbing). These contrasting approaches to homogeneity highlight the independent deployment of rhetorical tools.

### 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

This study is situated at the intersection of populism studies (Mudde, 2004; Müller, 2016), political communication (Moffitt, 2016), and computational social science. The Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) employed here is grounded in the "ideational approach," which defines populism as a "thin-centered ideology" that pits a virtuous and homogeneous "people" against a corrupt and self-serving "elite" (Mudde, 2004). The framework extends this core definition by incorporating dimensions that capture anti-pluralism (Müller, 2016), crisis narratives (Moffitt, 2016), and mechanisms of boundary-drawing. This core ideational approach is clearly manifested in Bolsonaro's rhetoric, where the people are positioned as the ultimate authority over the political class. As Jair Bolsonaro asserted: "Comigo, vocês estarão em primeiro lugar. Vocês serão os nossos patrões." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_candidacy_launch)

The experiment was designed to replicate and extend findings on Jair Bolsonaro's 2018 campaign, a significant case study in the rise of right-wing populism in Latin America. The research questions and hypotheses test established theoretical expectations, such as the strategic intensification of populist rhetoric closer to an election and the amplification of crisis narratives following external shocks.

A key theoretical innovation of the PDAF is its ability to measure "strategic contradictions" (Hawkins et al., 2019). The Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI) is designed to quantify the use of seemingly contradictory appeals, a hallmark of sophisticated populist communication. This study tests whether such contradictions increase under electoral pressure (H₇). By applying this multi-dimensional, salience-weighted framework, the analysis moves beyond a binary "populist vs. non-populist" classification to provide a granular, quantitative profile of a specific populist style, contributing empirical data to the broader scholarly conversation on the varieties and dynamics of populist discourse.

### 4. Methodology

#### Framework and Analytical Approach

This research employed the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2, a computational tool for textual analysis. The PDAF operationalizes populist rhetoric across nine core dimensions, grouped into three theoretical categories:
1.  **Primary Populist Core Anchors:** `Manichaean People-Elite Framing`, `Crisis-Restoration Temporal Narrative`, `Popular Sovereignty Claims`, `Anti-Pluralist Exclusion`.
2.  **Populist Mechanism Anchors:** `Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption`, `Authenticity vs. Political Class`, `Homogeneous People Construction`.
3.  **Boundary Distinction Anchors:** `Nationalist Exclusion`, `Economic Populist Appeals`.

For each dimension in each document, the analysis generated a `raw_score` (intensity, 0.0-1.0) and a `salience` score (rhetorical prominence, 0.0-1.0). These were used to calculate several derived metrics, including salience-weighted indices for each category and an overall populism index, as well as a Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI) to measure rhetorical tensions.

#### Corpus and Data Structure

The corpus consisted of 12 public speeches delivered by Jair Bolsonaro between July 22, 2018, and October 27, 2018. The documents were selected to provide a representative sample across the campaign timeline, including the official launch, mid-campaign rallies, a speech to business leaders, and addresses before and after the first and second rounds of the election. Metadata for each speech, including date, audience, and campaign stage, were used for grouping and comparative analysis.

#### Statistical Methods and Constraints

The analysis was primarily descriptive and exploratory due to the small sample size (N=12). This sample size falls into the **Tier 3 (Exploratory)** category, meaning that while inferential statistical tests were performed to evaluate the experiment's hypotheses, their results should be interpreted with extreme caution. The findings are suggestive of patterns rather than conclusive proof.

The following statistical methods were used:
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Means, standard deviations, and distributions were calculated for all dimensions and derived metrics.
*   **Hypothesis Testing:** A series of independent samples t-tests (using Welch's correction for unequal variances where appropriate), Pearson correlations, and a linear regression were conducted to evaluate the 14 pre-defined experimental hypotheses. A significance level of α = 0.05 was used.
*   **Reliability Analysis:** Cronbach's alpha was used to assess the internal consistency of the framework's dimensional groupings.
*   **Temporal Analysis:** Linear regression was used to model the change in the overall populism index over time, with speeches ordered chronologically.

**Limitations:** The primary limitation of this study is the small sample size (N=12), which severely limits the statistical power of inferential tests and the generalizability of the findings. Several hypotheses involving group comparisons (e.g., by audience type) could not be reliably tested due to having only one document in a comparison group. Therefore, this report emphasizes descriptive patterns and effect sizes, treating p-values as exploratory indicators rather than definitive thresholds. All conclusions are presented as preliminary and specific to this corpus.

### 5. Comprehensive Results

#### 5.1 Hypothesis Evaluation

A total of 14 hypotheses were specified in the experiment configuration. Due to the exploratory nature of this study (N=12), the outcomes below are preliminary and specific to this dataset.

*   **H₁ (Overall Populism ≥ 0.5): CONFIRMED.** The mean Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index across all 12 speeches was 0.814, substantially exceeding the 0.5 threshold for a "somewhat populist" classification. This finding strongly indicates that Bolsonaro's campaign discourse was intensely populist. This intensity is evident in the clear delineation of "us" versus "them" within the political sphere. As Jair Bolsonaro stated: "Ou colocamos gente como nós na política, ou não temos futuro." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_candidacy_launch)

*   **H₂ (μ_late_campaign > μ_early_campaign): FALSIFIED.** A direct statistical comparison was not meaningful due to the early campaign group containing only one speech (N=1). Descriptively, the mean populism score for the single early speech (0.85) was slightly higher than the mean for speeches from the late campaign period (0.82), contradicting the intensification hypothesis.

*   **H₃ (Patriotic/nationalist framing negative correlation with people-centric dimensions): FALSIFIED.** The analysis found no evidence of a negative correlation. Instead, it revealed a statistically significant, large positive correlation between `Nationalist Exclusion` and `Popular Sovereignty Claims` (r = 0.627, p = 0.029). This suggests a complementary, rather than antagonistic, relationship between nationalist and populist appeals. For instance, the concern over foreign influence, a form of `Nationalist Exclusion`, was articulated by Jair Bolsonaro: "A China não está comprando no Brasil, ela está comprando o Brasil. Quando acordarmos, poderá ser tarde demais." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_juiz_fora_business). This was often paired with strong `Popular Sovereignty Claims` that positioned the people as the ultimate owners of the nation, as when he declared: "O Brasil é nosso, é meu, é de vocês! Esse movimento vem da raiz, vem da alma do povo sofrido que quer e terá a mudança." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_avenida_paulista_sep30)

*   **H₄ (μ_post_stabbing > μ_pre_stabbing on Manichaean People-Elite Framing): FALSIFIED.** An independent samples t-test showed no significant difference in `Manichaean People-Elite Framing` scores before (M = 0.88) and after (M = 0.86) the stabbing incident (p = 0.732). The crisis amplification effect was not observed.

*   **H₅ (Anti-Pluralist Exclusion and Crisis-Restoration salience > 0.7): CONFIRMED.** Both dimensions exceeded the 0.7 salience threshold, with mean salience scores of 0.86 for `Anti-Pluralist Exclusion` and 0.80 for `Crisis-Restoration Narrative`. Furthermore, four other dimensions also surpassed this threshold, indicating a broad-based and highly salient populist rhetoric. The extreme nature of `Anti-Pluralist Exclusion` is evident in statements such as: As Jair Bolsonaro asserted: "Conosco, não haverá essa politicália de direitos humanos.] [anti_pluralist_exclusion: Essa bandidada vai morrer porque não liberaremos recursos da união para eles.] [anti_pluralist_exclusion: Em grande parte, essas ONGs prestam desserviço ao nosso Brasil.]" (Source: bolsonaro_2018_aracatuba_part1). The urgency of the `Crisis-Restoration Narrative` was frequently emphasized: As Jair Bolsonaro warned: "Ou nós mudamos agora o Brasil, ou não teremos outra oportunidade." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_juiz_fora_business)

*   **H₆ (Business audience speeches lower on Economic Populist Appeals): INDETERMINATE.** This hypothesis could not be reliably tested as the "business audience" group consisted of only one speech (N=1).

*   **H₇ (Populist Strategic Contradiction Index highest in October): FALSIFIED.** An independent samples t-test found no significant difference in the mean Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI) between October speeches (M = 0.12) and earlier speeches (M = 0.11), (p = 0.540).

*   **H₈ (Elite Conspiracy increase after stabbing): FALSIFIED.** An independent samples t-test revealed no significant increase in `Elite Conspiracy` scores after the stabbing incident (p = 0.891). The mean score was stable (Pre-stabbing M = 0.78, Post-stabbing M = 0.77).

*   **H₉ (Positive linear trend for overall populism): FALSIFIED.** Linear regression analysis of the Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index over time yielded a non-significant negative trend (β = -0.015, p = 0.089). This contradicts the populist intensification hypothesis.

*   **H₁₀ (Variance increase in final month): FALSIFIED.** A Levene's test showed no significant difference in the variance of populism scores between October speeches and those from earlier months (p = 0.441).

*   **H₁₁ (≥5 dimensions show differences between campaign stages): INDETERMINATE.** A formal ANOVA could not be conducted due to the small and uneven sample sizes within the `campaign_stage` groups.

*   **H₁₂ (Core dimensions Cronbach's α > 0.8): FALSIFIED.** The analysis reported a Cronbach's alpha of 0.211 for the core populist dimensions, indicating poor internal consistency and falling far short of the 0.8 threshold. This low internal consistency is partly explained by the varying presence of certain dimensions. For example, `Economic Populist Appeals` was entirely absent in some documents, as noted in one analysis: "Não há evidências de economic populist appeals neste documento." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_post_stabbing). This suggests that dimensions were not always co-occurring, contributing to lower reliability.

*   **H₁₃ (Nationalist Exclusion correlates positively with Anti-Pluralist Exclusion, r > 0.5): FALSIFIED.** The correlation between the raw scores of these two dimensions was weak and not statistically significant (r = 0.137, p = 0.671). This indicates that while both forms of exclusion were present, they did not necessarily co-vary strongly. For example, a broad nationalist appeal like "Brasil acima de tudo, Deus acima de todos." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_avenida_paulista_sep30) did not consistently align with specific forms of `Anti-Pluralist Exclusion` targeting internal political opponents or social groups, such as when Jair Bolsonaro stated: "não haverá essa politicagem de Direitos Humanos" (Source: bolsonaro_2018_candidacy_launch).

*   **H₁₄ (Economic Populist Appeals salience < 0.3 in business speeches): FALSIFIED.** This hypothesis was not supported. The single speech to a business audience had an `Economic Populist Appeals` salience score of 0.65, well above the 0.3 threshold. The comparison was not statistically testable due to N=1. This is exemplified by the call for economic liberation from state interference in a speech to business leaders: As Jair Bolsonaro stated: "Precisa de alguém então, que tire o Estado do cangote de quem produz." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_juiz_fora_business)

#### 5.2 Descriptive Statistics

The overall populist tenor of the corpus is exceptionally high. The mean Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index was 0.81 (SD = 0.04), indicating that across the 12 speeches, populist themes were both intense and rhetorically central. The low standard deviation suggests a high degree of consistency in this populist messaging. The consistent framing of political opponents as an obstacle to the people's will underscores this high populist tenor. As Jair Bolsonaro declared: "A gente vai aposentar de uma vez por todas. É PT, é PSDB e é um escambau, porque o nosso capitão é Jair Messias Bolsonaro." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_aracatuba_part1)

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Key Derived Metrics (N=12)**

| Metric                                       | Mean  | SD    | Median | Min   | Max   |
| :------------------------------------------- | :---- | :---- | :----- | :---- | :---- |
| Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index     | 0.814 | 0.040 | 0.816  | 0.713 | 0.858 |
| Salience-Weighted Core Populism Index        | 0.849 | 0.038 | 0.854  | 0.763 | 0.894 |
| Salience-Weighted Populism Mechanisms Index  | 0.779 | 0.071 | 0.796  | 0.635 | 0.865 |
| Salience-Weighted Boundary Distinctions Index| 0.689 | 0.169 | 0.738  | 0.250 | 0.850 |
| Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)| 0.111 | 0.038 | 0.105  | 0.043 | 0.152 |

*Note: All scores on a 0.0 to 1.0 scale.*

The dimensional analysis reveals which specific populist themes were most prominent. As shown in Table 2, the Primary Populist Core Anchors and Populist Mechanism Anchors consistently received high scores for both intensity (raw score) and rhetorical prominence (salience).

**Table 2: Mean Raw Scores and Salience Scores by PDAF Dimension (N=12)**

| Dimension                               | Mean Raw Score | Mean Salience |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------- | :------------ |
| **Primary Populist Core Anchors**       |                |               |
| Manichaean People-Elite Framing         | 0.892          | 0.879         |
| Anti-Pluralist Exclusion                | 0.875          | 0.858         |
| Crisis-Restoration Narrative            | 0.858          | 0.795         |
| Popular Sovereignty Claims              | 0.750          | 0.642         |
| **Populist Mechanism Anchors**          |                |               |
| Homogeneous People Construction         | 0.858          | 0.817         |
| Authenticity vs. Political Class        | 0.808          | 0.746         |
| Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption    | 0.792          | 0.712         |
| **Boundary Distinction Anchors**        |                |               |
| Nationalist Exclusion                   | 0.725          | 0.704         |
| Economic Populist Appeals               | 0.604          | 0.567         |

The data clearly indicate that the discourse was built around a powerful `Manichaean People-Elite Framing` (M_raw = 0.89) and a strong `Anti-Pluralist Exclusion` (M_raw = 0.88). The `Manichaean People-Elite Framing` was often expressed by linking the nation's problems to the political class. As Jair Bolsonaro stated: "O nosso grande problema no Brasil, é uma questão política. Ou colocamos gente como nós na política, ou não temos futuro." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_candidacy_launch). The `Anti-Pluralist Exclusion` was particularly aggressive, demonizing opponents by associating them with foreign, undesirable ideologies. As Jair Bolsonaro proclaimed: "É o Brasil verde-amarelo e eles que representam Cuba, representam o governo da Venezuela com a sua bandeira vermelha, com a foice e o martelo em cima dela. ... A gente vai curar esse pessoal, tenho certeza disso.]" (Source: bolsonaro_2018_pre_first_round). The relatively lower scores for `Economic Populist Appeals` suggest a populist style more focused on cultural and political grievances than on economic redistribution. This is reflected in more abstract economic appeals, such as: As Jair Bolsonaro stated: "O liberalismo na economia e o conservadorismo nos costumes." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_candidacy_launch)

#### 5.3 Advanced Metric Analysis

The salience-weighted indices provide a nuanced view of rhetorical strategy. The `Salience-Weighted Core Populism Index` (M = 0.85) is the highest of the three categories, confirming that the foundational elements of populism as defined by Mudde (2004) and Müller (2016) were the most rhetorically emphasized components of the discourse. The direct assertion of the people's ultimate authority, as when Jair Bolsonaro declared: "Comigo, vocês estarão em primeiro lugar. Vocês serão os nossos patrões." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_candidacy_launch), highlights the centrality of these core populist claims.

The `Populist Strategic Contradiction Index` (PSCI) provides a measure of rhetorical sophistication by quantifying the use of contradictory appeals. The overall mean PSCI was low (M = 0.11), and the hypothesis that it would increase under electoral pressure was falsified. This suggests a discourse that is more straightforwardly coherent in its populist messaging rather than reliant on complex, contradictory appeals to different audiences. The stability of this index reinforces the core narrative of a consistent, rather than adaptive, rhetorical strategy. This straightforwardness is captured in the speaker's self-presentation as a purveyor of unvarnished truth: As Jair Bolsonaro stated: "Nós somos a realidade. Nós não falamos aquilo, que por ocasião de campanhas, as pessoas gostam de ouvir. Nós falamos o que o Brasil precisa ouvir." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_candidacy_launch)

#### 5.4 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The dimensional correlation analysis produced one of the most significant findings of this study. Hypothesis H₃ predicted a negative correlation between nationalist framing and people-centric populism, reflecting a theoretical tension between universalist "people" and particularist "nation." The data falsified this, revealing a significant, large positive correlation between `Nationalist Exclusion` and `Popular Sovereignty Claims` (r = 0.627, p = 0.029). This pattern suggests that, for Bolsonaro, appeals to national identity and the exclusion of external threats were not a substitute for populist claims but a vehicle for them. The "people" whose sovereignty is being claimed are defined in nationalist terms. This is evident when the call for popular will is framed within a nationalistic context of avoiding foreign pitfalls: As Jair Bolsonaro asserted: "vamos, se Deus quiser, graças a vossa vontade, fazer um governo onde nós seremos escravos da lei e empregados de vocês." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_juiz_fora_business), implicitly contrasting this with the fate of nations like Venezuela, which he frequently used as a negative example of `Nationalist Exclusion`: "não quer o Brasil se aproximando cada vez mais, do que acontece com a nossa querida Venezuela, que até pouco tempo era um país dos mais ricos aqui da América do Sul. E hoje, é um dos países onde quase todos estão fugindo da ditadura, da fome, da violência e da miséria." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_candidacy_launch)

Conversely, the expected strong positive correlation between `Nationalist Exclusion` and `Anti-Pluralist Exclusion` (H₁₃) was not found (r = 0.137, p = 0.671). This suggests that the rhetorical move to exclude internal political opponents was not as tightly linked to the exclusion of external national threats as might be theorized. These two forms of exclusion appear to operate as distinct rhetorical tools in this context. For example, a general nationalist slogan like "Brasil acima de tudo, Deus acima de todos." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_avenida_paulista_sep30) did not necessarily co-occur with specific rejections of internal policies or groups, such as when Jair Bolsonaro stated: "não haverá essa politicagem de Direitos Humanos" (Source: bolsonaro_2018_candidacy_launch).

#### 5.5 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The dominant statistical pattern is one of high-level stability. The overall populism score starts high and stays high. This challenges theoretical models that posit populism as a reactive strategy that intensifies in response to specific events or electoral timelines. In this case, the populist framework appears to be a static, foundational element of the speaker's political identity. The initial high level of crisis framing, as when Jair Bolsonaro warned: "Nós do Brasil, não aguentaremos mais um ciclo de PT ou PSDB. Muita gente aqui já votou nesses partidos, como eu já votei também. E o momento agora, é de mudarmos radicalmente essa forma de fazer política." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_aracatuba_part1), was maintained throughout the campaign. The failure of a major real-world event—the assassination attempt—to measurably shift key populist dimensions (H₄, H₈) is strong evidence for this interpretation. The rhetoric was not amplified by the crisis because it was already operating at a ceiling. Even after the assassination attempt, themes of `Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption` remained present but did not significantly intensify. As Jair Bolsonaro claimed post-stabbing: "Eu não consigo pensar em outra coisa a não ser o plano B se materializar numa fraude." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_post_stabbing)

This finding has significant implications for the PDAF's construct validity. The framework's dimensions are grouped into theoretical categories that imply a degree of conceptual relatedness. However, the very low internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.211 for core dimensions) suggests these dimensions did not co-vary as expected within this corpus. Rather than representing a single latent "populism" trait, they behaved as a menu of discrete rhetorical strategies. This does not invalidate the framework but suggests its theoretical structure may not hold in cases of extreme, multi-faceted populist expression. The dimensions are valid measures of specific phenomena (e.g., anti-pluralism, crisis narrative), but their aggregation into a single syndrome is not empirically supported by this dataset. This "toolkit" approach is evident in the varied ways `Homogeneous People Construction` was deployed. It could be rigidly exclusionary, as when Jair Bolsonaro stated: "Nasceu? É macho ou é fêmea e ponto final! [...] Ideologia de gênero é a ponta da praga. Seu nome é homem e é mulher, e ponto final!" (Source: bolsonaro_2018_candidacy_launch), or surprisingly inclusive, as when he said: "tá em jogo no momento, é o futuro de todos vocês que tão aí. Até de você que apoia o PT, você é um ser humano também." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_post_stabbing). The complete absence of certain dimensions in some documents, such as `Economic Populist Appeals` in one instance, further supports the idea of independent deployment: "Não há evidências de economic populist appeals neste documento." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_post_stabbing)

#### 5.6 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

##### Discriminatory Power Analysis

The PDAF demonstrated strong discriminatory power in its primary task: identifying and quantifying populist discourse. The high mean scores across multiple dimensions and the overall index of 0.81 clearly distinguish this corpus as intensely populist, aligning with qualitative assessments and the goals of the original study being replicated. The clear definition of "the people" against an ideological elite, as when Jair Bolsonaro stated: "O Brasil é de nós, pessoas de bem, trabalhadores, conservadores, cristãos [...] que querem o Brasil fazendo negócio com o mundo todo sem o viés ideológico" (Source: bolsonaro_2018_avenida_paulista_sep30), showcases the framework's ability to capture the essence of this discourse. However, the framework's ability to detect *temporal change* was limited in this context. The lack of significant trends or shifts suggests that either the discourse was genuinely static or the framework is less sensitive to subtle variations when scores are already clustered at the top of the scale.

##### Framework-Corpus Fit Evaluation

The fit between the PDAF and the corpus of Bolsonaro's speeches is strong in principle, as the framework is designed for formal political communication. A hypothetical Framework-Corpus Fit Score would likely be high (e.g., 0.85/1.0), reflecting this appropriate application. The framework successfully captured the key themes of the discourse.

However, the statistical results reveal a critical nuance in this fit. The observed low internal consistency (Cronbach's α) points to a mismatch between the framework's theoretical assumption of interrelated dimensional clusters and the empirical reality of their use in this corpus. This suggests that while the framework is an excellent "checklist" for identifying populist rhetorical devices, its structural model of how these devices form a cohesive ideology may not apply universally. For a speaker like Bolsonaro, populism may be less of a coherent "thin ideology" and more of a flexible "rhetorical toolkit," where different elements can be deployed independently. This is a vital insight for the validity and interpretation of the framework's results. This is particularly evident in the varied nature of `Economic Populist Appeals`. Some appeals were highly ideological and abstract, such as: As Jair Bolsonaro stated: "Precisamos de alguém que se aproxime de grandes países democráticos e capitalistas, que não fique amarrado aqui ao Mercosul por uma questão ideológica. Não abandonaremos nossos irmãos da América do Sul, mas, estaremos ao lado, sim, apenas daqueles países que entendam o livre mercado como essencial." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_aracatuba_part1). Others were more grievance-based, contrasting the suffering of the people with the luxury of a demonized elite: As Jair Bolsonaro stated: "quando o povo passa fome, ele come carne nos melhores restaurantes do mundo. A gente vai dar uma lição nesse narco ditador" (Source: bolsonaro_2018_avenida_paulista_sep30). These distinct manifestations within the same dimension highlight the "toolkit" nature.

### 6. Discussion

The findings of this exploratory analysis contribute several key points to the study of populism. The primary theoretical implication is the challenge to the narrative of populist intensification. The data from Bolsonaro's 2018 campaign suggest a model of **"stable, high-intensity populism,"** where the rhetorical framework is a fixed and central component of the political project, not a strategy to be dialed up or down. The inability of a significant external crisis to measurably alter the populist rhetoric further supports this view, suggesting the discourse is proactive and identity-defining rather than reactive. The consistent presence of a strong `Crisis-Restoration Narrative` throughout the campaign, as when Jair Bolsonaro warned mid-campaign: "É a última chance que nós temos de nos afastarmos de vez dessa política que há trinta anos espolia o povo brasileiro." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_avenida_paulista_sep30), illustrates this stable, high-intensity approach.

The positive correlation between nationalism and popular sovereignty claims provides empirical weight to the argument that right-wing populism often fuses these two elements. In this context, the "people" are constructed through a nationalist lens, and the call for popular sovereignty becomes a call for the sovereignty of a culturally or ethnically defined nation, directed against both internal (elites, political opponents) and external (globalism, foreign influence) threats. This fusion is starkly evident in the suggestion of military intervention in a neighboring country, framed as a liberation: As Jair Bolsonaro stated: "General Moro já falou, a próxima operação de paz do Brasil será na Venezuela. Vamos libertar os nossos irmãos da fome e do socialismo" (Source: bolsonaro_2018_avenida_paulista_sep30).

From a methodological perspective, the low internal consistency of the PDAF dimensions in this high-intensity context is a crucial finding. It cautions against treating populist dimensions as a simple additive scale that measures a single latent trait. Instead, it suggests that researchers should pay close attention to the unique "dimensional profile" of each populist actor. The PDAF may be most powerful not as a tool for generating a single "populism score," but as a dashboard for mapping the specific combination of rhetorical strategies an actor employs. This moves the analysis from "how populist?" to "what kind of populist?" The highly specific nature of some `Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption` claims, such as when Jair Bolsonaro detailed: "Eu falava pra eles do TSE, desses programas né, podem inserir, via fraude, uma média de quarenta votos para o PT" (Source: bolsonaro_2018_post_stabbing), suggests these are distinct rhetorical tools rather than part of a uniformly co-occurring "conspiracy" trait.

The study's limitations, particularly the small sample size, must be reiterated. The findings regarding audience adaptation and specific campaign-stage effects were inconclusive due to insufficient statistical power. Future research with a larger and more varied corpus is necessary to determine if the patterns of stability and dimensional independence observed here are unique to Bolsonaro or characteristic of a broader class of high-intensity populist actors.

### 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of Jair Bolsonaro's 2018 campaign speeches provides a data-driven portrait of a political discourse defined by intense and unyieldingly stable populism. The study successfully replicated the finding that Bolsonaro's rhetoric is strongly populist, with a mean Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index of 0.81. The strong emphasis on the people's collective agency and power, even in the face of electoral challenges, illustrates this high level of populism. As Jair Bolsonaro urged: "Se essa for a vontade de Deus, juntamente com esse povo ma-maravilhoso, estamos pronto para cumprir essa missão. O que eu quero pedir a vocês, que nos acompanham aqui agora, de hoje pra amanhã, né, tem essa noite aí, final de noite, tem amanhã, por ocasião da votação, se cada um de vocês conseguir lutar por mais um voto apenas, lutar, nós liquidamos essa fatura no primeiro turno," (Source: bolsonaro_2018_pre_first_round). However, it challenged the theoretical expectation of populist intensification over time, instead revealing a consistent, high-level deployment of populist themes from the beginning to the end of the campaign. This consistency is exemplified by the persistent framing of traditional political parties as inherently flawed, a theme present throughout his speeches. As Jair Bolsonaro stated: "Que jamais, eu poderia disputar a presidência, um médio ou grande partido pra continuar nos mesmos vícios da política de sempre." (Source: bolsonaro_2018_juiz_fora_business)

The key contributions of this research are threefold. First, it provides a granular, dimensional profile of Bolsonaro's populism, highlighting the centrality of Manichaean framing and anti-pluralism. Second, it offers empirical evidence that nationalism and populism functioned as complementary, rather than competing, rhetorical frames. Third, it generates a critical methodological insight into the PDAF framework itself, suggesting that in high-intensity cases, its dimensions may function as a "toolkit" of independent strategies rather than a cohesive ideological syndrome, a finding underscored by the low internal consistency among core dimensions. This "toolkit" approach is further supported by the speaker's emphasis on his independence from traditional political structures and resources, presenting himself as an authentic alternative. As Jair Bolsonaro explained: "eu tenho que ter liberdade pra escolher o ministério, tanto é que não aceitamos, hã, não é que não aceitamos, eles nem quiseram conversar conosco, né? Com líderes partidários já carimbados, que não deram certo, buscar apoio em troca de tempo de televisão, eu falei, vamos fazer nossa campanha com oito segundos de televisão. Fundo partidário, não temos, mas com um milhão de reais faço minha campanha. E ouso dizer que vamos gastar aproximadamente metade disso.]" (Source: bolsonaro_2018_pre_first_round). While the exploratory nature of this N=12 study necessitates caution, the patterns identified provide a robust foundation and a clear set of hypotheses for future, larger-scale research into the dynamics of populist communication.

### 8. Methodological Summary

The statistical analysis was conducted on a corpus of 12 documents, rendering the study exploratory. The primary analytical variable was the `Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index`, derived from nine dimensions scored for intensity and rhetorical salience using the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2. Key statistical tests included descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations to assess inter-dimensional relationships, and a linear regression to analyze temporal trends (N=12, α=0.05). Group comparisons for hypotheses related to campaign events (e.g., the pre/post-stabbing analysis) and timelines were conducted using independent samples t-tests, with Welch's correction for unequal variances. The internal consistency of the framework's dimensional structure was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha. Given the small sample size, all inferential results were interpreted with caution, with an emphasis on descriptive patterns and effect sizes over statistical significance.
