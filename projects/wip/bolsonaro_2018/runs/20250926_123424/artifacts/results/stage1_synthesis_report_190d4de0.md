### 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of 12 speeches from Jair Bolsonaro's 2018 presidential campaign, utilizing the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2. The analysis was conducted on a preliminary, exploratory sample (N=12), and all findings should be interpreted as suggestive rather than conclusive. The central finding of this study is that Bolsonaro's campaign rhetoric, as measured by the PDAF, constitutes a form of **highly intense, structurally stable, and rhetorically coherent ethno-nationalist populism**. This data-driven characterization challenges several common theoretical assumptions about populist communication, particularly those concerning strategic adaptation, temporal intensification, and the use of contradictory messaging.

The statistical results indicate an exceptionally high and consistent level of populist content, with a mean Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index of 0.85 across the corpus. Contrary to the experiment's primary hypotheses, the analysis found no evidence of populist intensification as the election approached; instead, the rhetorical structure appeared fully formed and stable from the outset. Furthermore, the framework's novel strategic tension metrics revealed a surprisingly low degree of contradiction (mean Populist Strategic Contradiction Index = 0.09), suggesting a highly consistent and unambiguous message rather than the strategic deployment of conflicting appeals. This finding indicates that the PDAF's tension analysis, while designed to detect contradiction, can also serve to confirm its absence, thereby identifying rhetorically coherent populist styles.

The most significant pattern to emerge from the dimensional analysis is a powerful correlation cluster linking the construction of a homogeneous "people" with nationalist exclusion and the rejection of pluralism. Specifically, `homogeneous_people_construction` showed a very strong positive correlation with `nationalist_exclusion` (*r* = .82, *p* = .001), indicating that the definition of "the people" was intrinsically tied to the exclusion of external or cultural "others." This data-driven insight points to an ethno-nationalist, majoritarian populism as the central engine of the discourse. While the PDAF framework proved effective in identifying this core rhetorical strategy, its dimensional structure exhibited poor internal consistency (Cronbach’s α < 0.51), suggesting that its dimensions measure distinct, though related, rhetorical tools rather than a single latent construct of "populism."

### 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

This analysis of Jair Bolsonaro's 2018 campaign speeches, based on the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF), yields several key insights into the structure and nature of his rhetoric. Due to the small sample size (N=12), these insights are exploratory.

*   **Populist Rhetoric Was Intensely and Consistently Deployed:** The discourse registered an exceptionally high mean Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index of 0.85. This indicates that populist framing was not an occasional tactic but the fundamental, pervasive language of the campaign.
*   **Discourse Was Structurally Stable, Not Temporally Escalating:** Contrary to hypotheses predicting intensification (H₂, H₉), the analysis revealed no statistically significant increase in populism scores over the campaign timeline. The populist style appears to have been fully articulated from the start and remained stable, even after the September 6th stabbing incident.
*   **Rhetoric Was Coherent, Not Strategically Contradictory:** The framework’s innovative tension metrics registered consistently low scores (mean Populist Strategic Contradiction Index = 0.09). This suggests Bolsonaro’s messaging was highly coherent, directly challenging the hypothesis (H₇) that populist leaders rely on strategically ambiguous or contradictory appeals, especially under electoral pressure.
*   **Ethno-Nationalism Formed the Core of Populist Identity Construction:** The strongest statistical pattern was a tight, significant correlation between `homogeneous_people_construction` and `nationalist_exclusion` (*r* = .82, *p* = .001). This data-driven finding suggests that the primary mechanism for creating a unified "people" was through nationalist and cultural boundary-drawing, defining the ingroup by opposition to an externalized outgroup.
*   **Identity and Anti-Pluralism Outweighed Economic Appeals:** Dimensions related to identity and political structure, such as `manichaean_people_elite_framing` (mean salience = 0.90) and `anti_pluralist_exclusion` (mean salience = 0.86), were significantly more salient than `economic_populist_appeals` (mean salience = 0.58). This profile points to a populism animated more by cultural and political grievances than economic ones.
*   **Framework Dimensions Exhibited Poor Internal Consistency:** The PDAF's dimensional groupings showed poor internal reliability (Cronbach’s α for core dimensions = 0.26; for auxiliary = 0.51). This methodological finding suggests that the framework's dimensions, in this context, may be capturing distinct rhetorical tools rather than facets of a single underlying latent variable, a crucial insight for the theory and measurement of populism.

### 3. Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

This study is situated at the intersection of populism studies, political communication, and computational social science. The Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) is explicitly grounded in the "ideational approach" to populism, which defines it as a "thin-centered ideology" that pits a virtuous "people" against a corrupt "elite" (Mudde, 2004). The framework expands on this core by incorporating concepts of anti-pluralism (Müller, 2016), populist performance and style (Moffitt, 2016), and the construction of popular will (Urbinati, 2019).

A key theoretical innovation of the PDAF is its attempt to operationalize and measure "populist strategic contradictions" (Hawkins et al., 2019). This concept posits that populists may strategically deploy contradictory messages to appeal to diverse constituencies simultaneously. The framework's tension metrics (`democratic_authoritarian_tension`, `internal_external_focus_tension`, etc.) and the overall `Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)` are designed to quantify this phenomenon. This experiment, therefore, serves as an empirical test of this theoretical proposition within the context of Bolsonaro's 2018 campaign.

The experiment's hypotheses are derived from established theories of campaign dynamics. The temporal intensification hypotheses (H₂, H₉) draw from literature suggesting that populist appeals escalate closer to an election. Hypotheses on audience adaptation (H₆, H₁₄) test the "chameleon" model of populism, which suggests leaders moderate their message for different audiences. The analysis of the stabbing incident's impact (H₄, H₈) provides a natural experiment to test theories of crisis communication and victimization narratives in populist discourse. By applying the PDAF to a non-Western, Latin American context, this study also contributes to the comparative analysis of populism, testing the cross-cultural applicability of a framework developed primarily from North American and European models.

### 4. Methodology

#### Framework Description and Analytical Approach

This research employed the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2, a computational tool for textual analysis. The PDAF operationalizes populist rhetoric across nine core dimensions, grouped into three theoretical categories:
1.  **Primary Populist Core Anchors:** `manichaean_people_elite_framing`, `crisis_restoration_narrative`, `popular_sovereignty_claims`, `anti_pluralist_exclusion`.
2.  **Populist Mechanism Anchors:** `elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption`, `authenticity_vs_political_class`, `homogeneous_people_construction`.
3.  **Boundary Distinction Anchors:** `nationalist_exclusion`, `economic_populist_appeals`.

For each dimension, the analysis generated a `raw_score` (0.0-1.0) for intensity and a `salience` score (0.0-1.0) for rhetorical prominence. The framework's primary innovation lies in its derived metrics, including salience-weighted indices that account for rhetorical emphasis and strategic tension indices designed to measure contradictory messaging. The central outcome variables for this report are the `salience_weighted_overall_populism_index` and the `populist_strategic_contradiction_index`.

#### Data Structure and Corpus Description

The analysis was performed on a corpus of 12 speeches delivered by Jair Bolsonaro during his 2018 presidential campaign, from July 22 to October 27, 2018. The corpus includes speeches from different campaign phases, audience types (e.g., mass rallies, business leaders), and contexts (e.g., pre/post-assassination attempt). Metadata from the corpus manifest, including `campaign_stage`, `audience`, and `pre_post_stabbing`, were used for statistical grouping and hypothesis testing.

#### Statistical Methods and Analytical Constraints

Given the exploratory nature of this study and the small sample size (N=12), the statistical analysis prioritized descriptive statistics, effect sizes, and pattern recognition over conclusive inferential claims. The following methods were employed:

*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Means, standard deviations, and distributions were calculated for all dimensional scores and derived metrics to characterize the central tendencies of the discourse.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Pearson correlation coefficients (*r*) were computed to examine the relationships between PDAF dimensions and between metrics and temporal variables. This was the primary method for identifying structural patterns in the rhetoric.
*   **Group Comparisons:** Where hypotheses required comparing groups (e.g., pre- vs. post-stabbing, different audience types), independent samples t-tests were considered. However, due to extremely small group sizes (in some cases N=1), these tests lacked statistical power and were treated as descriptive comparisons of means.
*   **Reliability Analysis:** Cronbach's alpha (α) was calculated to assess the internal consistency of the PDAF's dimensional groupings.

**Analytical Limitations:** The primary limitation of this study is the small sample size (N=12), which severely restricts the statistical power of inferential tests and the generalizability of the findings. All results, particularly those related to hypothesis testing, should be considered preliminary and suggestive. P-values are reported for transparency but are interpreted with extreme caution. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns and effect sizes that may warrant further investigation with a larger corpus.

### 5. Comprehensive Results

#### 5.1 Hypothesis Evaluation

A total of 14 hypotheses were specified in the experiment configuration. Each was evaluated against the statistical data. Due to the exploratory sample size (N=12), outcomes are presented with the caveat that they are suggestive and require further validation.

**Primary Hypotheses (Replicating Original Study)**

*   **H₁ (Overall Populism ≥ 0.5): CONFIRMED.** The mean Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index across all 12 speeches was 0.85, with a standard deviation of 0.06. This value is substantially and significantly greater than the 0.5 threshold, confirming a highly populist characterization of the discourse.

*   **H₂ (μ\_late\_campaign > μ\_early\_campaign): FALSIFIED.** A descriptive comparison of means does not support this hypothesis. The single "early_campaign" speech had a score of 0.81, while the mean of the "late_campaign" and "final_hours" speeches (n=3) was 0.81. There is no evidence of temporal intensification in the overall populism score.

*   **H₃ (Patriotic/nationalist framing negative correlation with people-centric dimensions): FALSIFIED.** The hypothesis predicted a negative correlation (*r* < -0.3). The data shows the opposite. The correlation between `nationalist_exclusion` and `homogeneous_people_construction` was strong, positive, and statistically significant (*r* = .82, *p* = .001). The correlation with `popular_sovereignty_claims` was also positive and notable (*r* = .64, *p* = .024). This finding directly contradicts the hypothesis, suggesting a synergistic, rather than antagonistic, relationship.

**Secondary Hypotheses (Extending Original Study)**

*   **H₄ (μ\_post\_stabbing > μ\_pre\_stabbing on Manichaean Framing): FALSIFIED.** The mean raw score for `manichaean_people_elite_framing` was 0.90 both before and after the stabbing incident. The score was already at a ceiling, leaving no room for increase.

*   **H₅ (Anti-Pluralist & Crisis-Restoration highest salience > 0.7): CONFIRMED.** The mean salience for `anti_pluralist_exclusion` was 0.86 and for `crisis_restoration_narrative` was 0.80. Both are well above the 0.7 threshold. In fact, `manichaean_people_elite_framing` had the highest mean salience of all dimensions (0.90).

*   **H₆ (Business audience lower on Economic Populist Appeals): INDETERMINATE.** This hypothesis could not be reliably tested as there was only one speech to a business audience (N=1). Descriptively, this single speech had a raw score for `economic_populist_appeals` of 0.7, which was higher than the mean for speeches to "mass_public" audiences (M=0.60, n=2). The available data contradicts the hypothesis, but no statistical conclusion can be drawn.

*   **H₇ (Populist Strategic Contradiction Index highest in October): FALSIFIED.** The mean `populist_strategic_contradiction_index` for speeches in October (M = 0.08) was lower than the mean for speeches in the preceding months (M = 0.09). There is no evidence of increased strategic contradiction closer to the election.

*   **H₈ (Elite Conspiracy increase after stabbing): FALSIFIED.** While the mean raw score for `elite_conspiracy_systemic_corruption` was slightly higher in the post-stabbing period (M = 0.81) compared to the pre-stabbing period (M = 0.70), this difference was not statistically significant given the sample size (*t*(10) = -1.21, *p* = .25).

**Temporal Evolution Hypotheses**

*   **H₉ (Positive linear trend for overall populism): FALSIFIED.** A linear regression of `salience_weighted_overall_populism_index` against time (days from first speech) showed a negligible, non-significant slope (β = -0.0001, *p* = .95). This confirms the lack of temporal intensification.

*   **H₁₀ (Variance increase in final campaign month): FALSIFIED.** The variance of the `salience_weighted_overall_populism_index` was lower in October (Var = 0.002) than in the preceding months (Var = 0.006). A Levene's test confirmed no significant difference in variances (*W* = 0.81, *p* = .39).

*   **H₁₁ (≥5 dimensions differ by campaign stage): INDETERMINATE.** Due to the small and uneven sample sizes across the eight `campaign_stage` groups (some with N=1), a meaningful ANOVA could not be performed. The analysis lacks the statistical power to test this hypothesis.

**Dimensional Pattern Hypotheses**

*   **H₁₂ (Core dimensions more consistent than auxiliary): FALSIFIED.** The internal consistency for the four core populist dimensions was extremely low (Cronbach’s α = 0.26). The consistency for the five auxiliary dimensions was also poor, though slightly higher (Cronbach’s α = 0.51). Neither approached the α > 0.8 threshold, and the core dimensions were less consistent than the auxiliary ones.

*   **H₁₃ (Nationalist Exclusion correlates positively with Anti-Pluralist Exclusion, r > 0.5): FALSIFIED.** The observed correlation between the raw scores of `nationalist_exclusion` and `anti_pluralist_exclusion` was positive but weak and not statistically significant (*r* = .39, *p* = .21). It did not meet the *r* > 0.5 criterion.

*   **H₁₄ (Economic Populist Appeals lowest salience in business speeches < 0.3): FALSIFIED.** The salience score for `economic_populist_appeals` in the single speech to business leaders was 0.7, which is substantially higher than the 0.3 threshold.

#### 5.2 Descriptive Statistics

The analysis of 12 documents yielded consistently high populism scores. The mean Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index was 0.85 (*SD* = 0.06), indicating that populist rhetoric was a dominant and central feature of the discourse.

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Derived Populism Indices (N=12)**

| Metric                                         | Mean | Median | Std. Dev. | Min  | Max  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------ | --------- | ---- | ---- |
| Salience-Weighted Overall Populism Index       | 0.85 | 0.84   | 0.06      | 0.74 | 0.96 |
| Salience-Weighted Core Populism Index          | 0.85 | 0.85   | 0.03      | 0.81 | 0.88 |
| Salience-Weighted Populism Mechanisms Index    | 0.82 | 0.83   | 0.06      | 0.73 | 0.90 |
| Salience-Weighted Boundary Distinctions Index  | 0.74 | 0.75   | 0.14      | 0.36 | 0.88 |
| Populist Strategic Contradiction Index (PSCI)  | 0.09 | 0.09   | 0.02      | 0.05 | 0.11 |

*Note: All scores on a 0.0-1.0 scale.*

The three sub-indices (Core, Mechanisms, Boundary) all show high mean scores, suggesting a comprehensive populist style. The `salience_weighted_boundary_distinctions_index` has the lowest mean (0.74) and the highest standard deviation (0.14), driven by lower scores on `economic_populist_appeals`. The `populist_strategic_contradiction_index` is notably low, indicating high rhetorical consistency.

Analysis of the nine base dimensions reveals a clear hierarchy of rhetorical emphasis.

**Table 2: Descriptive Statistics for PDAF Dimensions (Raw Score and Salience, N=12)**

| Dimension                               | Mean Raw Score | Mean Salience |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Manichaean People-Elite Framing         | 0.90           | 0.90          |
| Anti-Pluralist Exclusion                | 0.90           | 0.86          |
| Homogeneous People Construction         | 0.85           | 0.79          |
| Crisis-Restoration Narrative            | 0.82           | 0.80          |
| Authenticity vs. Political Class        | 0.80           | 0.78          |
| Nationalist Exclusion                   | 0.78           | 0.73          |
| Elite Conspiracy/Systemic Corruption    | 0.76           | 0.70          |
| Popular Sovereignty Claims              | 0.75           | 0.71          |
| Economic Populist Appeals               | 0.65           | 0.58          |

*Note: All scores on a 0.0-1.0 scale.*

The data shows that `manichaean_people_elite_framing` and `anti_pluralist_exclusion` are the most intense and salient dimensions, forming the bedrock of the populist appeal. In contrast, `economic_populist_appeals` is the least prominent dimension, suggesting a populism animated more by cultural and political antagonism than by economic grievance.

#### 5.3 Advanced Metric Analysis

The PDAF's derived metrics provide deeper insights into the strategic nature of the discourse. The most striking finding comes from the `populist_strategic_contradiction_index` (PSCI). The framework's theoretical foundation posits that populists may use "strategic contradictions" to build broad coalitions. The PSCI is designed to measure this by quantifying the tension between pairs of theoretically opposed dimensions (e.g., claiming popular sovereignty while rejecting pluralism).

In this corpus, the mean PSCI was exceptionally low at 0.09 (*SD* = 0.02). A low score indicates that when two potentially contradictory dimensions were invoked, they were expressed with similar levels of rhetorical salience, minimizing the calculated tension. This pattern suggests that, rather than employing strategic ambiguity, Bolsonaro's discourse was characterized by a high degree of rhetorical coherence. The different populist appeals were presented as a consistent, mutually reinforcing package. This finding challenges the universality of the "strategic contradiction" model of populism and demonstrates the PDAF's utility in identifying not only contradictory styles but also highly coherent ones.

#### 5.4 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

Correlation analysis of the nine PDAF dimensions reveals the underlying structure of Bolsonaro's populist rhetoric. The analysis was performed on the raw scores across the 12 documents. The most significant findings emerge from a cluster of strongly inter-correlated dimensions related to identity and sovereignty.

**Table 3: Pearson Correlation Matrix for Key PDAF Dimensions (Raw Scores, N=12)**

| Dimension                               | 1. | 2. | 3. | 4. |
| --------------------------------------- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1. Homogeneous People Construction      | -  |    |    |    |
| 2. Nationalist Exclusion                | .82** | -  |    |    |
| 3. Popular Sovereignty Claims           | .67* | .64* | -  |    |
| 4. Authenticity vs. Political Class     | .55 | .69* | .46 | -  |

*Note: * *p* < .05, ** *p* < .01. Due to the small sample size, significance should be interpreted with caution.*

The matrix reveals a powerful rhetorical synergy. The very strong and significant correlation between `homogeneous_people_construction` and `nationalist_exclusion` (*r* = .82, *p* = .001) is the central finding. It statistically demonstrates that the construction of a unified "people" in this discourse is inextricably linked to the drawing of nationalist boundaries and the exclusion of "others."

This ethno-nationalist core is further linked to a majoritarian vision of power. Both `homogeneous_people_construction` (*r* = .67, *p* = .017) and `nationalist_exclusion` (*r* = .64, *p* = .024) are significantly correlated with `popular_sovereignty_claims`. This suggests that the "will of the people" being invoked is specifically the will of this narrowly defined, homogeneous national ingroup. The correlation between `authenticity_vs_political_class` and `nationalist_exclusion` (*r* = .69, *p* = .013) further suggests that the speaker's claim to be a genuine "outsider" is partly authenticated through this nationalist posture.

This pattern directly contradicts Hypothesis H₃, which predicted a negative relationship between nationalist and people-centric themes. Instead, the data reveals a fusion of these elements, defining a specific brand of ethno-nationalist populism.

#### 5.5 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The most salient meta-pattern in the data is one of **intensity and stability**. Across time, crisis events, and different audiences (to the limited extent this could be tested), the fundamental populist structure of the discourse remained remarkably consistent. The falsification of numerous hypotheses regarding temporal dynamics (H₂, H₇, H₉, H₁₀) and crisis impact (H₄, H₈) points not to a failure of the experiment, but to a key feature of this particular populist style: it is not adaptive or reactive, but a fixed and pervasive rhetorical worldview.

This stability, combined with the low strategic contradiction scores, suggests a "maximalist" populist strategy. Rather than modulating the message, the approach appears to be the consistent and overwhelming application of a coherent set of populist tropes. The discourse is not a "thin" ideology layered onto other ideas; it is the thick, all-encompassing frame through which all political issues are presented.

From a methodological perspective, the framework's construct validity is mixed. The low Cronbach's alpha scores (H₁₂) suggest the nine dimensions are not measuring a single, unidimensional "populism" factor. However, the emergence of a theoretically meaningful and statistically robust correlation cluster (the ethno-nationalist core) suggests the dimensions are successfully isolating distinct, valid rhetorical strategies that combine to form a populist style. This implies that populism may be better modeled as a composite of correlated, yet distinct, rhetorical components rather than a single latent trait.

#### 5.6 Framework Effectiveness Assessment

*   **Discriminatory Power Analysis:** The PDAF framework demonstrated strong discriminatory power in classifying the corpus as highly populist, with a mean overall score of 0.85. However, it showed less variability *within* the corpus, as scores were consistently high across most documents and dimensions. This suggests that while the framework is effective at identifying the presence of intense populism, its utility for fine-grained differentiation within a uniformly populist corpus may be limited. The discourse was so saturated with populism that many dimensions approached their ceiling values.

*   **Framework-Corpus Fit Evaluation:** While a specific Framework-Corpus Fit score was not generated in this analysis, the statistical patterns allow for a qualitative assessment. The fit is strong in that the corpus provided rich data for the PDAF's core dimensions. However, the corpus did not exhibit the "strategic contradictions" or temporal dynamics that the framework was partly designed to detect. This "misfit" is itself a valuable finding: it reveals that Bolsonaro's 2018 rhetoric represents a type of populism (coherent, stable) that contrasts with the more "chameleonic" models that informed the framework's design. This highlights the framework's utility not just for confirmation, but for identifying different typologies of populist discourse.

*   **Methodological Insights:** This analysis reveals important characteristics of the PDAF. The poor internal consistency (low Cronbach's alpha) across its dimensions is a critical finding. It suggests that researchers using the PDAF should be cautious about treating the overall populism index as a unidimensional measure. Instead, the framework's strength may lie in dimensional profiling and analyzing the interaction between its components, as demonstrated by the identification of the ethno-nationalist correlation cluster. The framework successfully operationalized distinct rhetorical strategies, even if they did not cohere into a single statistical factor.

### 6. Discussion

The findings of this exploratory study have significant theoretical implications. The data portrays Jair Bolsonaro's 2018 campaign rhetoric not as a strategically adaptive or contradictory performance, but as a highly stable and coherent ideological project. The falsification of numerous hypotheses concerning temporal intensification and strategic tension suggests that some theoretical models of populist communication—which emphasize flexibility and ambiguity—may not apply to all populist actors. Bolsonaro's discourse, as captured by the PDAF, appears to be a "maximalist" form of populism, where the message is fixed, intense, and consistently deployed regardless of context.

The most powerful insight is the data-driven identification of an ethno-nationalist core, where the construction of a "homogeneous people" is statistically inseparable from "nationalist exclusion." This finding provides empirical weight to qualitative assessments of Bolsonaro's populism and demonstrates the PDAF's capacity to move beyond simple populism-scoring to reveal the substantive ideological engine of a specific populist discourse. The fusion of populist mechanics with a nationalist-exclusive worldview appears to be the central formula of his appeal.

The study's limitations, most notably the small sample size (N=12), are significant. The lack of support for hypotheses related to audience adaptation (H₆) and crisis impact (H₄, H₈) may be due to a lack of statistical power. These findings should not be taken as definitive proof of no effect, but rather as an indication that any such effects were not large enough to be detected in this small sample. Future research should apply the PDAF to a much larger and more varied corpus of speeches to test these hypotheses with greater statistical power. A comparative analysis, applying the same framework to other Latin American populists (e.g., Chávez, Morales, Bukele), would be invaluable for contextualizing Bolsonaro's unique dimensional profile and testing the cross-cultural validity of the PDAF's structure.

### 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of Jair Bolsonaro's 2018 campaign speeches provides a data-driven portrait of a populist style characterized by extreme intensity, structural stability, and rhetorical coherence. The Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) identified a discourse saturated with populist content, registering a mean overall populism index of 0.85. The study's central contribution is the empirical identification of a coherent ethno-nationalist core, where the construction of a unified "people" is powerfully and significantly correlated with nationalist exclusion.

The analysis systematically tested 14 hypotheses, falsifying the majority of those predicting temporal intensification, strategic contradiction, and specific dimensional interactions. These "negative" findings are theoretically productive, challenging a one-size-fits-all model of populist communication and suggesting that Bolsonaro's 2018 rhetoric represents a distinct, highly consistent, and ideologically rigid populist typology. While the framework's dimensional structure showed weak internal consistency, its ability to uncover meaningful correlation patterns and test complex theoretical propositions demonstrates its value as an analytical tool. Despite the exploratory nature of this study due to its limited sample size, the findings provide a robust, evidence-based foundation for future research into the nature of right-wing populism in Brazil and beyond.

### 8. Methodological Summary

The statistical analysis was conducted on a dataset of 12 documents, with scores generated for nine dimensions and eight derived metrics from the Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) v10.0.2. Given the small sample size (N=12), the analytical approach was primarily exploratory and descriptive, with inferential claims made cautiously. Key statistical methods included the calculation of descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations) to characterize the central tendency and variance of populist expression. Pearson's correlation coefficient (*r*) was used to assess the interrelationships between the nine PDAF dimensions, forming the basis for identifying the core rhetorical structure. Hypothesis testing was conducted using one-sample t-tests, independent samples t-tests, and linear regression; however, due to the low statistical power, the results of these tests were interpreted as suggestive patterns rather than conclusive findings. Internal consistency of the framework's dimensional groupings was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. All analyses were performed with an explicit acknowledgment of the limitations imposed by the small sample, prioritizing the identification of large effect sizes and strong descriptive patterns for future investigation.
