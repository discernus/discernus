### marked\_up\_document
*   **Count:** 12 artifacts
*   **Description:** These are versions of the original `corpus_document` files, but with annotations or "markup" indicating the extracted evidence and/or assigned scores. This format (e.g., HTML, XML, or a custom text format) is designed for human readability and verification of the extraction process.
*   **Typical Location:** `analysis/marked_up/doc_001_marked_up.html`, ..., `analysis/marked_up/doc_012_marked_up.html`

### statistical\_analysis
*   **Count:** 1 artifact
*   **Description:** This artifact contains the aggregated statistical results derived from the analysis of all documents. It may include summary statistics, distributions, correlations, or other quantitative findings across the entire corpus. This is typically a report (PDF, HTML) or a structured data file (CSV, JSON).
*   **Typical Location:** `reports/statistical_analysis_report.pdf` (or `.json`, `.csv`)

### final\_synthesis\_report
*   **Count:** 1 artifact
*   **Description:** The ultimate output of the experiment, providing a narrative summary, interpretation of findings, conclusions, and potentially recommendations based on the `statistical_analysis` and the qualitative insights from the `composite_analysis` artifacts.
*   **Typical Location:** `reports/final_synthesis_report.md` (or `.pdf`, `.html`)

### run\_context
*   **Count:** 1 artifact
*   **Description:** This critical artifact captures the complete execution context of the experiment run. It includes details about the Discernus software version, operating system, environment variables, dependencies, and any other relevant parameters that ensure the reproducibility of the experiment.
*   **Typical Location:** `run_context.json`
