## 1. Experiment Overview

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the `bolsonaro_2018` Discernus research experiment. It provides an overview of the experiment's context, details its generated artifacts, explains the directory structure, and offers guidance for researchers and auditors wishing to understand or verify the findings.

### Purpose

The `bolsonaro_2018` experiment was conducted using the Discernus framework to perform a structured, evidence-based analysis of a specific corpus related to the 2018 Brazilian presidential election involving Jair Bolsonaro.

    *   **Location:** `experiment_spec/experiment_spec.json`

*   **`framework`** (1 artifact)
    *   **Description:** This file contains the Discernus framework definition that was used to conduct this experiment. It details the underlying analytical model, scoring rubrics, and extraction methodologies applied across all documents. It is crucial for understanding the *how* of the analysis.
    *   **Expected Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
    *   **Location:** `framework/framework.md`

### Corpus and Source Materials

*   **`corpus_manifest`** (1 artifact)
    *   **Description:** A comprehensive manifest listing all documents included in the `bolsonaro_2018` corpus. It typically includes metadata for each document, such as unique identifiers, original source URLs (if applicable), and file paths within the `corpus_document` directory.
    *   **Expected Format:** JSON
    *   **Location:** `corpus_manifest/corpus_manifest.json`

*   **`corpus_document`** (12 artifacts)
    *   **Description:** These are the original, raw source documents that formed the basis of the analysis. Each document is an unadulterated copy of the material analyzed, ensuring that the analysis can be traced back to its primary sources.
    *   **Expected Format:** Varies (e.g., PDF, HTML, TXT), but often converted to a standardized format for analysis. For this experiment, assuming PDF.
    *   **Location:** `corpus_document/document_XXX.pdf` (e.g., `document_001.pdf` to `document_012.pdf`)

### Analysis Outputs - Per Document

*   **`composite_analysis`** (12 artifacts)
    *   **Description:** For each document in the corpus, this artifact provides a consolidated view of all analytical findings. It aggregates the extracted evidence, assigned scores, and any other document-specific insights derived from the Discernus framework.
    *   **Expected Format:** JSON
    *   **Location:** `composite_analysis/document_XXX_composite_analysis.json`

*   **`evidence_extraction`** (12 artifacts)
    *   **Description:** These artifacts contain the specific textual segments, data points, or other elements extracted from each `corpus_document` that serve as direct evidence for the analysis. Each extraction is linked to the specific analytical criteria it supports.
    *   **Expected Format:** JSON
    *   **Location:** `evidence_extraction/document_XXX_evidence_extraction.json`

*   **`score_extraction`** (12 artifacts)
