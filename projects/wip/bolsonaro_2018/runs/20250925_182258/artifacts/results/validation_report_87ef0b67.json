More critically, the `electoral_proximity` grouping (distant, approaching, imminent, inter_round, final_push) is entirely missing as a metadata field from all documents in the corpus manifest, but it is referenced as a grouping variable for statistical analysis.",

Single-observation groups (n=1) must be designated as baselines and excluded from inferential testing.' Several planned statistical groups based on the corpus metadata and experiment's grouping logic have only one document. Specifically, the `campaign_stage` groups 'campaign_interruption' (n=1), 'final_campaign' (n=1), 'election_day' (n=1), and 'final_hours' (n=1) are too small for inferential statistical tests like ANOVA. Similarly, for `audience` type, 'business_leaders' has n=1.",

While linear regression is a standard capability, the corpus size (N=13) is quite small for robust trend analysis.
