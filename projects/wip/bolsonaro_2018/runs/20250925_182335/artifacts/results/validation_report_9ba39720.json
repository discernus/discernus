    "The `campaign_stage` grouping in the experiment specification has several distinct groups with very small sample sizes (n=1 or n=2). While functional, consider combining some of these groups for more robust statistical analysis if sample size permits.",
    "The experiment mentions 'dimensional patterns, strategic tensions, and the interplay between populist, patriotic, and nationalist discourses' and 'strategic tensions between different populist dimensions'. Ensure that the statistical analysis plan in the experiment.md (Section 5) explicitly addresses these by including relevant derived metrics like 'populist_strategic_contradiction_index' and pairwise correlations/ANOVAs between related dimensions.",
    "The 'Data Grouping and Custom Variable Mapping' section in experiment.md details several grouping variables (`campaign_stage`, `political_phase`, `audience`, `electoral_proximity`). Ensure that the planned statistical analyses (Section 5.1) leverage these variables appropriately to address the research questions.",
    "Consider explicitly stating the statistical tests to be used for each research question in Section 5.1 of the experiment.md, referencing the specific grouping variables and corpus metadata fields.",
    "The experiment references 'cross-cultural applicability' and 'Latin American electoral contexts'. While the framework is v10.0.2, it's worth noting in the framework's Section 4 (Intended Application & Corpus Fit) any specific considerations or limitations when applying the PDAF to Brazilian Portuguese discourse."
