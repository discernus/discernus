> Very ironically, it's at such an extreme point for Republicans that they unironically are no longer able to even recognize what the radical left even is. Ask a MAGA voter what's the difference between Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Zohran Mamdani and they wouldn't even be able to tell you because they *all* "radical Antifa left." Maybe Mamdani is more overtly "extreme" about it. And Europe, Mamdani would be a pretty bogstandard Labour-tier candidate, far from the actual *genuine* Red parties that still participate in elections, and the actual true "radical" left are the ones that think elections are bourgeois games and would rather agitate and mail bombs.

> Funniest thing is that's basically how we got here but in the other direction as well. Calling every Republican a Neo-Nazi operating a Fascist regime, and now we have Trump and his white nationalist buddy Stephen Miller in control, and people didn't see how he was going to functionally be any different from Reagan or Bush since everyone called *them* fascists too, so there's nothing to worry about because we survived them, but now wait, why is he organizing ICE like a secret police force or threatening to crack down on political enemies? Weren't the COINTELPRO days behind us? Whoops, looks like [para-fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Para-fascism) came to America wrapped in an Israeli flag and carrying a cross, and you didn't realize it until too late.

> > This is an extremely misleading characterization of the Clinton administration. Clinton governed more progressively for his first two years in office, and in response the voters punished him for it by sweeping Democrats out of power in the Senate and handing Newt Gingrich and far right Republicans 54 formerly Democratic House seats, the biggest congressional swing in half a century. It was this rejection by the voters that caused Clinton to triangulate, and it wasn’t until 1996, after he’d already been moderating for four years, that he signed a budget with a surplus. Clinton had worse approval ratings in 1993 when he was trying to pass universal healthcare and had passed gun control legislation, than he did at any point when he was acting as a centrist.
> > 
> > It is simply disingenuous to pretend that the voters, particularly working class voters, didn’t reject the progressive years of his administration. They gave Republicans control of both chambers of Congress for the rest of his administration in response to them. Clinton moved to the center because elections have consequences.

When hit on transgender inclusion in sports, he doesn’t sermonize; he notes Ohio already banned what the ad alleges and says local leagues should decide — citing Republican Gov. Mike DeWine.
> 
> - In Texas, Colin Allred stands with law enforcement and border officials who say, “Colin’s got our back” and insist that Allred will be tougher than Ted Cruz on crime and the border.
> - In Montana, Jon Tester boasts that he pushed Joe Biden to expand oil drilling and says “no way to Democrats wanting to give people more money without requiring anything in return.”
> - In New Mexico’s 2nd, Gabe Vasquez talks about hiring twenty thousand border agents and cracking down on cartels, with law enforcement as witnesses.
> - In Pennsylvania’s 7th, Susan Wild said it outright: she “broke with Democrats” to crack down on cartels and worked with both parties to hire thousands of border agents.
> - In New York’s 17th, a police officer endorses Mondaire Jones in an ad saying he “voted for more border patrol agents.”
> - In Arizona’s 6th, Kirsten Engel’s ad has a law enforcement official saying she will “fully fund police” and work with both parties on border security.
> 
> > The 2024 record is straightforward: frontline Democrats campaigned largely as moderates. Border and police funding, fentanyl crackdowns, oil drilling permits, law-enforcement endorsements, bipartisan validators. The ads show badges and sheriffs. And yet the coalitions barely moved. It feels like talking into a headwind.

And his transgender campaign response wasn't great but it was just a factual statement about the current legality of trans women in sports in Ohio and not a policy position.

When hit on transgender inclusion in sports, he doesn’t sermonize; he notes Ohio already banned what the ad alleges and says local leagues should decide — citing Republican Gov. Mike DeWine.
> 
> - In Texas, Colin Allred stands with law enforcement and border officials who say, “Colin’s got our back” and insist that Allred will be tougher than Ted Cruz on crime and the border.
> - In Montana, Jon Tester boasts that he pushed Joe Biden to expand oil drilling and says “no way to Democrats wanting to give people more money without requiring anything in return.”
> - In New Mexico’s 2nd, Gabe Vasquez talks about hiring twenty thousand border agents and cracking down on cartels, with law enforcement as witnesses.
> - In Pennsylvania’s 7th, Susan Wild said it outright: she “broke with Democrats” to crack down on cartels and worked with both parties to hire thousands of border agents.
> - In New York’s 17th, a police officer endorses Mondaire Jones in an ad saying he “voted for more border patrol agents.”
> - In Arizona’s 6th, Kirsten Engel’s ad has a law enforcement official saying she will “fully fund police” and work with both parties on border security.
> 
> > The 2024 record is straightforward: frontline Democrats campaigned largely as moderates. Border and police funding, fentanyl crackdowns, oil drilling permits, law-enforcement endorsements, bipartisan validators. The ads show badges and sheriffs. And yet the coalitions barely moved. It feels like talking into a headwind.

The problem is that with every step Democrats took to the right, the more it drove Republicans further right until we have what we have today. The GOP put sheep's clothing on the wolf and pretended to be populous. It was a lie, a con.

> The Democrats' platform is dictated by the members of the party. If the Democratic platform isn't progressive enough, it's because the members of the party want them to focus on so-called centrist issues. The reason Democrats don't push these "progressive" platforms is because there isn't enough support within the party to do so. That's called politics.

> The idea that we should swing into wildly leftist ideas on the off-chance that it'll get the people who continually sit out elections to join the team is just stupid.

Conservatives for a very long time have slowly, surely chipped away at the booming middle class that came out of the post-war era. They shut down unions. Slashed taxes to the bone. They keep concentrating wealth higher and higher. The public hasn't even noticed it.
> 
> A far left candidate won't work because there's not a single left candidate that will work. A moderate candidate won't work either. The bottom line is.... they've won. They have modified and outfitted our government so much that it's nearly impossible for a person the left to win.
> 
> The only way a Democrat can take the White House now is if it's somebody that people fall in love with, as it seems to be the only way Democrats get the White House. Right now, that person doesn't exist. Any person who comes up on the left is either too moderate for hard left or too hard left for the moderate.

> Half the country now has no political "home". It's weird. Doesn't translate to electoral victories at all because, again, they're without a party that represents them. Results in more radicalization and anger. That's just where we are now.
