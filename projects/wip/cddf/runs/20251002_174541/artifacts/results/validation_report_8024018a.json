    "General suggestion 1: The experiment specification clearly outlines a robust methodology for testing CDDF v10.2's genre-aware modes. The corpus design is also well-aligned with the experimental goals.",
    "General suggestion 2: Consider adding more explicit guidance within the framework's machine-readable appendix on how to handle the \"Hybrid/Mixed Analysis\" mode, especially regarding the aggregation or segmentation of scores when a document contains both formal and spontaneous elements.",
    "General suggestion 3: The experiment's statistical success criteria for H_beta (Contamination Detection) relies on a Mann-Whitney U test with p < .05. Given the Bonferroni correction (alpha = 0.01), this is a more stringent requirement. Ensure the power analysis and expected effect sizes are sufficient to meet this adjusted alpha level."
