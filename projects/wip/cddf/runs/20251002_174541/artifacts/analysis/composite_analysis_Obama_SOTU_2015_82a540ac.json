They've done\\nso during periods of prosperity and tranquility, and they've done so in the\\nmidst of war and depression, at moments of great strife and great struggle.\\nIt's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress\\nwas inevitable, that America was always destined to succeed. But when the\\nUnion was turned back at Bull Run and the Allies first landed at Omaha\\nBeach, victory was very much in doubt. When the market crashed on Black\\nTuesday and marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday, the future was\\nanything but certain. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: These were the times that tested the courage of our\\nconvictions and the strength of our Union.] And despite all our divisions and\\ndisagreements, our hesitations and our fears, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: America prevailed because\\nwe chose to move forward as one Nation, as one people.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: Again, we are\\ntested. And again, we must answer history's call.]\\n\\nOne year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe\\nrecession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a Government\\ndeeply in debt. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we\\ndid not act, we might face a second depression.] So we acted, immediately\\nand aggressively. And 1 year later, the worst of the storm has passed.\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: But the devastation remains. One in 10 Americans still cannot find work.\\nMany businesses have shuttered. Home values have declined. Small towns\\nand rural communities have been hit especially hard. And for those who'd\\nalready known poverty, life's become that much harder.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: This recession has also compounded the burdens that America's families\\nhave been dealing with for decades: the burden of working harder and\\nlonger for less, of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with\\ncollege.]\\nSo I know the anxieties that are out there right now. They're not new. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: These\\nstruggles are the reason I ran for President. These struggles are what I've\\nwitnessed for years, in places like Elkhart, Indiana; Galesburg, Illinois. I hear\\nabout them in the letters that I read each night. The toughest to read are\\nthose written by children asking why they have to move from their home,\\nasking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work.]\\nFor these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast\\nenough. [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Some are frustrated, some are angry. They don't understand why it\\nseems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded, but hard work on Main\\nStreet isn't, or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of\\nour problems.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: They're tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the\\npettiness. They know we can't afford it. Not now.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: So we face big and difficult challenges. And what the American people hope,\\nwhat they deserve, is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work\\nthrough our differences, to overcome the numbing weight of our politics.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: For while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds,\\ndifferent stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same. The\\naspirations they hold are shared: a job that pays the bills, a chance to get\\nahead, most of all, the ability to give their children a better life.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: And you know what else they share? They share a stubborn resilience in the\\nface of adversity. After one of the most difficult years in our history, they\\nremain busy building cars and teaching kids, starting businesses and going\\nback to school. They're coaching Little League and helping their neighbors.]\\nOne woman wrote to me and said, [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: \\\"We are strained but hopeful, struggling\\nbut encouraged.\\\"]\\n[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: It's because of this spirit, this great decency and great strength, that I have\\nnever been more hopeful about America's future than I am tonight. Despite\\nour hardships, our Union is strong. We do not give up. We do not quit. We\\ndo not allow fear or division to break our spirit.] In this new decade, it's time\\nthe American people get a Government that matches their decency, that\\nembodies their strength. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And tonight I'd like to talk about how together we\\ncan deliver on that promise.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: It begins with our economy.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our most urgent task upon taking office was to\\nshore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis.] It was not easy to do.\\nAnd if there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and\\neverybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank bailout. I hated it. I\\nhated it; you hated it. It was about as popular as a root canal. [Laughter]\\nBut when I ran for President, I promised I wouldn't just do what was\\npopular; [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: I would do what was necessary. And if we had allowed the\\nmeltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it\\nis today. More businesses would certainly have closed. More homes would\\nhave surely been lost.]\\nSo I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue\\nprogram. And when we took that program over, we made it more\\ntransparent and more accountable. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: And as a result, the markets are now\\nstabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banks--\\nmost but not all.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: To recover the rest, I've proposed a fee on the biggest banks.] Now, [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: I know\\nWall Street isn't keen on this idea. But if these firms can afford to hand out\\nbig bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers\\nwho rescued them in their time of need.]\\nNow, as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our\\neconomy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help Americans\\nwho had become unemployed. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: That's why we extended or increased\\nunemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans, made health\\ninsurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through\\nCOBRA, and passed 25 different tax cuts.]\\nNow, let me repeat: [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working\\nfamilies. We cut taxes for small businesses. We cut taxes for first-time home\\nbuyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut\\ntaxes for 8 million Americans paying for college.] [Applause ] I thought I'd get\\nsome applause on that one. [Laughter]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: As a result, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and\\nother necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers. And\\nwe haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person--not a\\nsingle dime.]\\nNow, because of the steps we took, [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: there are about 2 million Americans\\nworking right now who would otherwise be unemployed. Two hundred\\nthousand work in construction and clean energy. Three hundred thousand\\nare teachers and other education workers. Tens of thousands are cops,\\nfirefighters, correctional officers, first-responders. And we're on track to\\nadd another 1 1/2 million jobs to this total by the end of the year.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is\\nthe Recovery Act. That's right, the Recovery Act, also known as the stimulus\\nbill.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs\\nand avert disaster. But you don't have to take their word for it. Talk to the\\nsmall business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the\\nRecovery Act. Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he\\nused to be skeptical about the Recovery Act, until he had to add two more\\nwork shifts just because of the business it created. Talk to the single teacher\\nraising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that\\nbecause of the Recovery Act, she wouldn't be laid off after all.]\\n[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: There are stories like this all across America.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: And after 2 years of recession,\\nthe economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started to gain back\\nsome of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly\\nsome are starting to hire again.]\\nBut I realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men and\\nwomen who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next\\npaycheck will come from, who send out resumes week after week and hear\\nnothing in response. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: That is why jobs must be our number-one focus in\\n2010, and that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight.]\\nNow, [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's\\nbusinesses. [Applause ] I agree, absolutely.] But Government can create the\\nconditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We\\nshould start where most new jobs do, in small businesses, companies that\\nbegin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker\\ndecides it's time she became her own boss.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Through sheer grit and\\ndetermination, these companies have weathered the recession, and they're\\nready to grow. But when you talk to small-business owners in places like\\nAllentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though\\nbanks on Wall Street are lending again, they're mostly lending to bigger\\ncompanies. Financing remains difficult for small-business owners across the\\ncountry, even those that are making a profit.]\\nSo tonight I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street\\nbanks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small\\nbusinesses the credit they need to stay afloat. I'm also proposing a new\\nsmall business tax credit, one that will go to over 1 million small businesses\\nwho hire new workers or raise wages. While we're at it, let's also eliminate\\nall capital gains taxes on small-business investment and provide a tax\\nincentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new\\nplants and equipment.\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Next, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of\\ntomorrow. From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System, our\\nNation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or\\nChina should have the fastest trains or the new factories that manufacture\\nclean energy products.] Tomorrow I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers\\nwill soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the\\nRecovery Act. There are projects like that all across this country that will\\ncreate jobs and help move our Nation's goods, services, and information.\\nWe should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities and\\ngive rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy efficient,\\nwhich supports clean energy jobs. And to encourage these and other\\nbusinesses to stay within our borders, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: it is time to finally slash the tax\\nbreaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks\\nto companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America.]\\nNow, the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: As\\nthe first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same, and I\\nknow they will. They will. People are out of work. They're hurting. They need\\nour help. And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: But the truth is, these steps won't make up for the 7 million jobs that we've\\nlost over the last 2 years. The only way to move to full employment is to lay\\na new foundation for long-term economic growth and finally address the\\nproblems that America's families have confronted for years.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We can't afford another so-called economic expansion like the one from the\\nlast decade, what some call the \\\"lost decade,\\\" where jobs grew more slowly\\nthan during any prior expansion, where the income of the average\\nAmerican household declined while the cost of health care and tuition\\nreached record highs, where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and\\nfinancial speculation.]\\nFrom the day I took office, I've been told that addressing our larger\\nchallenges is too ambitious; such an effort would be too contentious. I've\\nbeen told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just\\nput things on hold for a while. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: For those who make these claims, I have one\\nsimple question: How long should we wait? How long should America put its\\nfuture on hold?]\\nYou see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the\\nproblems have grown worse. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Meanwhile, China's not waiting to revamp its\\neconomy. Germany's not waiting. India's not waiting. These nations are--\\nthey're not standing still. These nations aren't playing for second place. ]They're putting more emphasis on math and science. They're rebuilding\\ntheir infrastructure. They're making serious investments in clean energy\\nbecause they want those jobs. Well, [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I do not accept second place for the\\nUnited States of America.] As hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and\\ncontentious as the debates may become, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: it's time to get serious about\\nfixing the problems that are hampering our growth.]\\nNow, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: one place to start is serious financial reform.] Look, [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I am not interested\\nin punishing banks. I'm interested in protecting our economy.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: A strong,\\nhealthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit\\nand create new jobs. It channels the savings of families into investments\\nthat raise incomes. But that can only happen if we guard against the same\\nrecklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We need to make sure consumers and middle class families have the\\ninformation they need to make financial decisions. We can't allow financial\\ninstitutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that\\nthreaten the whole economy.]\\nNow, the House has already passed financial reform with many of these\\nchanges, and [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: the lobbyists are trying to kill it.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: But we cannot let them win\\nthis fight.] And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of\\nreal reform, I will send it back until we get it right. [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: We've got to get it right.]\\nNext, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we need to encourage American innovation.] Last year, we made the\\nlargest investment in basic research funding in history, [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: an investment that\\ncould lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer\\ncells, but leaves healthy ones untouched.] And no area is more ripe for such\\ninnovation than energy. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: You can see the results of last year's investments in\\nclean energy in the North Carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs\\nnationwide helping to make advanced batteries or in the California business\\nthat will put a thousand people to work making solar panels.]\\nBut to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production,\\nmore efficiency, more incentives. And that means building a new generation\\nof safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country. It means making tough\\ndecisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development. It\\nmeans continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal\\ntechnologies. And yes, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: it means passing a comprehensive energy and\\nclimate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable\\nkind of energy in America.] Now, I am grateful to the House for passing such\\na bill last year. And this year, I'm eager to help advance the bipartisan effort\\nin the Senate.\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I know there have been questions about whether we can afford such\\nchanges in a tough economy. I know that there are those who disagree with\\nthe overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change.] But here's the\\nthing: Even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy\\nefficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future, because\\nthe nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads\\nthe global economy. [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: And America must be that nation.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Third, we need to export more of our goods, because the more products we\\nmake and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in\\nAmerica.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: So tonight we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the\\nnext 5 years, an increase that will support 2 million jobs in America.] To help\\nmeet this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help\\nfarmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export\\ncontrols consistent with national security.\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are.\\nIf America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will\\nlose the chance to create jobs on our shores.] But realizing those benefits\\nalso means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the\\nrules. And that's why we'll continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that\\nopens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia\\nand with key partners like South Korea and Panama and Colombia.\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people.] Now,\\nthis year, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by\\nlaunching a national competition to improve our schools.] And the idea here\\nis simple: [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. Instead of\\nfunding the status quo, we only invest in reform, reform that raises student\\nachievement, inspires students to excel in math and science, and turns\\naround failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans,\\nfrom rural communities to the inner city.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: In the 21st century, the best\\nantipoverty program around is a world-class education.] And in this country,\\nthe success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on\\ntheir potential. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education\\nAct, we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 States.]\\nStill, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good\\njob.] That's why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will\\nrevitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the\\nchildren of so many working families.\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: To make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted\\ntaxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans.] Instead, let's take\\nthat money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for 4 years of college and\\nincrease Pell grants. And let's tell another 1 million students that when they\\ngraduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on\\nstudent loans and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years and\\nforgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: because in\\nthe United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose\\nto go to college.] And by the way, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: it's time for colleges and universities to get\\nserious about cutting their own costs, because they too have a\\nresponsibility to help solve this problem.]\\nNow, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle\\nclass.] That's why last year, I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force\\non middle class families. That's why we're nearly doubling the childcare tax\\ncredit and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every\\nworker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who\\nstart a nest egg. That's why we're working to lift the value of a family's single\\nlargest investment, their home. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The steps we took last year to shore up the\\nhousing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans\\nand save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments.] This year, we will\\nstep up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable\\nmortgages.\\nAnd [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle class families that we still\\nneed health insurance reform. Yes, we do.]\\nNow, [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: let's clear a few things up. I didn't choose to tackle this issue to get\\nsome legislative victory under my belt. And by now it should be fairly\\nobvious that I didn't take on health care because it was good politics. ] [Laughter] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I took on health care because of the stories I've heard from\\nAmericans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting\\ncoverage, patients who've been denied coverage, families, even those with\\ninsurance, who are just one illness away from financial ruin.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: After nearly a century of trying--Democratic administrations, Republican\\nadministrations--we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the\\nlives of so many Americans. The approach we've taken would protect every\\nAmerican from the worst practices of the insurance industry. It would give\\nsmall businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an\\naffordable health care plan in a competitive market. It would require every\\ninsurance plan to cover preventive care.]\\nAnd by the way, [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I want to acknowledge our First Lady, Michelle Obama, who\\nthis year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of\\nchildhood obesity and make kids healthier.] [Applause ] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Thank you, honey.\\nShe gets embarrassed.] [Laughter]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to\\nkeep their doctor and their plan. It would reduce costs and premiums for\\nmillions of families and businesses. And according to the Congressional\\nBudget Office, the independent organization that both parties have cited as\\nthe official scorekeeper for Congress, our approach would bring down the\\ndeficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades.]\\nStill, [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more\\nskeptical people became. I take my share of the blame for not explaining it\\nmore clearly to the American people.] And I know that with all the lobbying\\nand horse-trading, [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: the process left most Americans wondering, \\\"What's in it\\nfor me?\\\"]\\nBut I also know this problem is not going away. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: By the time I'm finished\\nspeaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance.\\nMillions will lose it this year. Our deficit will grow. Premiums will go up.\\nPatients will be denied the care they need. Small-business owners will\\ncontinue to drop coverage altogether.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I will not walk away from these\\nAmericans, and neither should the people in this Chamber.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: So as temperatures cool, I want everyone to take another look at the plan\\nwe've proposed.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: There's a reason why many doctors, nurses, and health\\ncare experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast\\nimprovement over the status quo.] But if anyone from either party has a\\nbetter approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit,\\ncover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance\\ncompany abuses, [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: let me know. Let me know. Let me know. I'm eager to see\\nit.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Here's what I ask Congress, though: Don't walk away from reform. Not now.\\nNot when we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the\\njob for the American people. Let's get it done. Let's get it done.]\\nNow, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough\\nto dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves.] It's a\\nchallenge that makes all others that much harder to solve and one that's\\nbeen subject to a lot of political posturing. So let me start the discussion of\\nGovernment spending by setting the record straight.\\n[TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: At the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, America had a budget\\nsurplus of over $200 billion. By the time I took office, we had a 1-year deficit\\nof over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade.\\nMost of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an\\nexpensive prescription drug program. On top of that, the effects of the\\nrecession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget. All this was before I walked in\\nthe door. [Laughter] Now--[applause ]--just stating the facts.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Now, if we had taken office in\\nordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down\\nthe deficit. But we took office amid a crisis.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: And our efforts to prevent a\\nsecond depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt. That\\ntoo is a fact.]\\n[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do.] But families across\\nthe country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The\\nFederal Government should do the same. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: So tonight I'm proposing specific\\nsteps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last\\nyear.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze Government spending for 3\\nyears. Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and\\nSocial Security will not be affected. But all other discretionary Government\\nprograms will. Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget\\nto invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't. And if I have to\\nenforce this discipline by veto, I will.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will continue to go through the budget, line by line, page by page, to\\neliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work. We've already\\nidentified $20 billion in savings for next year.] To help working families, we'll\\nextend our middle class tax cuts. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: But at a time of record deficits, we will not\\ncontinue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and for\\nthose making over $250,000 a year. We just can't afford it.]\\nNow, [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the\\nmassive deficit we had when I took office.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: More importantly, the cost of\\nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will continue to skyrocket.] That's\\nwhy [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: I've called for a bipartisan fiscal commission, modeled on a proposal by\\nRepublican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad. This can't be one of\\nthose Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solve a problem.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: The\\ncommission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain\\ndeadline.]\\nNow, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: yesterday the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this\\ncommission, so I'll issue an Executive order that will allow us to go forward,\\nbecause I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of\\nAmericans.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And when the vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should restore\\nthe pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why we had record\\nsurpluses in the 1990s.]\\nNow, [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I know that some in my own party will argue that we can't address the\\ndeficit or freeze Government spending when so many are still hurting. And I\\nagree, which is why this freeze won't take effect until next year, when the\\neconomy is stronger. That's how budgeting works.] [Laughter] But\\nunderstand, [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could\\ndamage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our\\nrecovery, all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth\\nand family incomes.]\\n[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: From some on the right, I expect we'll hear a different argument, that if we\\njust make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts, including those\\nfor the wealthier Americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the\\nstatus quo on health care, our deficits will go away.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: The problem is, that's\\nwhat we did for 8 years. That's what helped us into this crisis. It's what\\nhelped lead to these deficits. We can't do it again.]\\n[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington\\nfor decades, it's time to try something new.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Let's invest in our people\\nwithout leaving them a mountain of debt. Let's meet our responsibility to\\nthe citizens who sent us here. Let's try common sense--[Laughter]--a novel\\nconcept.]\\nNow, to do that, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of\\ndollars right now. We face a deficit of trust, deep and corrosive doubts\\nabout how Washington works that have been growing for years.] To close\\nthat credibility gap, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania\\nAvenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists, to do our work openly, to\\ngive our people the Government they deserve.]\\nNow, that's what I came to Washington to do. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: That's why, for the first time\\nin history, my administration posts on--our White House visitors online.\\nThat's why we've excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs or seats on\\nFederal boards and commissions.] But we can't stop there. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: It's time to\\nrequire lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client,\\nwith my administration or with Congress. It's time to put strict limits on the\\ncontributions that lobbyists give to candidates for Federal office.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: With all due deference to separation of powers, last week, the Supreme\\nCourt reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for\\nspecial interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in\\nour elections.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by\\nAmerica's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They\\nshould be decided by the American people.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And I'd urge Democrats and\\nRepublicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: I'm also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform,\\nDemocrats and Republicans--Democrats and Republicans.] Look, you've\\ntrimmed some of this spending, you've embraced some meaningful change,\\nbut [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: restoring the public trust demands more. For example, some Members\\nof Congress post some earmark requests online.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Tonight I'm calling on\\nCongress to publish all earmark requests on a single web site before there's\\na vote so that the American people can see how their money is being spent.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also reform\\nhow we work with one another.] Now, [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I'm not naive. I never thought that the\\nmere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony and--\\n[Laughter]--some postpartisan era.] I knew that both parties have fed\\ndivisions that are deeply entrenched. And on some issues, [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: there are simply\\nphilosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. They're the very essence of our democracy.]\\nBut [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day\\nis election day. We can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is\\nto see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side, a\\nbelief that if you lose, I win.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Neither party should delay or obstruct every\\nsingle bill just because they can. The confirmation of--I'm speaking to both\\nparties now--the confirmation of well-qualified public servants shouldn't be\\nheld hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual Senators.]\\n[TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: Washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter\\nhow false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game.] But it's\\nprecisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the\\nAmerican people. [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Worse yet, it's sowing further division among our citizens,\\nfurther distrust in our Government.] So no, [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I will not give up on trying to\\nchange the tone of our politics.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: I know it's an election year. And after last\\nweek, it's clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual. But\\nwe still need to govern.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: To Democrats, I would remind you that we still have the largest majority in\\ndecades and the people expect us to solve problems, not run for the hills.]\\nAnd if the Republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the\\nSenate are required to do any business at all in this town--a supermajority--\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: then the responsibility to govern is now yours as well.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Just saying no to\\neverything may be good short-term politics, but it's not leadership.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We were\\nsent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions. So let's show the\\nAmerican people that we can do it together.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: This week, I'll be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans. I'd like to\\nbegin monthly meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership.] I\\nknow you can't wait. [Laughter]\\nNow, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than\\nour security.] Sadly, [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated.] And\\nwe can argue all we want about who's to blame for this, [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: but I'm not\\ninterested in relitigating the past.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I know that all of us love this country. All\\nof us are committed to its defense.] So let's put aside the schoolyard taunts\\nabout who's tough. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Let's reject the false choice between protecting our\\npeople and upholding our values. Let's leave behind the fear and division\\nand do what it takes to defend our Nation and forge a more hopeful future\\nfor America and for the world.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: That's the work we began last year. Since the day I took office, we've\\nrenewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our Nation.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We've made\\nsubstantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that\\nthreatened to take American lives. We are filling unacceptable gaps\\nrevealed by the failed Christmas attack, with better airline security and\\nswifter action on our intelligence. We've prohibited torture and\\nstrengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian\\nPeninsula. And in the last year, hundreds of Al Qaida's fighters and\\naffiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed, far\\nmore than in 2008.]\\nAnd in Afghanistan, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we're increasing our troops and training Afghan\\nsecurity forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011 and our\\ntroops can begin to come home. We will reward good governance, work to\\nreduce corruption, and support the rights of all Afghans, men and women\\nalike.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We're joined by allies and partners who have increased their own\\ncommitments and who will come together tomorrow in London to reaffirm\\nour common purpose.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: There will be difficult days ahead, but I am absolutely\\nconfident we will succeed.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: As we take the fight to Al Qaida, we are responsibly leaving Iraq to its\\npeople.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: As a candidate, I promised that I would end this war, and that is\\nwhat I am doing as President. We will have all of our combat troops out of\\nIraq by the end of this August. We will support the Iraqi Government as they\\nhold elections, and we will continue to partner with the Iraqi people to\\npromote regional peace and prosperity. But make no mistake: This war is\\nending, and all of our troops are coming home.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Tonight all of our men and women in uniform, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and\\naround the world, they have to know that we--that they have our respect,\\nour gratitude, our full support.] And just as they must have the resources\\nthey need in war, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we all have a responsibility to support them when they\\ncome home. That's why we made the largest increase in investments for\\nveterans in decades last year. That's why we're building a 21st-century VA.\\nAnd that's why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to forge a national\\ncommitment to support military families.]\\nNow, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: even as we prosecute two wars, we're also confronting perhaps the\\ngreatest danger to the American people, the threat of nuclear weapons.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: I've\\nembraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a\\nstrategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world\\nwithout them.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our\\ndeterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the\\nfarthest reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades.] And at April's\\nNuclear Security Summit, [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: we will bring 44 nations together here in\\nWashington, DC, behind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable nuclear\\nmaterials around the world in 4 years so that they never fall into the hands\\nof terrorists.]\\nNow, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing\\nwith those nations that insist on violating international agreements in\\npursuit of nuclear weapons. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: That's why North Korea now faces increased\\nisolation and stronger sanctions, sanctions that are being vigorously\\nenforced.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: That's why the international community is more united and the\\nIslamic Republic of Iran is more isolated.] And as Iran's leaders continue to\\nignore their obligations, [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: there should be no doubt: They too will face\\ngrowing consequences. That is a promise.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: That's the leadership we are providing: engagement that advances the\\ncommon security and prosperity of all people.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We're working through the\\nG-20 to sustain a lasting global recovery. We're working with Muslim\\ncommunities around the world to promote science and education and\\ninnovation. We have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against\\nclimate change. We're helping developing countries to feed themselves and\\ncontinuing the fight against HIV/AIDS. And we are launching a new initiative\\nthat will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to\\nbioterrorism or an infectious disease, a plan that will counter threats at\\nhome and strengthen public health abroad.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: As we have for over 60 years, America takes these actions because our\\ndestiny is connected to those beyond our shores. But we also do it because\\nit is right.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: That's why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 Americans are\\nworking with many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild.]\\n[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: That's why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan,\\nwhy we support the human rights of the women marching through the\\nstreets of Iran, why we advocate for the young man denied a job by\\ncorruption in Guinea. For America must always stand on the side of\\nfreedom and human dignity--always.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Abroad, America's greatest source of strength has always been our ideals.\\nThe same is true at home.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing\\non the promise enshrined in our Constitution: The notion that we're all\\ncreated equal; that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you\\nabide by the law, you should be protected by it; if you adhere to our\\ncommon values, you should be treated no different than anyone else.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We must continually renew this promise. My administration has a Division\\nthat is once again prosecuting violations and employment discrimination.\\nWe finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate.]\\nThis year, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law\\nthat denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because\\nof who they are.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: It's the right thing to do.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We're going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws so that women\\nget equal pay for an equal day's work.] And [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we should continue the work of\\nfixing our broken immigration system, to secure our borders and enforce\\nour laws and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to\\nour economy and enrich our Nation.]\\nIn the end, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: it's our ideals, our values that built America, values that allowed\\nus to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe,\\nvalues that drive our citizens still. Every day, Americans meet their\\nresponsibilities to their families and their employers. Time and again, they\\nlend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country. They take\\npride in their labor and are generous in spirit.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: These aren't Republican\\nvalues or Democratic values that they're living by, business values or labor\\nvalues, they're American values.]\\nUnfortunately, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest\\ninstitutions--our corporations, our media, and, yes, our Government--still\\nreflect these same values.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: Each of these institutions are full of honorable\\nmen and women doing important work that helps our country prosper. But\\neach time a CEO rewards himself for failure or a banker puts the rest of us\\nat risk for his own selfish gain, people's doubts grow. Each time lobbyists\\ngame the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this\\ncountry up, we lose faith. The more that TV pundits reduce serious debates\\nto silly arguments, big issues into sound bites, our citizens turn away. No\\nwonder there's so much cynicism out there. No wonder there's so much\\ndisappointment.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I campaigned on the promise of change. Change we can believe in, the\\nslogan went.] And right now [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I know there are many Americans who aren't\\nsure if they still believe we can change or that I can deliver it.]\\nBut remember this: [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I never suggested that change would be easy or that I\\ncould do it alone. Democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy\\nand messy and complicated.] And when you try to do big things and make\\nbig changes, it stirs passions and controversy. That's just how it is.\\n[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and\\navoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers. We can do what's necessary\\nto keep our poll numbers high and get through the next election, instead of\\ndoing what's best for the next generation.]\\nBut [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I also know this: If people had made that decision 50 years ago or 100\\nyears ago or 200 years ago, we wouldn't be here tonight. The only reason\\nwe are here is because generations of Americans were unafraid to do what\\nwas hard, to do what was needed even when success was uncertain, to do\\nwhat it took to keep the dream of this Nation alive for their children and\\ntheir grandchildren.]\\nNow, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: our administration has had some political setbacks this year, and\\nsome of them were deserved.] But [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I wake up every day knowing that they\\nare nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country\\nhave faced this year.] And [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: what keeps me going, what keeps me fighting, is\\nthat despite all these setbacks, that spirit of determination and optimism,\\nthat fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the American\\npeople, that lives on.]\\n[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: It lives on in the struggling small-business owner who wrote to me of his\\ncompany, \\\"None of us,\\\" he said, \\\". . . are willing to consider, even slightly,\\nthat we might fail.\\\" It lives on in the woman who said that even though she\\nand her neighbors have felt the pain of recession, \\\"We are strong. We are\\nresilient. We are American.\\\"] It lives on in the 8-year-old boy in Louisiana\\nwho just sent me his allowance and asked if I would give it to the people of\\nHaiti. And [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: it lives on in all the Americans who've dropped everything to go\\nsomeplace they've never been and pull people they've never known from\\nthe rubble, prompting chants of \\\"U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\\\" when another life\\nwas saved.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: The spirit that has sustained this Nation for more than two centuries lives\\non in you, its people. We have finished a difficult year. We have come\\nthrough a difficult decade. But a new year has come. A new decade\\nstretches before us. We don't quit. I don't quit. Let's seize this moment to\\nstart anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our Union once\\nmore.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.]\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"statistical_validity_warnings\": [\n    \"Warning: Sample size too small for reliable statistical analysis (N=1)\"\n  ]\n}\n```",
