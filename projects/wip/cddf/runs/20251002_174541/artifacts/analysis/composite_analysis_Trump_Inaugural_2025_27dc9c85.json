They're raging through the houses and communities, even\\naffecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our\\ncountry, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don't have a home\\nany longer. [PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: That's interesting.] But we can't let this happen. Everyone is\\nunable to do anything about it. That's going to change.\\nWe have a [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster],\\nyet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.\\n\\nAnd we have an [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: education system that teaches our children to be ashamed\\nof themselves], in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we\\ntry so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today,\\nand it will change very quickly.\\nMy recent election is a [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible\\nbetrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place] and to give\\nthe people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed, their\\nfreedom. From this moment on, America's decline is over.\\nOur liberties and our Nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied. And\\nwe will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of\\nAmerica's Government.\\nOver the past 8 years, I have been tested and challenged more than any\\nPresident in our 250-year history, and I've learned a lot along the way. The\\njourney to reclaim our Republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell\\nyou. [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and,\\nindeed, to take my life.]\\nJust a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet\\nripped through my ear.

We will\\nmove with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and\\npeace for [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed].\\nFor American citizens, January 20, 2025, is liberation day. It is my hope that\\nour recent Presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and\\nmost consequential election in the history of our country.\\nAs our victory showed, the [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our\\nagenda] with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of\\nour society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic\\nAmericans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural.

In everything we do, my administration will be\\ninspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will\\nnot forget our country, we will not forget our Constitution, and we will not\\nforget our God. [Applause] Can't do that.\\nToday I will sign a series of historic Executive orders. With these actions, we\\nwill begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of\\ncommon sense. It's all about common sense.\\nFirst, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal\\nentry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning\\nmillions and millions of [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: criminal aliens] back to the places from which they\\ncame. We will reinstate my \\\"Remain in Mexico\\\" policy.\\nI will end the practice of catch-and-release. And I will send troops to the\\nsouthern border to repel the [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: disastrous invasion of our country]. Under the\\norders I sign today, we will also be designating the [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: cartels as foreign\\nterrorist organizations].\\nAnd by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our Government\\nto use the full and immense power of Federal and State law enforcement to\\neliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing\\ndevastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.\\nAs Commander in Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our\\ncountry from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to\\ndo. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\\n\\nNext, I will direct all members of my Cabinet to marshal the vast powers at\\ntheir disposal to defeat [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: what was record inflation] and rapidly bring down\\ncosts and prices. The [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending\\nand escalating energy prices], and that is why today I will also declare a\\nnational energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\\nAmerica will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something\\nthat no other manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil\\nand gas of any country on earth, and we are going to use it. We'll use it.\\nWe will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the\\ntop, and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation\\nagain, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.\\nWith my actions today, we will end the \\\"green new deal,\\\" and we will revoke\\nthe electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my\\nsacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. In other words, you'll be\\nable to buy the car of your choice.\\nWe will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have\\ndreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the autoworkers of\\nour Nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with\\ntheir vote.\\nI will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect\\nAmerican workers and families. [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich\\nother countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our\\ncitizens.]\\nFor this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect\\nall tariffs, duties, and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money\\npouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources. The American\\ndream will soon be back and thriving like never before.\\nTo restore competence and effectiveness to our Federal Government, my\\nadministration will establish the brandnew Department of Government\\nEfficiency.\\n\\nAfter years and years of [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: illegal and unconstitutional Federal efforts to\\nrestrict free expression], I also will sign an Executive order to immediately\\nstop all Government censorship and bring back free speech to America.\\nNever again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to\\npersecute political opponents, [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: something I know something about].\\n[Laughter] We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again. Under\\nmy leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the\\nconstitutional rule of law. And we are going to bring law and order back to\\nour cities.\\nThis week, I will also end the [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Government policy of trying to socially\\nengineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life]. We\\nwill forge a society that is colorblind and merit based. As of today, it will\\nhenceforth be the official policy of the United States Government that there\\nare only two genders: male and female.\\nThis week, I will reinstate any servicemembers who were unjustly expelled\\nfrom our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full\\nbackpay.\\nAnd I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: radical\\npolitical theories and social experiments] while on duty. It's going to end\\nimmediately. Our Armed Forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission:\\ndefeating America's enemies.\\nLike in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever\\nseen. We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also\\nby the wars that we end and, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never\\nget into.\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.] That's what I\\nwant to be: a peacemaker and a unifier. I'm pleased to say that as of\\nyesterday, 1 day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East\\nare coming back home to their families. [Applause] Thank you.\\nAmerica will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most\\nrespected nation on Earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire\\nworld.\\n\\nA short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of\\nMexico to the Gulf of America, and we will restore the name of a great\\nPresident, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and\\nwhere it belongs.\\nPresident McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through\\ntalent\u2014he was a natural businessman\u2014and gave Teddy Roosevelt the\\nmoney for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal,\\nwhich has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United\\nStates\u2014the United States\u2014I mean, think of this\u2014spent more money than\\never spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the\\nPanama Canal.\\n[TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have\\nnever been made], and Panama's promise to us has been broken. The\\npurpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated.\\nAmerican ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any\\nway, shape, or form. And that includes the United States Navy.\\nAnd above all, [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn't give it to\\nChina. We gave it to Panama, and [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: we're taking it back].]\\nAbove all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once\\nagain act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history's greatest\\ncivilization.\\nSo, as we liberate our Nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and\\nsuccess. We will not be deterred. Together, we will end the chronic disease\\nepidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.\\nThe United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that\\nincreases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our\\nexpectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons.\\nAnd we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American\\nastronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.\\nAmbition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and, right now, our Nation is\\nmore ambitious than any other. There's no nation like our Nation.\\n\\nAmericans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers.\\nThe spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great\\nadventure resounds from within our souls.\\nOur American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a\\nvast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on\\nEarth. No one comes close.\\nAmericans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed\\nwilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold\\ndangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny,\\nlifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched\\nmankind into the heavens, and put the universe of human knowledge into\\nthe palm of the human hand. If we work together, there is nothing we\\ncannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.\\nMany people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic\\npolitical comeback. But as you see today, here I am. The American people\\nhave spoken. I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe\\nthat something is impossible to do. In America, the impossible is what we\\ndo best.\\nFrom New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago\\nto Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, DC, our country was\\nforged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they\\nhad for our rights and for our freedom.\\nThey were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers\\nand coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched\\nforward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.\\nTogether, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built\\ngreat highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism,\\nand triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.\\nAfter all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the 4\\ngreatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore America\\npromise and we will rebuild the nation that we love, and we love it so much.\\n\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.] So, to\\nevery parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for\\ntheir future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. We're\\ngoing to win like never before. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\\nThank you.\\nIn recent years, our Nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it\\nback and make it great again, greater than ever before. We will be a nation\\nlike no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism. Our power\\nwill stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been\\nangry, violent, and totally unpredictable.\\nAmerica will be respected again and admired again, including by people of\\nreligion, faith, and good will. We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we\\nwill be strong, and we will win like never before.\\nWe will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken,\\nand we will not fail. From this day on, the United States of America will be a\\nfree, sovereign, and independent nation.\\nWe will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing\\nwill stand in our way because we are Americans. The future is ours, and our\\ngolden age has just begun.\\nThank you. God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you very\\nmuch. Thank you very much. Thank you.\\nThank you.\\n\\nSwearing-In Ceremony of Donald J.
