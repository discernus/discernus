GAME THEORY: STATE OF PLAY
You might want to listen up for this one.

I’ll be touching on the subjects [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Trump, the GOP and the Global Mob have been avoiding] on the run up to impeachment and justice - [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: so we can block their last, desperate moves.]

First, remember that while the [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: American political system is driving inexorably toward impeaching Trump], he is but a symptom of the real crisis - a [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: coup against civilization by oligarchs around the world looking to rid themselves of liberal democracy.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: coup against civilization by oligarchs around the world looking to rid themselves of liberal democracy.]

Second, the real issue to which we must always return is [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: MONEY].

There are two economies: the above-board one in which you participate and pay taxes, and the SECOND one, which is largely secret and based on illegal activities, offshoring banking, and tax evasion.

The [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: tax evasion part of the second economy is the most damaging], but the least ugly. One of the reasons the [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: Global Mob] - which comprises [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: gangbangers, accountants, politicians and more] - [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: needs PR services is to conceal the ugly source of its wealth.]

**Eric Garland** @ericgarland [2019-11-22](https://x.com/ericgarland/status/1197872001924419584)

The ugly part is comprised of [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: cash flow from industrialized suffering: human trafficking, rape, forced labor, fraud, addiction, environmental degradation, and more.]

That second economy pays for [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: Putin, Trump, Erdogan, and every tinpot Mob boss now in charge of countries.] [PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: tinpot Mob boss]

While the U.S. House Intelligence Committee has been focused on the Trump-Ukraine attack on democracy, it has gone as far as it can, which is more than enough to impeach Trump.

The [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: GOP can’t even bear to *hear* these truths in public]- much less what underlies them. [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: GOP can’t even bear to *hear* these truths in public]

The [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: GOP - and similar parties around the world - know that the source of their power and position is either too ugly to examine, or they know damn well who they represent and that they have to defend them or face nasty consequences.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: GOP - and similar parties around the world - know that the source of their power and position is either too ugly to examine, or they know damn well who they represent and that they have to defend them or face nasty consequences.]

P.S. Don't for a second think that this is about Left vs Center vs Right.

When it's trillions at stake, [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: Bad Guys] don't leave their flanks unpurchased.

[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Every party has its issues. In some parties, they have nothing *but* Mob problems.]

**Eric Garland** @ericgarland [2019-11-22](https://x.com/ericgarland/status/1197874137261367296)

The current moment: in many countries around the world - Israel, Brazil, the UK, and many more - [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: true corruption, its connection, and its support structure are ready to burst through to the public consciousness.]

Get ready, because [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: this System is going to fight back HARD.]

Fact is, since the all-too-revealing—and accidental—election of Donald Trump, the System has still slogged forth, [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: trying its old tricks to cover up their ugly secrets: Divide people, push gauzy, positive false narratives, smear the reputations of truth tellers.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: smear the reputations of truth tellers.]

**Eric Garland** @ericgarland [2019-11-22](https://x.com/ericgarland/status/1197874521564418054)

[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: It didn’t work. It couldn’t work.]

[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Fact is, these corrupt politicians, PR whores, and financiers only got here because of that toolkit. It can’t *also* get them out of trouble.] [PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: corrupt politicians, PR whores]

**Eric Garland** @ericgarland [2019-11-22](https://x.com/ericgarland/status/1197874730382110722)

That doesn’t mean they won’t try.

[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Just like the GOP tried to smear Lt. Col. Vindman, Gordon Sondland (?!), and Dr. Fiona Hill (suicidally!) with the same partisan script as for democrats - they will try their old toolkit one last time.] Good and hard and [PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: DUMM].

**Eric Garland** @ericgarland [2019-11-22](https://x.com/ericgarland/status/1197874927283687424)

Here’s what to expect now that the [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: Bad Guys] cannot escape exposure: all of the same, but with a couple of added, likely hilarious features.

Ready?
