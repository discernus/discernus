The first presidential debate between President Trump and Joe Biden featured a [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: chaotic series of bitter exchanges and name-calling], with the president [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: repeatedly speaking over his Democratic rival] and the moderator struggling to maintain control of the 90-minute affair.  
  
[PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: "Will you shut up, man?"] an exasperated Biden said in a comment that was emblematic of the tumultuous nature of the debate, which was held in Cleveland, Ohio.

[PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: "Did you use the word smart?"] the president asked Biden at one point. [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: "You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class."] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: "Don't ever use the word smart with me, Joe."] [PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: "Don't ever use the word smart with me, Joe."]
