# Document Analysis - Marked Up Text

Brett Baer 0:00 
Thanks, Bill. I'm Brett Baer, live from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, alongside my co moderators Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace, with our partner Facebook, we welcome you to the Republican primary debate night on Fox, the first debates of the 2016 presidential campaign. By i

Megyn Kelly 0:26 
Tonight, the candidates you will see take the stage were selected based on their standing in an average of five national polls. Earlier tonight, you saw the candidates who ranked 11 through 17, and in just a few minutes, you will see the top 10

Chris Wallace 0:41 
along with the three of us here, our panel will be watching the debate in the media spin room, and let's bring them in right now for a preview, Brit Hume Kirsten powers and Steve Hayes Britt, starting with you thoughts about what we're about to see tonight. Well, the one thing I think we're going to see is a much more excited atmosphere,

Brit Hume 0:59 
because we can tell this from being adjacent to you in here, Chris, that the presence of this sizeable audience, which, from what we're hearing, sounds like the house is full. I know it's not.

Ted Cruz 1:19 
And I would simply add, obviously, that they're basically, they're two stories. One is what Donald Trump is going to do or not do and how the other candidates are going to act toward him. And then there's a question about how all of the candidates are going to fare when confronted with challenging questions about the issues and events of the day. And we'll see if anybody breaks out. We thought, we think that happened earlier with Carly Fiorina in the first debate, she did very well. Obviously, consensus choice as a winner. Obviously, any one of these people could use that kind of boost, including Jeb Bush, who's been thought to be kind of a overall front runner, but has made some recent missteps and he needs to recover. So a bunch of stories.

Kirsten 2:00 
Kirsten, your thoughts? Yeah, I mean, I think there's just incredible anticipation about this, partly because there's this wild card with Donald Trump. He's not a normal, regular politician on the stage, and so we're all sort of anticipating, waiting in anticipation, to see what he's going to do. And for Jeb Bush, who has, you know, I think it's an opportunity for him to break out and to maybe show a fire in the ballet, to show you know why he's running, why he's in the race. But I think that what's really why there's so much anticipation, as well as this is just a really interesting field. It's a very strong field of a lot of people that I think we're all interested to watch, to see. I think we wanted to watch you know Ted Cruz, who has this incredible reputation as a debater, Marco Rubio is charismatic rising star to really make their case.

Steve 2:46 
Art, Steve, what do you think I agree with Britt? I mean, I think the real story here is Donald Trump. Is he the Donald Trump that people came to know as the host of The Apprentice, the person who's been sort of bombastic and in the face of these other candidates and in sort of the face of the political system generally, or is he the more subdued Donald Trump that we've seen over the past several days? And then beyond that, is there another candidate who sort of steps up, who has a big night, who says, it says, in effect, I'm here, I'm running for president, and and you, I'm the one to watch. And then there will be third story, I think, as well. Is there a candidate in this field, particularly given the performance that we saw from Carly Fiorina tonight, who's at risk of not being on the stage in the debate in California. Is somebody really bombed tonight in a way that people are talking about

Brett Baer 3:32 
panel. Thank you very much. We'll check in after the debate. Let's go to Shannon Bream now. Hi Shannon.

Shannon Bream 3:38 
Hi Brian. Well, we have been partnering with Facebook. As you know, they've been measuring political conversation on Facebook the past two months, leading up to tonight, who's getting the most traffic, the most buzz, not necessarily positive or negative, but things like the most likes, interactions, shares, Donald Trump. This is his heat map. Check it out. Across the entire country. He's got a lot of heat along the border and in South Florida. Remember, he's been talking about immigration quite a bit. So if we go out and look at a very important state, which tonight is where we are tonight, Ohio, important for the debate, but also important for the person who wants to capture the nomination and go on to try to capture the White House, you can see the top five contenders. This is based on conversation here, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, the current governor who got in and got enough momentum to end up in the top 10 debate tonight, and Bernie Sanders the top issues here in Ohio, racial issues and the economy. That's pretty much a pattern we're seeing across the country, a big state. We'll see how these 10 do tonight.

Brett Baer 4:32 
Brett, Thank you, Shannon, you

Megyn Kelly 4:35 
know it's a fun night because the candidates are backstage and they are waiting to come out, lined up, one after the other, just like you know, you might do it a sport, sporting event.

Brett Baer 4:44 
We are in the arena that the Cleveland

Megyn Kelly 4:46 
Cavaliers play in. Well, we did our pregame warm up. We were in the locker room, like the actual locker room. These guys were like, This is it. This is where Lebron James. And I

Chris Wallace 4:55 
was gonna say LeBron James is the king, but tonight, we may find out who the new king is. So. But it's going to be very interesting, I got to tell you. And we've been doing these debates I have for three cycles, I have never seen a crowd as excited and hepped up as this one is.

Megyn Kelly 5:15 
So the candidates are all right behind that curtain, and they bring them out. Are about to come out. Why don't we bring them out? Would you like to see the candidates? Let's do it. And here they come. Stand by. Come on out. Guys. Jessica, coming back. Is it coming up? Their game plan back there. You know, we came. We have our game plan. Yeah, maybe they're conferring with each other, yeah, come on out. We're going to begin. We're just going to shout out the names with Ohio governor. You may be familiar with him, John Kasich, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, former

Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee,

Brett Baer 6:04 
former Florida governor Jeb Bush,

businessman Donald Trump, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker,

Chris Wallace 6:18 
retired neurosurgeon Dr Ben Carson, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and now all of the cameramen are taking their pictures. This is the fifth picture you'll see on the front page of the papers tomorrow, all the candidates standing together. We'll see who's talking to each other who's not talking

Speaker 1 6:41 
to each other. Well, that's awkward.

Chris Wallace 6:43 
Well, that was the whole point.

Megyn Kelly 6:46 
Don't stage the news. They're not feeling it. You guys nervous. We're a little nervous too.

Brett Baer 6:59 
That sounded like the buzzer.

Megyn Kelly 7:01 
We saved them from that buzzer. So basically,

in a moment, just so the audience understands, and the candidates know they're going to stand behind these lecterns, and we're going to give you the rules, which, of course, their campaigns have already been informed of. They know the rules, but we'll go over them again just one more time, and the audience will be brought up to speed, and then we'll get started with our

Chris Wallace 7:31 
questions. You know, it's so interesting, and I guess they all know this. They've been talking about each other a lot during the previous six months or so. Now they're going to get an opportunity to talk to each other. And obviously this is all part of the process of the American people here in this hall and across the nation trying to sort out who should be the Republican nominee for president in 2016 so this is part of the great American process.

Brett Baer 7:55 
All right, gentlemen, thank you. Please go to your podiums. That was awkward enough. Let's get you it's important to point out that this debate, obviously, is the top 10 in polling. They were chosen by the position from top to bottom in the positioning on the stage. And remember, we had another debate on this very stage from five to six that included seven other candidates. This is a huge field. That's right.

Megyn Kelly 8:27 
Bet these guys are glad that Carly Fiorina did not appear in the 9pm hour because, boy, she she unleashed a can. If you know what I'm saying earlier.

Chris Wallace 8:38 
Well, you know, that's the exciting thing, because, you know, there's been a lot of question, should it be divided? Should it not be divided? And yes, there were two tiers. There were the seven lowest in the polls. Now we have the top 10 in the polls, but, you know, it's a fluid process, and it was certainly true four years ago. Some that were in the lower tier are going to jump up, and perhaps some that are here tonight are going to slip down a little bit. But there's a long time between now and the snowy caucuses in February and Iowa.

Brett Baer 9:06 
We should point out our next debate is right before the Iowa caucuses, and it's going to be quite something.

Megyn Kelly 9:11 
This is, I think, going to be very meaningful. It would have been tough to have 17 candidates up here, as great as it would have been to try to find a way to do it, but it's would have been like herding cats

Brett Baer 9:21 
photos. I think that's it. All right, guys. All right. So the

Megyn Kelly 9:25 
audience knows we're going to restart at the top of the hour, because that is when the nation believes that this debate starts, not at 850 so we'll get it going at nine o'clock, and we'll have a clean start to the show, and we'll take it from there.

Brett Baer 9:36 
This audience has been great. We're going to talk about, you know the excitement and how we're going to make this all come together.

Megyn Kelly 9:59 
It is 9pm Pm on the East Coast, and the moment of truth has arrived. Welcome to the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign. Live from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. I'm Megyn Kelly, along with my co moderators, Brett Baer and Chris Wallace, tonight, nice tonight, 1000s of people here in the queue, along with millions of voters at home, will get their very first chance to see the candidates face off in a debate answering the questions you want answered

Brett Baer 10:34 
< less than a year from now, in this very arena, one of these 10 candidates or one of the seven on the previous debate tonight will accept the Republican Party's nomination. Tonight's candidates were selected based on an average of five national polls just a few hours ago. You heard from the candidates ranked 11 through 17, and now the prime time event the top 10

Chris Wallace 10:59 
Also of note, Fox News is Partnering For tonight's debate with Facebook. For the past several weeks, we've been asking you for questions for the candidates on Facebook. Nearly 6 million of you, 6 million viewed the debate videos on our site, and more than 40,000 of you submitted questions, some of which you will hear us asking the candidates tonight,

Megyn Kelly 11:24 
as for the candidates, who will be answering those questions, here they are positioned on the stage by how they stand in the polls in the center of the stage Tonight, businessman Donald Trump, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor

Scott Walker, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee,

Brett Baer 11:56 
neurosurgeon Dr Ben Carson, Texas Senator Ted Cruz,

John Kasich 12:05 
Florida Senator Marco Rubio,

Chris Wallace 12:11 
Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie and your very own governor of Ohio, John Kasich, Brett

Speaker 2 12:42 
you Brett,

Chris Wallace 12:44 
I think you would call that a home field advantage.

Brett Baer 12:47 
It might be, it might be, we'll see objections. It might be. The rules for tonight are simple, one minute for answers, 30 seconds for follow ups, and if a candidate runs over, you'll hear this pleasant, no. We also have a big crowd here with us tonight in the home of the Cavaliers, as I mentioned. And while we expect them, we expect them to be enthusiastic, as you heard, we don't want to take anything away from the valuable time for the candidates. So we're looking for somewhere between a reaction to a LeBron James dunk and the Cleveland Public Library across the street somewhere. There, we'll find a balance tonight. Without further ado, let's begin, gentlemen, we know how much you love hand raising questions, so we promise this is the only one tonight, the only one. Is there anyone on stage, and can I see hands who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican Party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person? Again, we're looking for you to raise your hand now. Raise your hand now, if you won't make that pledge tonight, Mr. Trump. So Mr. Trump, to be clear, you're standing on a Republican primary. I fully understand the place where the RNC will give the nominee the nod. I fully understand and that experts say an independent run would almost certainly hand the race over to Democrats and likely another Clinton. You can't say tonight that you can make that

Donald J. Trump 14:29 
pledge. I cannot say I have to respect the person that, if it's not me, the person that wins. If I do win, and I'm leading by quite a bit, that's what I want to do. I can totally make that pledge. If I'm the nominee, I will pledge. I will not run as an independent but, and I am discussing it with everybody, but I'm, you know, talking about a lot of leverage. We want to win, and we will win, but I want to win as the Republican. I want to run as the Republican nominee.

Brett Baer 14:57 
So tonight, you can't say if another one of the. Is what's

Speaker 2 15:00 
wrong. [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: What's wrong? He buys and sells politicians of all stripes. He's already, hey, he's already hedging his bet on the Clintons. Okay, so if he doesn't run as a Republican, maybe he supports Clinton, or maybe runs as an independent. But I'd say that he's already hedging his bets because he's used to buying politicians.]

Brett Baer 15:22 
Well, I've given him plenty of money, just to be clear. You can't make it. We're going to we're going to move on. You're not going to make the pledge tonight. I will not make

John Kasich 15:29 
the pledge at this time. Okay, all right,

Megyn Kelly 15:40 
gentlemen, our first round of questions is on the subject of electability in the general election, and we start tonight with you, Dr Carson, you are a successful neurosurgeon, but you admit that you have had to study up when it comes to foreign policy, saying there's a lot to learn. Your critics say that your inexperience shows you suggested that the Baltic states are not a part of NATO just months ago. You were unfamiliar with the major political parties and government in Israel and domestically, you thought Alan Greenspan had been Treasury Secretary instead of Federal Reserve Chair. Aren't these basic mistakes and don't they raise legitimate questions about whether you are ready to be President?

Dr. Ben Carson 16:21 
Well, I could take issue with with all of those things, but we don't have time. But I will say we have a debate here tonight, and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas, and I'm looking very much forward to demonstrating that. In fact, the thing that is probably most important is having a brain and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly. So, you know, experience comes from a large number of different arenas, and America became a great nation early on, not because it was flooded with politicians, but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation, and that's what will get us on the right track now, as well [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Well, I could take issue with with all of those things, but we don't have time. But I will say we have a debate here tonight, and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas, and I'm looking very much forward to demonstrating that.]

Chris Wallace 17:15 
Senator Rubio, when Jeb Bush announced his candidacy for presidency, he said this, there's no passing off responsibility when you're a governor, no blending into the legislative crowd. Could you please address Governor Bush across the stage here and explain to him why you, someone who has never held executive office, are better prepared to be president than he is a man who you say did a great job running your state of Florida for eight years.

Marco Rubio 17:42 
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Well, thank you for the question, Chris, and it's great to be here tonight.] Let me begin by saying this. I'm not new to the political process. I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate. I would add to that, that this election cannot be a resume competition. It's important to be qualified, but if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton is going to be the next president. Going to be the next president because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight, here's what this election better be about. This election better be about the future, not the past. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced. This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed. You know, the largest retailer in the country, in the world today, Amazon doesn't even own a single store, and these changes have been disruptive. They have changed people's lives. The jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don't pay enough, or they are gone. And we need someone that understands that is our nominee.] If I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton going to lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck. I was raised paycheck to paycheck. How is she? How is she going to lecture me? How is she going to lecture me about student loans I owed over $100,000 just four years ago. If I'm our nominee, we will be the party of the future. Governor Bush,

Brett Baer 19:00 
you have insisted that your own, your own man. You say you have a life experience uniquely your own, not your father's, not your brother's. But there are several opponents on this stage who get big applause lines in early voting states with this line quote, the last thing the country needs is another bush in the Oval Office. So do you understand the real concern in this country about dynastic politics?

Jeb Bush 19:27 
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Absolutely I do, and I'm going to run hard, run with heart and run to win. I'm going to have to earn this. Maybe the barrier, the bar is even higher for me. That's fine. I've got a record in Florida.] I'm proud of my dad and I'm certainly proud of my brother. In Florida, they call me Jeb because I earned it. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I cut taxes every year totaling $19 billion we were, we had, we balanced every budget. We went from $1 billion of reserves to $9 billion of reserves. We were one of two states that went to triple A bond rating. They keep. They called me veto Corleone because I vetoed. 2500 separate line items in the budget. I'm my own man. I governed as a conservative, and I governed effectively. And the net effect was, during my eight years, 1.3 million jobs were created. We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles in a purple state the right way, and people rose up the]

Megyn Kelly 20:25 
you, Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don't use a politician's filter. However, that is not without its downsides, in particular when it comes to women, [PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: You've called women you don't like fat, pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals,] your Twitter

Donald J. Trump 20:45 
account only. Rosie O'Donnell, no, it

Megyn Kelly 20:54 
wasn't your Twitter

account. [PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: Thank you for the record, it was well beyond Rosie, oh yes, your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women's looks. You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees.] [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president?] And how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who is likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?

John Kasich 21:28 
[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct. I've been I've been challenged by so many people. And I don't, frankly, have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn't have time either.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: This country is in big trouble. We don't win anymore. We lose to China. We lose to Mexico, both in trade and at the border. We lose to everybody.] And frankly, what I say, and oftentimes it's fun, it's kidding. We have a good time. What I say is what I say. And honestly, Megan, if you don't like it, I'm sorry. I've been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be based on the way you have treated me, but I wouldn't do that. But you know what? We we need strength. We need energy, we need quickness, and we need brain in this country to turn it around that I can tell you right now.

Chris Wallace 22:36 
Senator Cruz, your colleague, Senator Paul right there next to you said a few months ago, he agrees with you on a number of issues, but he says you do nothing to grow the party. He says you feed red meat to the base, but you don't reach out to minorities. You have a toxic relationship with GOP leaders in Congress. You even called the Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell a liar recently. How can you win in 2016 when you're such a divisive figure?

Ted Cruz 23:09 
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Chris, I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: If you're looking for someone to go to Washington, to go along, to get along, to get to agree with the career politicians in both parties, who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests, then I ain't your guy.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: There is a reason that we have $18 trillion in debt because as conservatives, as Republicans, we keep winning elections. We got a Republican House, we got a Republican Senate, and we don't have leaders who honor their commitments.] I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would

Brett Baer 24:02 
do. Governor, Christie,

you're not exactly the darling of conservatives. You tout your record as a Republican governor in a blue state on Facebook, the most people talking about you, not surprisingly, come from your state of New Jersey, and one of the top issues they are talking about is the economy this? This may be why, under your watch, New Jersey has undergone nine credit rating downgrades. The state's 44th in private sector growth. You face an employee pension crisis, and the Garden State has the third highest foreclosure rate in the country. So why should voters believe that your management of the country's finances would be any different

Chris Christie 24:46 
if you think it's bad now, you should have seen it when I got there. Fact is,

[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: fact is, in the eight years before I became governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times in. The eight years before I became governor, spending was increased 56% and in the eight years before I became governor, there was zero net private sector job growth in New Jersey, zero for eight years. So what did we do? We came in, we balanced an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget by cutting over 800 programs in the state budget. We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases. In fact, we vetoed five income tax increases during my time as governor. We cut business taxes $2.3 billion and we cut regulation by 1/3 of what my predecessor put in place. And what's happened since 192,000 new private sector jobs in the five and a half years I've been governor. We have a lot of work to do in New Jersey. But I am darn proud of how we brought our state back.]

Megyn Kelly 25:51 
Governor Walker, you have consistently said that you want to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. You recently signed an abortion law Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother's life, but you are on record as having objected to it. Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion? And with 83% of the American public in favor of a life exception, are you two out of the mainstream on this issue to win the general election?

Governor Walker 26:19 
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Well, I'm pro life. I've always been pro life, and I've got a position I think is consistent with many Americans out there in that, in that I believe that that is an unborn child that's in need of protection out there,] and I've said many a time that that unborn child can be protected, and there are many other alternatives that will also protect the life of that mother that's been consistently proven, [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: unlike Hillary Clinton, who has a radical position in terms of support for Planned Parenthood. I defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago, long before any of these videos came out, I've got a position that's in line with everyday America,]

Chris Wallace 26:54 
Governor Huckabee, like Governor Walker, you have staked out strong positions on social issues. You favor a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriages. You favor a constitutional amendment banning abortions, except for the life of the mother. Millions of people in this country agree with you. But according to the polls, and again, this is an electability question. According to the polls, more people don't. So how do you persuade enough Independents and Democrats to get elected in 2016

Mike Huckabee 27:25 
Chris, I disagree with the idea that the real issue is a constitutional amendment. That's a long and difficult process. I've actually taken a position that's bolder than that. A lot of people are talking about defunding Planned Parenthood, as if that's a huge game changer. I think it's time to do something even more bold. [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: I think the next president ought to invoke the fifth and 14th Amendments to the Constitution. Now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother's womb is a person at the moment of conception, the reason we know that it is is because of the DNA schedule that we now have clear scientific evidence on,] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: and this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child's fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law. It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being, and we change the policy to be pro life and protect children, instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like their parts to a Buick.] [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being, and we change the policy to be pro life and protect children, instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like their parts to a Buick.]

Brett Baer 28:31 
Senator Paul you recently blamed the rise of ISIS on Republican Hawks. You later said that that statement you could have said it better, but the statement went on and you said, quote, everything they have talked about in foreign policy, they have been wrong for the last 20 years. Why are you so quick to blame your own party?

Rand Paul 28:56 
First of all, only ISIS is responsible for the terrorism, only ISIS is responsible for the depravity, but we do have to examine, how are we going to defeat ISIS? I've got a proposal. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I'm the leading voice in America for not arming the allies of ISIS. I've been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS. ISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of US. Humvees. It's a disgrace. We ought to stop it. We shouldn't fund our enemies for goodness sakes.] So we didn't create ISIS. Ice cures created themselves, but we will stop them, and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them and by not arming them.

Megyn Kelly 29:50 
Governor Kasich, you chose to expand Medicaid in your state, unlike several other governors on this stage tonight, and it is already over budget by. Estimates costing taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion in just the first 18 months. You defended your Medicaid expansion by invoking God, saying To skeptics that when they arrive in heaven, St Peter isn't going to ask them how small they've kept government, but what they have done for the poor. Why should Republican voters, who generally want to shrink government, believe that you won't use your st Peter rationale to expand every government program?

John Kasich 30:26 
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Well, first of all, first of all, Megha. You should know that President Reagan expanded Medicaid three or four times. Secondly, I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio to do what to treat the mentally ill. 10,000 of them sit in our prisons. It cost $22,500 a year to keep them in prison. I'd rather get them their medication so they could lead a decent life. Secondly, we are rehabbing the drug addicted. 80% of the people in our prisons have addiction problems. We now treat them in the prisons, release them in the community, and the recidivism rate is 10% and everybody across this country knows that the tsunami of drugs is is threatening their very families, so we're treating them and getting them on their feet. And finally, the working poor, instead of them having come into the emergency rooms, where it costs more, where they're sicker and we end up paying, we brought a program in here to make sure that people could get on their feet.] And you know what? Everybody has a right to their God given purpose. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: And finally, our Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country. And finally, we went from 8 billion in the hole to 2 billion in the black. We've cut 5 billion in taxes, and we've grown 350,000 jobs.]

Chris Wallace 31:42 
Gentlemen, we're turning to a new subject that all of you have been talking about and some of you have been disagreeing about, and that is the issue of immigration. Governor Bush, you released a new plan this week on illegal immigration, focusing on enforcement, which some suggest is your effort to show that you're not soft on that issue. I want to ask you about a statement that you made last year about illegal immigrants, and here's what you said, they broke the law, but it's not a felony. It's an act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family. Do you stand by that statement, and do you stand by your support for earned legal status?

Jeb Bush 32:24 
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: I do. I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option. They want to provide for their family, but we need to control our border. It's not it's our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in. So I've written a book about this, and yet, this week, I did come up with a comprehensive strategy that really mirrored what we said in the book, which is that we need to deal with E verify. We need to deal with people that come with a legal visa and overstay. We need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement, border security. We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country. It is ridiculous and tragic that people are dying because of the fact that that local governments are not following the federal law. There's much to do.] And I think, rather than talking about this as a wedge issue, which Barack Obama's done now for six long years, the next president, and I hope to be that President, will fix this once and for all, so that we can turn this into a driver for high, sustained economic growth, and there should be a path to earn legal status for those that are here, not amnesty, earn legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time. Thank you, sir, Mr.

Chris Wallace 33:37 
Trump, it has not escaped anybody's notice that you say that you say that the Mexican government, the Mexican government, is sending criminals, rapists, drug dealers across the border. Governor Bush has called those remarks, quote, extraordinarily ugly. I'd like you. You're right next to him. Tell us, talk to him directly, and say how you respond to that and and you have repeatedly said that you have evidence that the Mexican government is doing this, but that you have evidence you have refused or declined to share. Why not use this first Republican presidential debate to share your proof with the American people?

John Kasich 34:17 
[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: So if it weren't for me, you wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration. Chris, you wouldn't even be talking about this was not a subject that was on anybody's mind until I brought it up at my announcement, and I said Mexico is sending except the reporters, because they're a very dishonest lot, generally speaking, in the world of politics, they didn't cover my statement the way I said it.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: The fact is, since then, many killings, murders, crime, drugs pouring across the border, are money going out and the drugs coming in. And I said, we need to build a wall. And it has to be built quickly, and I don't mind having a big, beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally, but we need Jeb to build a wall. We need to keep illegals out,] Mr.

Chris Wallace 35:20 
Trump, I'll give you 30 seconds. I'll give you 30 seconds to answer my question, which was, what evidence do you have? Specific evidence that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border? 30 seconds.

John Kasich 35:35 
Border Patrol. I was at the border last week. Border Patrol. People that I deal with, that I talk to, they say this is what's happening [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: because our leaders are stupid, our politicians are stupid, and the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning, and they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them. They don't want to take care of them. Why should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them,] and that's what's happening, whether you like it or not.

Chris Wallace 36:09 
All right, obviously, there's a lot more to talk about this. We're going to have more questions for the candidates on illegal immigration, plus other key topics, including your questions on Facebook.

Welcome back to Fox News. Facebook, Republican debate night. We're going to continue the questions now on illegal immigration. We kind of ended with a cliffhanger there. So let's continue the conversation. Governor Kasich, I know you don't like to talk about Donald Trump, but I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said. When you say that the American government is stupid, that the Mexican government is sending criminals, that we're being bamboozled, is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration Chris, first of all, I was

Steve 37:02 
just saying to chris Christie, they say we're outspoken. We need to take lessons from Donald Trump if we're gonna, if we're really gonna learn it. Here's the thing about Donald Trump. Donald Trump's hitting a nerve in this country. He is. He's hitting a nerve. People are frustrated. They're fed up. They don't think the government is working for him, and for people that want to just tune them out, they're making a mistake. Now, he's got his solutions. Some of us have other solutions. You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington. Hadn't been done since I was a military reformer. I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole and a 350,000 job loss to a $2 billion surplus and a gain of 350,000

Chris Wallace 37:47 
jobs. Respectfully. Can we talk about illegal but the point

Steve 37:50 
is, is that we all have solutions. Mr. Trump is touching a nerve because people want the wall to be built. They want to see an end to illegal immigration. They want to see and we all do, but we all have different ways of getting there, and you're going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are,

Chris Wallace 38:06 
all right. Well, Senator Rubio, let me see if I can do better with you. Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid, their leaders are smart, and all of these illegals coming over are criminals? Well, let me set

Megyn Kelly 38:19 
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: the record straight on a couple of things. The first is, the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. They're coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority.] I also believe we need a fence. The problem is, if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too, and that's why you need an E verify system, and you need an entry exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with the Governor Kasich. Governor Kasich just said, people are frustrated. [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we're being taken advantage of. We feel like, despite our generosity, we are being taken advantage of.] And let me tell you, who never gets talked about in these debates, the people that call my office who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States, and they paid their fees and they hired a lawyer, and they can't get in, and they're wondering maybe they should come illegally. And so these are important issues, and we should address it. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and otherwise we're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years, like we have for the last 30 years.

Chris Wallace 39:25 
Governor Walker. Governor Walker, from 2002 until as recently as 2013 just two years ago, you supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship. Now you say that was a quick reaction to something you hadn't really thought about, and that you've changed your mind other than politics, could you explain why in the last two years you've changed your position on a path to citizenship, and are there other past positions that we shouldn't hold you to?

Yeah, well, Chris, I actually said it on your show earlier this year. I. Flat out, said, I acknowledge that. I said I actually listened to the American people. And I think people across America want a leader who's actually going to listen to them. I talked to border state governors and other elected officials. I looked at how this president, particularly through last November, messed up the immigration system this country. Most importantly, I listened to the people of America. I believe we need to secure the border. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I've been to the border with Governor Abbott and Texas and others seeing the problems they have there. There's international criminal organizations penetrating our southern based borders, and we need to do something about it, secure the border, enforce the law, no amnesty, and go forward the legal immigration system that gives priority to American working families and wages.]

Senator Cruz, some 1400 people submitted questions on this very hot topic of illegal immigration on Facebook, and a number of them were about the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco, allegedly shot down by an illegal Doug Bettencourt sent this question, Will you support Kate steinle's law, which would impose a mandatory five year prison term for an illegal who's deported and then returns to this country. And will you defund sanctuary cities for violating federal law? Chris, absolutely, yes. And not only will I support it,

Ted Cruz 41:18 
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I have authored Kate's law in the United States Senate and filed that legislation, I tried to get the Senate to vote to pass Kate's law on the floor of the Senate just one week ago, and the leader of our own party blocked a vote on Kate's law.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: You know, there was reference made to our leaders being stupid. It's not a question of stupidity, it's that they don't want to enforce the immigration laws that there are far too many in the Washington cartel that support amnesty.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: President Obama has talked about fundamentally transforming this country. There are 7 billion people across the face of the globe, many of whom want to come to this country. If they come legally, great, but if they come illegally and they get amnesty, that is how we fundamentally change this country,] and it really is striking. A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty. I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer's Gang of Eight amnesty legislation in the Senate.

Megyn Kelly 42:22 
The right, gentlemen, we're going to switch topics now and talk a bit about terror and national security. Governor Christie, you have said that Senator Paul's opposition to the NSA collection of phone records has made the United States weaker and more vulnerable, even going so far as to say that he should be called before Congress to answer for it if we should be hit by another terrorist attack. Do you really believe you can assign blame to Senator Paul just for opposing the bulk collection of people's phone records in the event of a terrorist attack?

Chris Christie 42:53 
[TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: Yes, I do, and I'll tell you why, because I'm the only person on this stage who's actually filed applications under the Patriot Act, who have gone before the federal the Foreign Intelligence Service court who has prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country. After September 11, I was appointed US attorney by President Bush on September 10, 2001 and the world changed enormously the next day, and it happened in my state. This is not theoretical to me. I went to the funerals we lost friends of ours in the Trade Center that day. My own wife was two blocks from the Trade Center that day at her office, having gone through it that morning, when you actually have to be responsible for doing this, you can do it, and we did it for seven years in my office, respecting civil liberties and protecting the homeland, and I will make no apologies ever for protecting the lives and the safety of the American people.] We have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that, not fewer, and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way as President, that is exactly what I'll do.

Rand Paul 43:56 
Megan, May I respond? Go ahead, sir. The I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans. The fourth amendment was what we fought the Revolution over. John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence. [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: And I'm proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights.]

Chris Christie 44:25 
And Megan. Megan, that's a, [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: you know, that's a completely ridiculous answer. I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from other people. How are you supposed to know, Megan, what are you supposed to how are you supposed to support?]

Listen, Senator. You

Megyn Kelly 44:45 
know, when you're

Chris Christie 44:46 
[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: sitting in a subcommittee just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that. When you're responsible for protecting the lives of the American people, then what you need to do is to make sure. Is to make sure that. Here's the way it's supposed to work.]

Speaker 2 45:02 
[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Problem, Governor, you fundamentally misunderstand the Bill of Rights. Every time you did a case, you got a warrant from a judge. I'm talking about searches without warrants indiscriminately of all Americans records, and that's what I thought to end.] [PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: I don't trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, and]

Chris Christie 45:30 
And you know, you know Senator Paul, Senator Paul, you know the hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on September 11. Those are the hugs I remember, and those had nothing to do, and those had nothing to do with politics, [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: unlike what you're doing by cutting speeches on the floor of the Senate then putting them on the internet within a half an hour to raise money for your campaign, and while still putting our country at risk,]

Megyn Kelly 45:54 
we have plenty where we want to get to. That was an interesting exchange. Thank you for that. I want to move on, because I have we're going to get to Governor, but I really want to get to a Facebook questioner. His name is Alex Shelburne, and he has the following question.

Rand Paul 46:11 
My question is, how would the candidates stop the treacherous actions of ISIS ISIL and its growing influence in the US if they were to become President?

Megyn Kelly 46:21 
Senator Cruz, I want to talk to you about this, because many of the Facebook users and the folks on Facebook wanted the candidates to speak to ISIS tonight, you asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs a question, what would it take to destroy ISIS in 90 days? He told you, ISIS will only be truly destroyed once they are rejected by the populations in which they hide. And then you accused him of pushing Medicaid for the Iraqis. How would you destroy ISIS in 90 days?

Ted Cruz 46:48 
[TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: Megan, we need a commander in chief that speaks the truth. We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words radical Islamic terrorism.]

[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: When I asked General Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Whatcott, militarily to destroy ISIS, he said there is no military solution. We need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization, that, with all due respect, is nonsense. It's the same answer the State Department gave that we need to give them jobs.] What we need is a commander in chief who makes care clear. If you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant.

Megyn Kelly 47:43 
ideological problem, an ideological problem in addition to a military one.

Shannon Bream 47:50 
Megan, of course, it's an ideological problem. That's one of the reasons why I introduced the expatriate terrorist act in the Senate that said, if any American travels to the Middle East and joins isis that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they don't use a passport to come back and wage jihad on Americans. Yes, it is ideological. [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: And let me contrast President Obama, who, at the prayer breakfast, essentially acted as an apologist. He said, Well, gosh, the Crusades, the inquisitions, we need a president that shows the courage that Egypt's President Al Sisi did a Muslim when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world.]

Megyn Kelly 48:33 
Governor Bush for days on end in this campaign, you struggled to answer a question about whether knowing what we know now, would have invaded Iran. I remember it too, and ISIS, of course, is now thriving there. You finally said no to the families of those who died in that war who say they liberated a country and deposed a ruthless dictator. How do you look at them now and say your brother's war was a mistake,

Jeb Bush 49:02 
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: knowing what we know now, with faulty intelligence and not having security be the first priority when we invaded, it was a mistake. I wouldn't have gone in. However, for the people that did lose their lives and the families that suffered because of it, I know this full well, because as governor of the state of Florida, I called every one of them, every one of them that I could find, to tell them that I was praying for them, that I cared about them. And it was very hard to do. And every one of them said that their child did not die in vain, or their their wife or husband did not die in vain. And so why it was difficult for me to do, it was based on that.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Here's the lesson that we should take from this which relates to this whole subject, Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq, he left, and when he left, al Qaeda was done for ISIS was created because of the void that we left, and that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana. To honor the people that died, we need to. We need to stop the Iran agreement for sure, because the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands, and we need to take out ISIS with every tool at our disposal.]

Megyn Kelly 50:10 
Governor Walker, in February, you said that we needed to gain partners in the Arab world. Which Arab country not already in the US led coalition has the potential to be our greatest partner.

Chris Wallace 50:23 
What about additional ones? We need to focus on the ones we have. You look at Egypt, probably the best relationship we've had in Israel, at least in my lifetime. Incredibly important. You look at the Saudis. Fact, earlier this year, I met with Saudi leaders and leaders from the United Arab Emirates, and I asked them, what's the greatest challenge in the world today? Set aside the Iran deal. [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: They said it's the disengagement of America. We are leading from behind under the Obama Clinton doctrine,] America is a great country. We need to stand up and start leading in and we'd have allies, not just in Israel, but throughout the Persian Gulf.

Megyn Kelly 50:54 
Dr Carson in one of his first acts as Commander in Chief, President Obama signed an executive order banning enhanced interrogation techniques in fighting terror. As President, would you bring back waterboarding?

Dr. Ben Carson 51:07 
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Thank you, Megan. I wasn't sure I was going to get to talk again.]

Megyn Kelly 51:10 
We have a lot for you. Don't worry.

Dr. Ben Carson 51:16 
[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: You may Rue that request. You know what we do in order to get the information that we need is our business, and I wouldn't necessarily be broadcasting to everybody what we're going to do.] You know, we we've gotten into this, this mindset of fighting politically correct wars. There is no such thing as a politically correct war. The left, of course, will say, Carson doesn't believe in the Geneva Convention. Carson doesn't believe in fighting stupid wars. And what we have to remember is, we want to utilize the tremendous intellect that we have in the military to win wars. And I've talked to a lot of the generals, a lot of our advanced people, and believe me, if we gave them the mission, which is what the commander in chief does, they would be able to carry it out. And if we don't tie their hands behind their back, they will do it extremely effectively,

Brett Baer 52:24 
gentlemen, the next series of questions deals with Obamacare and the role of the federal government. Mr. Trump, Obamacare is one of the things you call a disaster, complete disaster, saying it needs to be repealed and replaced. Correct now, 15 years ago, you called yourself a liberal on health care. You were for a single payer system, a Canadian style system. Why were you for that then, and why aren't you for it?

John Kasich 52:52 
Now, first of all, [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: I'd like to just go back to one in July of 2004 I came out strongly against the war with Iraq, because it was going to destabilize the Middle East. And I'm the only one of the stage that knew that and had the vision to say it, and that's exactly what happened.] The Middle East became totally destabilized. So I just want to say, as far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you're talking about here. What I'd like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state. I have a big company with 1000s and 1000s of employees. And if I'm negotiating in New York or New Jersey or in California, I have like, one bidder, nobody can bid. You know why? [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Because the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians, of course, with the exception of the politicians of this stage, but they have total control of the politicians. They're making a fortune.] Get rid of the artificial lines, and you will have yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people that can't take care of themselves, and I will do that through a different system. Hey, Mr.

Brett Baer 54:00 
Trump. Hold on one second. News flash, I know. Hold on.

Rand Paul 54:04 
[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: News flash, the Republican Party's been fighting against a single payer system for a decade. See, I think you're on the wrong side of this if you're still arguing for a single payer] I'm not.

John Kasich 54:13 
[PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: I'm not. I don't think you heard me. You're having a hard time tonight, Mr.]

Brett Baer 54:16 
Trump, it's not just your past support for single payer health care. You've also supported a host of other liberal policies. You've also donated to several Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton, included Nancy Pelosi. You explained away those donations, saying you did that to get business related favors, and you said recently, quote, when you give they do whatever the hell you want them to do,

John Kasich 54:44 
[TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: you better believe it. So what specifically did they do? If I ask them, if I need them? You know, most of the people on this stage I've given to just so you understand, a lot of money, not me, but]

Brit Hume 54:58 
you're welcome to give me a. Jack, Donald,

Megyn Kelly 55:00 
actually, to be clear,

Steve 55:03 
Charlie Crist, not Mike. Charlie, I have Donald at the end.

John Kasich 55:07 
I hope you will give to me good. Sounds good. Sounds good to me, Governor, I will tell you that our system is broken. I give to many people before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody when they call, I give. And you know what, when I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me. So that's a broken system. What'd you get from Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi? Well, I'll tell you what. With Hillary Clinton, I said, be at my wedding, and she came to my wedding. You know why? She had no choice, because I gave. [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good. I didn't know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world. It was] But President

Brett Baer 55:51 
Trump, hold on. We're going to we're going to move on. We'll come back to you, governor,

Chris Wallace 55:54 
just one second on this though, we spend a lot of time talking about Hillary Clinton and pitting us back and forth. Let's be clear, we should be talking about Hillary Clinton on that last subject, [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: because everywhere in the world that Hillary Clinton touched is more messed up today than before she we]

Brett Baer 56:07 
have many questions to come. Many questions to come. Governor Huckabee on Facebook, John Chris Rioni asks this, will you abolish or take away the powers and cut the size of the EPA, the IRS, the Department of Education. Now broadly, broadly, the size of government is a big concern for Facebook users, Facebook persons, as well as, obviously, conservatives. But year after year, decade after decade, there are promises from Republicans to shrink government, but year after year, decade after decade, it doesn't happen. In fact, it gets bigger, even under Republican politicians. So the question is, at this point, is the government simply too big for any one person, even a Republican, to

Brit Hume 56:52 
shrink? [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: It's not too big to shrink. But the problem is, we have a Wall Street to Washington, axis of power that has controlled the political climate. The donor class feeds the political class. Who does the dance that the donor class wants? And the result is federal government keeps getting bigger.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Every person on this stage who has been a governor will tell you that the biggest fight they had was not the other party. Wasn't even the legislature. It was the federal government who continually put mandates on the states that we had to suck up and pay for. And the fact is, there are a lot of things happening at the federal level that are absolutely beyond the jurisdiction of the Constitution. This is power that should be shifted back to the states, whether it's the EPA. There is no role at the federal level for the Department of Education, and I'm still one who says that we can get rid of the Internal Revenue Service if we would pass the fair tax, which is a tax on consumption rather than a tax on people's income, and move power back where the founders believed it should have been all along.] Dr Carson.

Brett Baer 57:56 
Dr Carson, do you agree with that?

Dr. Ben Carson 57:59 
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: What I agree with is that we need a significantly changed taxation system, and the one that I've advocated is based on tithing, because I think God's pretty fair guy. And he said, you know, if you give me a tithe, it doesn't matter how much you made. If you had a bumper crop, you don't owe me triple tithes, and you had no crops at all. You don't owe me no ties. So there must be something inherently fair about that, and that's why I've advocated a proportional tax system. You make $10 billion you pay a billion. You make $10 you pay one and everybody gets treated the same way. And you get rid of the deductions, you get rid of all the loopholes.] Governor Bush and I have a lot more to say about it.

Brett Baer 58:43 
We're going to come back to you. Dr Carson, Governor Bush, you are one of the few people on this stage who advocates for Common Core education standards reading and math. A lot of people on this stage vigorously oppose federal involvement in education. They say it should all be handled locally. President Obama's Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, has said that most of the criticism of Common Core is due to a quote, fringe group of critics. Do you think that's accurate?

Speaker 3 59:12 
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: No, I don't, and I don't believe the federal government should be involved in the creation of standards, directly or indirectly, the creation of curriculum or content. That is clearly a state responsibility. I'm for higher standards, measured in an intellectually honest way, with abundant school choice, ending social promotion. And I know how to do this, because as governor of the state of Florida, I created the first statewide voucher program in the country, the second statewide voucher program in the country, and the third statewide voucher program in the country, and we had rising student achievement across the board because high standards, robust accountability, ending social promotion in third grade, real school choice across the board, challenging the teachers union and beating them is the way to go. And Florida's low income kids had the greatest gains in. Inside the country, our graduation rate improved by 50% that's what I'm for.] Senator Rubio, why

Brett Baer 1:00:05 
is Governor Bush wrong on Common Core?

Megyn Kelly 1:00:08 
Well, first, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I too, believe in curriculum reform. It's critically important in the 21st Century. We do need curriculum reform, and it should happen at the state and local level the way, that's where, that's where, that is where educational policy belongs, because if a parent is unhappy with what their child is being taught in school, they can go to that local school board or their state legislature or their governor and get it changed.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Here's the problem with common core, the Department of Education, like every federal agency, will never be satisfied. They will not stop with it being a suggestion. They will turn it into a mandate. In fact, what they will begin to say to local communities is you will not get federal money unless you do things the way we want you to do it, and they will use common core, or any other requirements that exist nationally to force it down the throats of our people in our states.]

Brett Baer 1:00:51 
And you agree with your old friend, he

Speaker 3 1:00:55 
is definitely my friend, and I think the states ought to create these standards. And if states want to opt out of Common Core? Fine, just make sure your standards are high, [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: because today in America, a third of our kids, after we spend more per student than any country in the world, other than a couple of rounding errors, to be honest with you, 30% are college andor career ready. If we are going to compete in this world we're in today, there's no possible way we can do it with lowering expectations and dumbing down everything. Children are going to suffer and families hearts are going to be broken that their kids won't be able to get a job in the 21st Century.]

Brett Baer 1:01:29 
We have many more questions coming on a host of topics here, from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, stay with us.

Speaker 2 1:01:39 
What would make you stand out as the best choice for the Republican nomination.

Donald J. Trump 1:01:43 
How do you intend to go about student loan reform? What will be the first thing you will do to stimulate economic growth in our country and bring more jobs to the United States?

Chris Wallace 1:02:01 
Senator Cruz, some 1400 people submitted questions on this very hot topic of illegal immigration on Facebook, and a number of them were about the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco, allegedly shot down by an illegal Doug Bettencourt sent this question, Will you support Kate steinle's law, which would impose a mandatory five year prison term for an illegal who is deported and then returns to this country? And will you defund sanctuary cities for violating federal

Shannon Bream 1:02:33 
law? [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Chris, absolutely, yes. And not only will I support it, I have authored Kate's law in the United States Senate and filed that legislation, I tried to get the Senate to vote to pass Kate's law on the floor of the Senate just one week ago, and the leader of our own party blocked a vote on Kate's law.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: You know, there was reference made to our leaders being stupid. It's not a question of stupidity. It's that they don't want to enforce the immigration laws that there are far too many in the Washington cartel that support amnesty.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: President Obama has talked about fundamentally transforming this country. There are 7 billion people across the face of the globe, many of whom want to come to this country if they come legally, great, but if they come illegally and they get amnesty, that is how we fundamentally change this country,] and it really is striking. A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty. I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer's Gang of Eight amnesty legislation in the Senate.

Megyn Kelly 1:03:41 
All right, gentlemen, we're going to switch topics now and talk a bit about terror and national security. Governor Christie, you have said that Senator Paul's opposition to the NSA collection of phone records has made the United States weaker and more vulnerable, even going so far as to say that he should be called before Congress to answer for it if we should be hit by another terrorist attack. Do you really believe you can assign blame to Senator Paul just for opposing the bulk collection of people's phone records in the event of a terrorist attack?

Chris Christie 1:04:15 
[TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: Yes, I do, and I'll tell you why, because I'm the only person on this stage who's actually filed applications under the Patriot Act, who have gone before the federal the Foreign Intelligence Service court, who has prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country. After September 11, I was appointed US attorney by President Bush on September 10, 2001 and the world changed enormously the next day, and it happened in my state. This is not theoretical to me. I went to the funerals. We lost friends of ours in the Trade Center that day. My own wife was two blocks from the Trade Center that day, at her office, having gone through it that morning, when you actually have to be responsible for doing this, you can do it. And we did it for seven years in my office, respected. Civil liberties and protecting the homeland, and I will make no apologies ever for protecting the lives and the safety of the American people.] We have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that, not fewer, and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way as President, that is exactly what I'll do. Megan, May I respond? Go ahead, sir. Go ahead,

Speaker 2 1:05:24 
sir, I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans. The fourth amendment was what we fought the Revolution over. John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence, [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: and I'm proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights.]

Chris Christie 1:05:46 
And Megan. Megan, that's a, [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: you know, that's a completely ridiculous answer. I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from other people. How are you supposed to know, Megan? How are you supposed to support let me]

Speaker 1 1:06:03 
tell you so the senator,

Megyn Kelly 1:06:06 
make your point.

Chris Christie 1:06:07 
[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Listen, Senator, you know, when you're sitting in a subcommittee just blowing hot air about this, you can say things like that. When you're responsible for protecting the lives of the American people, then what you need to do is to make sure. Is to make sure that here's your problem the way it's supposed]

Speaker 2 1:06:23 
[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: to work. Problem, Governor, you fundamentally misunderstand the Bill of Rights. Every time you did a case, you got a warrant from a judge. I'm talking about searches without warrants, indiscriminately of all Americans records, and that's what I thought to end.] [PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: I don't trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again.]

Chris Christie 1:06:51 
And you know, you know Senator Paul, Senator Paul, you know the hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on September 11. Those are the hugs I remember, and those had nothing to do. And those had nothing to do with politics. [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Unlike what you're doing by cutting speeches on the floor of the Senate then putting them on the internet within a half an hour to raise money for your campaign, and while still putting our country at risk,]

Megyn Kelly 1:07:16 
we have plenty where we want to get to. That was an interesting exchange. Thank you for that. I want to move on, because I have, we're going to get to you, governor, but I really want to get to a Facebook questioner. His name is Alex Shelburne, and he has the following question.

Rand Paul 1:07:32 
My question is, how would the candidates stop the treacherous actions of ISIS ISIL and its growing influence in the US if they were to become President,

Megyn Kelly 1:07:42 
Senator Cruz, I want to talk to you about this, because many of the Facebook users and the folks on Facebook wanted the candidates to speak to ISIS tonight. You asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs a question, what would it take to destroy ISIS in 90 days? He told you, ISIS will only be truly destroyed once they are rejected by the populations in which they hide, and then you accused him of pushing Medicaid for the Iraqis. How would you destroy ISIS in 90 days?

Shannon Bream 1:08:09 
[TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: Megan? We need a commander in chief that speaks the truth. We will not defeat radical Islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words radical Islamic terrorism.]

[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: When I asked General Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Whatcott, militarily, to destroy ISIS, he said, There is no military solution. We need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization, that with all due respect, is nonsense. It's the same answer the State Department gave that we need to give them jobs.] What we need is a commander in chief who makes care clear, if you join ISIS, if you wage jihad on America, then you are signing your death warrant.

Megyn Kelly 1:09:03 
You don't see it as an ideological problem, an ideological problem in addition to a military one.

Shannon Bream 1:09:11 
Megan, of course, it's an ideological problem. That's one of the reasons why I introduced the expatriate terrorist act in the Senate that said, if any American travels to the Middle East and joins isis that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they don't use a passport to come back and wage jihad on Americans. Yes, it is ideological. [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: And let me contrast President Obama, who, at the prayer breakfast, essentially acted as an apologist. He said, Well, gosh, the Crusades, the inquisitions. We need a president that shows the courage that Egypt's President Al Sisi did a Muslim when he called out the radical Islamic terrorists who are threatening the world.]

Megyn Kelly 1:09:54 
Governor Bush for days on end in this camp. Pain, you struggled to answer a question about whether knowing what we know now, would have invaded Iran. I remember it too, and ISIS, of course, is now thriving there. You finally said no to the families of those who died in that war who say they liberated a country and deposed a ruthless dictator. How do you look at them now and say your brother's war was a mistake,

Speaker 3 1:10:24 
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: knowing what we know now with faulty intelligence and not having security be the first priority when we invaded, it was a mistake. I wouldn't have gone in. However, for the people that did lose their lives and the families that suffered because of it, I know this full well, because as governor of the state of Florida, I called every one of them, every one of them that I could find, to tell them that I was praying for them, that I cared about them. And it was very hard to do. And every one of them said that their child did not die in vain, or their wife or husband did not die in vain. And so why it was difficult for me to do, it was based on that.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Here's the lesson that we should take from this which relates to this whole subject. Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq, he left, and when he left, al Qaeda was done for ISIS was created because of the void that we left, and that void now exists as a caliphate the size of Indiana. To honor the people that died. We need to, we need to stop the Iran agreement for sure, because the Iranian mullahs have their blood on their hands, and we need to take out ISIS with every tool at our disposal.]

Megyn Kelly 1:11:32 
Governor Walker, in February, you said that we needed to gain partners in the Arab world. Which Arab country not already in the US led coalition has the potential to be our greatest partner.

Chris Wallace 1:11:44 
What about additional ones? We need to focus on the ones we have. You look at Egypt, probably the best relationship we've had in Israel, at least in my lifetime. Incredibly important. You look at the Saudis. Fact, earlier this year, I met with Saudi leaders and leaders from the United Arab Emirates, and I asked them, what's the greatest challenge in the world today. Set aside the Iran deal. [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: They said it's the disengagement of America. We are leading from behind under the Obama Clinton doctrine.] America is a great country. We need to stand up and start.

Brett Baer 1:12:11 
Thanks, Bill. I'm Bret Baier, live from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, alongside my co moderators Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace, with our partner, Facebook, we welcome you to the Republican primary debate night on Fox, the first debates of the 2016 presidential campaign.

Megyn Kelly 1:12:38 
Tonight, the candidates you will see take the stage, were selected based on their standing in an average of five national polls. Earlier tonight, you saw the candidates who ranked 11 through 17, and in just a few minutes, you will see the top 10,

Chris Wallace 1:12:52 
along with the three of us here, our panel will be watching the debate in the media spin room, and let's bring them in right now for a preview. Brit Hume, Kirsten powers and Steve James Britt, starting with you thoughts about what we're about to see tonight. Well, the one

Speaker 4 1:13:07 
thing I think we're going to see is a much more excited atmosphere, because we can tell just from being adjacent to you in here, Chris, that the presence of this sizeable audience, which, from what we're hearing, sounds like the house is full. I know it's not, is going to make a big difference.

Ted Cruz 1:13:30 
And I would simply add, obviously, that they're basically, they're two stories. One is what Donald Trump is going to do or not do, and how the other candidates are going to act toward him. And then there's a question about how all of the candidates are going to fare when confronted with challenging questions about the issues and events of the day, and we'll see if anybody breaks out. We thought, we think that happened earlier with Carly Fiorina in the first debate, she did very well. Obviously, consensus choice as a winner. Obviously, any one of these people could use that kind of boost, including Jeb Bush, who's been thought to be kind of a overall front runner, but has made some recent missteps, and he needs to recover. So a bunch of stories.

Kirsten 1:14:11 
Kirsten, your thoughts, yeah. I mean, I think there's just incredible anticipation about this, partly because there's this wild card with Donald Trump. He's not a normal, regular politician on the stage. And so we're all sort of anticipating, waiting in anticipation, to see what he's going to do. And for Jeb Bush, who has, you know, I think it's, it's an opportunity for him to break out and to maybe show a fire in the ballet, to show you know why he's running, why he's in the race. But I think the what's really why there's so much anticipation, as well as well. So this is just a really interesting field. It's a very strong field of a lot of people that I think we're all interested to watch, to see. I think we wanted to watch Ted Cruz, who has this incredible reputation as a debater, Marco Rubio, who's this charismatic rising star to really make their case.

Governor Walker 1:14:57 
Art, Steve, what do you think I agree with? Britt. I mean, I think the real story here is Donald Trump. Is he the Donald Trump that people came to know as the host of The Apprentice, the person who's been sort of bombastic and in the face of these other candidates and in sort of the face of the political system generally, or is he the more subdued Donald Trump that we've seen over the past several days? And then beyond that, is there another candidate who sort of steps up, who has a big night, who says, it says, in effect, I'm here, I'm running for president and and you, I'm the one to watch. And then there will be third story, I think, as well. Is there a candidate in this field, particularly given the performance that we saw from Carly Fiorina tonight, who's at risk of not being on the stage in the debate in California? Does somebody really bombed tonight in a way that people are talking about panel.

Brett Baer 1:15:44 
Thank you very much. We'll check in after the debate. Let's go to Shannon Bream now. Hi Shannon.

Shannon Bream 1:15:49 
Hi Brian. Well, we have been partnering with Facebook. As you know, they've been measuring political conversation on Facebook the past two months leading up to tonight. Who's getting the most traffic, the most buzz, not necessarily positive or negative, but things like the most likes, interactions, shares, Donald Trump. This is his heat map. Check it out. Across the entire country. He's got a lot of heat along the border and in South Florida. Remember, he's been talking about immigration quite a bit. So if we go out and look at a very important state, which tonight is where we are tonight, Ohio, important for the debate, but also important for the person who wants to capture the nomination and go on to try to capture the White House. You can see the top five contenders. This is based on conversation here, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, the current governor who got in and got enough momentum to end up in the top 10 debate tonight, and Bernie Sanders, the top issues here in Ohio, racial issues and the economy. That's pretty much a pattern we're seeing across the country, a big state. We'll see how these 10 do tonight.

Brett Baer 1:16:43 
Brett, thank you. Shannon, you know it's

Megyn Kelly 1:16:46 
a fun night because the candidates are backstage and they are waiting to come out, lined up, one after the other, just like you might do at a sport, sporting event.

Brett Baer 1:16:56 
We are in the arena that the Cleveland Cavaliers play in.

Megyn Kelly 1:16:59 
Well, we did our pregame warm up. We were in the locker room, like the actual locker room. These guys were like, This is it. This is where Lebron James.

Chris Wallace 1:17:06 
And I was gonna say LeBron James is the king, but tonight, we may find out who the new king is. So it's gonna be very interesting, I gotta tell you. And we've been doing these debates I have for three cycles. I have never seen a crowd as excited and hepped up as this one. Is what

Ted Cruz 1:17:20 
so

Megyn Kelly 1:17:24 
the candidates are all right behind that curtain, and they bring them out. Are about to come out. Why don't we bring them out? Would you like to see the candidates? Let's do it.

And here they come. Stand by. Come on out guys. You think they're coming back, they're coming up. Their game plan back there. You know, we came we have our game

Brett Baer 1:17:50 
plan. Yeah? Maybe they're conferring with each

Megyn Kelly 1:17:52 
other, yeah, come on out. We're gonna begin. We're just gonna shout out the names with Ohio governor. You may be familiar with him, John Kasich, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, Texas Senator Ted Cruz,

former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee,

Brett Baer 1:18:16 
former Florida governor Jeb Bush,

businessman Donald Trump, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker,

Chris Wallace 1:18:29 
retired neurosurgeon Dr Ben Carson, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and now all of the cameramen are taking their pictures. This is the fifth picture you'll see on the front page of the papers tomorrow, all the candidates standing together. We'll see who's talking to each other, who's not talking to each other. Well, that's awkward. Well, that was the whole point.

Megyn Kelly 1:18:57 
Don't stage the news. They're not feeling it. You guys nervous. We're a little nervous too. That sounded like the buzzer. We saved them from that buzzer. You Jeff, so

basically, in a moment, just so the audience understands and the candidates know, they're going to stand behind these lecterns, and we're going to give you the rules, which, of course, their campaigns have already been informed of. They know the rules, but we'll go over them again just one more time, and the audience will be brought up to speed, and then we'll get started with our questions. You know?

Chris Wallace 1:19:42 
Questions. You know, it's so interesting, and I guess they all know this, they've been talking about each other a lot during the previous six months or so. Now they're going to get an opportunity to talk to each other. And obviously this is all part of the process of the American people here in this hall and across the nation trying to. Sort out who should be the Republican nominee for president in 2016 so this is part of the great American process.

Brett Baer 1:20:06 
All right, gentlemen, thank you. Please go to your podiums. That was awkward enough. Let's get you. It's important to point out that this debate, obviously is the top 10 in polling. They were chosen by the position from top to bottom in the positioning on the stage. And remember, we had another debate on this very stage from five to six that included seven other candidates. This is a huge field.

Megyn Kelly 1:20:37 
That's right. Bet these guys are glad that Carly Fiorina did not appear in the 9pm hour because, boy, she unleashed a can. If you know what I'm saying earlier.

Chris Wallace 1:20:49 
Well, you know, that's the exciting thing, because, you know, there's been a lot of questions, should it be divided? Should it not be divided? And yes, there were two tiers. There were the seven lowest in the polls. Now we have the top 10 in the polls, but you know, it's a fluid process, and it was certainly true four years ago. Some that were in the lower tier are going to jump up, and perhaps some that are here tonight are going to slip down a little bit. But there's a long time between now and the snowy caucuses in February in Iowa.

Brett Baer 1:21:17 
We should point out our next debate is right before the Iowa caucuses, and it's going to be quite something.

Megyn Kelly 1:21:23 
This is, I think, going to be very meaningful. It would have been tough to have 17 candidates up here, as great as it would have been to try to find a way to do it, but it's would have been like herding

Brett Baer 1:21:32 
cats photos. I think that's it.

Megyn Kelly 1:21:35 
All right, guys. All right. So the audience knows we're going to restart at the top of the hour, because that is when the nation believes that this debate starts not at 850 so we'll get it going at nine o'clock, and we'll have a clean start to the show, and we'll take it from there.

Brett Baer 1:21:48 
This audience has been great. We're going to talk about, you know, the excitement and how we're going to make this all come together. You

Megyn Kelly 1:22:10 
it is 9pm on the East Coast, and the moment of truth has arrived. Welcome to the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign. Live from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio

Steve 1:22:21 
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: expanded Medicaid three or four times. Secondly, I had an opportunity to bring resources back to Ohio to do what to treat the mentally ill. 10,000 of them sit in our prisons. It costs $22,500 a year to keep them in prison. I'd rather get them their medication so they could lead a decent life. Secondly, we are rehabbing the drug addicted. 80% of the people in our prisons have addictions problems. We now treat them in the prisons, release them in the community, and the recidivism rate is 10% and everybody across this country knows that the tsunami of drugs is is threatening their very families, so we're treating them and getting them on their feet. And finally, the working poor, instead of them having come into the emergency rooms, where it costs more, where they're sicker and we end up paying, we brought a program in here to make sure that people could get on their feet. And you know what? Everybody has a right to their God given purpose. And finally, our Medicaid is growing at one of the lowest rates in the country. And finally, we went from 8 billion in the hole to 2 billion in the black. We've cut 5 billion in taxes, and we've grown 350,000 jobs.]

Chris Wallace 1:23:33 
Gentlemen, we're turning to a new subject that all of you have been talking about and some of you have been disagreeing about, and that is the issue of immigration. Governor Bush, you released a new plan this week on illegal immigration, focusing on enforcement, which some suggest is your effort to show that you're not soft on that issue. I want to ask you about a statement that you made last year about illegal immigrants, and here's what you said, they broke the law, but it's not a felony. It's an act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family. Do you stand by that statement, and do you stand by your support for earned legal status?

Speaker 3 1:24:16 
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: I do. I believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option they want to provide for their family, but we need to control our border. It's not it's our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in. So I've written a book about this, and yet, this week, I did come up with a comprehensive strategy that really mirrored what we said in the book, which is that we need to deal with E verify. We need to deal with people that come with a legal visa and overstay. We need to be much more strategic on how we deal with border enforcement, border security. We need to eliminate the sanctuary cities in this country. It is ridiculous and tragic that people are dying because of the fact that that local governments are not following the federal law. There's. Much to do.] And I think, rather than talking about this as a wedge issue, which Barack Obama's done now for six long years, the next president, and I hope to be that President, will fix this once and for all, so that we can turn this into a driver for high, sustained economic growth. And there should be a path to earn legal status for those that are here, not amnesty, earn legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time. Thank you, sir, Mr.

Chris Wallace 1:25:28 
Trump, it has not escaped. Anybody has noticed that you say that the Mexican government, the Mexican government, is sending criminals, rapists, drug dealers across the border. Governor Bush has called those remarks, quote, extraordinarily ugly. I'd like you you're right next to him. Tell us, talk to him directly, and say how you respond to that and and you have repeatedly said that you have evidence that the Mexican government is doing this, but that you have evidence you have refused or declined to share. Why not use this first Republican presidential debate to share your proof with the American people?

John Kasich 1:26:09 
[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: So if it weren't for me, you wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration, Chris, you wouldn't even be talking about this was not a subject that was on anybody's mind until I brought it up at my announcement, and I said, Mexico is sending except the reporters, because they're a very dishonest lot, generally speaking, in the world of politics, they didn't cover my statement the way I said it.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: The fact is, since then, many killings, murders, crime, drugs pouring across the border, our money going out, and the drugs coming in. And I said, we need to build a wall, and it has to be built quickly. And I don't mind having a big, beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally. But we need Jeb to build a wall. We need to keep illegals out.] Mr.

Chris Wallace 1:27:11 
Trump, I'll give you 30 seconds. I'll give you 30 seconds to answer my question, which was, what evidence do you have specific evidence that the Mexican government is sending rentals across the border. 30 seconds

John Kasich 1:27:26 
Border Patrol. I was at the border last week, border patrol. People that I deal with, that I talk to, they say this is what's happening. [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Because our leaders are stupid, our politicians are stupid, and the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning, and they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them. They don't want to take care of them. Why should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them,] and that's what's happening, whether you like it or not.

Chris Wallace 1:28:00 
All right, obviously, there's a lot more to talk about this. We're going to have more questions for the candidates on illegal immigration, plus other key topics, including your questions on Facebook.

Welcome back to Fox News Facebook, Republican debate night. We're going to continue the questions now on illegal immigration. We kind of ended with a cliffhanger there. So let's continue the conversation. Governor Kasich, I know you don't like to talk about Donald Trump, but I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said. When you say that the American government is stupid, that the Mexican government is sending criminals, that we're being bamboozled. Is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration?

Steve 1:28:52 
Chris, first of all, I was just saying to Chris, Christie, they say we're outspoken. We need to take lessons from Donald Trump if we're gonna, if we're really gonna learn it. Here's the thing about Donald Trump. Donald Trump's hitting a nerve in this country. He is. He's hitting a nerve. People are frustrated. They're fed up. They don't think the government is working for him, and for people that want to just tune them out, they're making a mistake. Now he's got his solutions. Some of us have other solutions. You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington. Hadn't been done since I was a military reformer. I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole in a 350,000 job loss to a $2 billion surplus and a gain of 350,000

Chris Wallace 1:29:39 
jobs. Respectfully. Can we talk about illegal but

Steve 1:29:41 
the point is, is that we all have solutions. Mr. Trump is touching a nerve because people want the wall to be built. They want to see an end to illegal immigration. They want to see and we all do, but we all have different ways of getting there, and you're going to hear from all of us tonight about what our ideas are,

Chris Wallace 1:29:58 
all right. Well, Senator Rubio. Let me see if I can do better with you. Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid, their leaders are smart, and all of these illegals coming over are criminals?

Megyn Kelly 1:30:09 
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Well, let me set the record straight on a couple of things. The first is the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. They're coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, those countries are the are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority.] I also believe we need a fence. The problem is, if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too, and that's why you need an E verify system, and you need an entry exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with the Governor Kasich. Governor Kasich just said, people are frustrated. [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration, there are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we're being taken advantage of. We feel like despite our generosity, we are being taken advantage of.] And let me tell you, who never gets talked about in these debates, the people that call my office who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States, and they paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can't get in, and they're wondering, maybe they should come illegally. And so these are important issues, and we should address it. It's a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and otherwise we're going to keep talking about this for the next 30 years, like we have for the last 30

Chris Wallace 1:31:16 
years. Governor Walker. Governor Walker, from 2002 till as recently as 2013 just two years ago, you supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship. Now you say that was a quick reaction to something you hadn't really thought about, and that you've changed your mind other than politics. Could you explain why in the last two years, you've changed your position on a path to citizenship, and are there other past positions that we shouldn't hold you to?

Yeah, well, Chris, I actually said it on your show earlier this year. I guess I don't said I acknowledge that. I said I actually listened to the American people, and I think people across America want a leader who's actually going to listen to them. I talked to border state governors and other elected officials. I looked at how this president, particularly through last November, messed up the immigration system this country. Most importantly, I listen to the people of America. I believe we need to secure the border. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I've been to the border with Governor Abbott and Texas and others, seeing the problems that they have there. There's international criminal organizations penetrating our southern based borders, and we need to do something about it, secure the border, enforce the law, no amnesty, and go forward the legal immigration system that gives priority to American working families and wages.]

Megyn Kelly 1:32:36 
Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don't use a politician's filter. However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women, [PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals. Your Twitter account only.]

John Kasich 1:32:57 
Rosie O'Donnell, no, it wasn't

Speaker 5 1:33:02 
you. Wasn't your Twitter account.

Megyn Kelly 1:33:12 
[PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: Thank you for the record. It was well beyond rose. Yes, I'm sure your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women's looks. You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees.] [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president?] And how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who is likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?

John Kasich 1:33:39 
[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct. I've been, I've been challenged by so many people, and I don't, frankly, have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn't have time either.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: This country is in big trouble. We don't win anymore. We lose to China, we lose to Mexico, both in trade and at the border. We lose to everybody.] And frankly, what I say, and oftentimes it's fun, it's kidding. We have a good time. What I say is what I say. And honestly, Megan, if you don't like it, I'm sorry I've been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be based on the way you have treated me, but I wouldn't do that. But you know what? We We need strength, we need energy, we need quickness, and we need brain in this country to turn it around that I can tell you right now.

Chris Wallace 1:34:47 
Senator Cruz, your colleague, Senator Paul right there next to you, said a few months ago, he agrees with you on a number of issues, but he says you do nothing to grow the party. He says you feed the. Red meat to the base, but you don't reach out to minorities. You have a toxic relationship with GOP leaders in Congress. You even called the Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell a liar recently. How can you win in 2016 when you're such a divisive figure?

Shannon Bream 1:35:21 
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Chris, I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: If you're looking for someone to go to Washington, to go along, to get along, to get to agree with the career politicians in both parties, who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests, then I ain't your guy.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: There is a reason that we have $18 trillion in debt, because as conservatives, as Republicans, we keep winning elections. We got a Republican House, we got a Republican Senate, and we don't have leaders who honor their commitments.] I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would

Brett Baer 1:36:14 
Governor Christie,

you're not exactly the darling of conservatives. You tout your record as a Republican governor in a blue state on Facebook, the most people talking about you, not surprisingly, come from your state of New Jersey, and one of the top issues they are talking about is the economy this. This may be why, under your watch, New Jersey has undergone nine credit rating downgrades. The state's 44th in private sector growth. You face an employee pension crisis, and the Garden State has the third highest foreclosure rate in the country. So why should voters believe that your management of the country's finances would be any different if

Chris Christie 1:36:57 
you think it's bad now you should have seen it when I got there. Fact is, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: fact is, in the eight years before I became governor, taxes and fees were raised at the state level 115 times. In the eight years before I became governor, spending was increased 56% and in the eight years before I became governor, there was zero net private sector job growth in New Jersey zero for eight years. So what did we do? We came in we balanced an $11 billion deficit on a $29 billion budget by cutting over 800 programs in the state budget. We brought the budget into balance with no tax increases. In fact, we vetoed five income tax increases during my time as governor. We cut business taxes $2.3 billion and we cut regulation by 1/3 of what my predecessor put in place. And what's happened since 192,000 new private sector jobs in the five and a half years I've been governor. We have a lot of work to do in New Jersey, but I am darn proud of how we brought our state back.] Governor.

Megyn Kelly 1:38:02 
Governor Walker, you have consistently said that you want to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. You recently signed an abortion law Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother's life, but you are on record as having objected to it. Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion, and with 83% of the American public in favor of a life, exception, are you two out of the mainstream on this issue to win the general election?

Chris Wallace 1:38:30 
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Well, I'm I'm pro life. I've always been pro life, and I've got a position I think is consistent with many Americans out there in that, in that I believe that that is an unborn child that's in need of protection out there,] and I've said many a time that that unborn child can be protected, and there are many other alternatives that will also protect the life of that mother that's been consistently proven [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: unlike Hillary Clinton, who has a radical position in terms of support for Planned Parenthood, I defunded Planned Parenthood more than four years ago, long before any of these videos came out, I've Got a position that's in line with everyday America,]

Governor Huckabee, like Governor Walker, you have staked out strong positions on social issues. You favor a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriages. You favor a constitutional amendment banning abortions, except for the life of the mother. Millions of people in this country agree with you, but according to the polls, and again, this is an electability question. According to the polls, more people don't. So how do you persuade enough Independents and Democrats to get elected in 2016

Brit Hume 1:39:36 
Chris, I disagree with the idea that the real issue is a constitutional amendment. That's a long and difficult process. I've actually taken a position that's bolder than that. A lot of people are talking about defunding Planned Parenthood, as if that's a huge game changer. I think it's time to do something even more bold. [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: I think the next president ought to invoke the fifth and 14th Amendments. Of the Constitution now that we clearly know that that baby inside the mother's womb is a person at the moment of conception, the reason we know that it is is because of the DNA schedule that we now have clear scientific evidence on,] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: and this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child's fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law. It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being, and we change the policy to be pro life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like their parts to a Buick the it.] [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being, and we change the policy to be pro life and protect children instead of rip up their body parts and sell them like their parts to a Buick the it.]

Brett Baer 1:40:43 
Senator Paul you recently blamed the rise of ISIS on Republican Hawks. You later said that that statement, you could have said it better, but the statement went on and you said, quote, everything they have talked about in foreign policy, they have been wrong for the last 20 years. Why are you so quick to blame your own party?

Speaker 2 1:41:07 
First of all, only ISIS is responsible for the terrorism, only ISIS is responsible for the depravity, but we do have to examine, how are we going to defeat ISIS? I've got a proposal. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I'm the leading voice in America for not arming the allies of ISIS. I've been fighting amidst a lot of opposition from both Hillary Clinton as well as some Republicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS. ISIS rides around in a billion dollars worth of US. Humvees, it's a disgrace. We ought to stop it. We shouldn't fund our enemies for goodness sakes.] So we didn't create ices. Ice crews created themselves, but we will stop them, and one of the ways we stop them is by not funding them and by not arming them.

Megyn Kelly 1:42:01 
Governor Kasich, you chose to expand Medicaid in your state. Unlike several other governors on this stage tonight, and it is already over budget, by some estimates, costing taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion in just the first 18 months. You defended your Medicaid expansion by invoking God, saying To skeptics that when they arrive in heaven, St Peter isn't going to ask them how small they've kept government, but what they have done for the poor. Why should Republican voters, who generally want to shrink government believe that you won't use your st Peter rationale to expand every government program?

Steve 1:42:37 
Well, first of all, first of all, Megan, you should know that President Reagan.

Megyn Kelly 1:42:41 
I'm Megyn Kelly, along

with my co moderators, Brett Baer and Chris Wallace, tonight, nice tonight, 1000s of people here in the queue, along with millions of voters at home, will get their very first chance to see the candidates face off in a debate answering the questions you want answered

Brett Baer 1:43:05 
< less than a year from now, in this very arena, one of these 10 candidates, or one of the seven on the previous debate tonight, will accept the Republican Party's nomination. Tonight's candidates were selected based on an average of five national polls. Just a few hours ago, you heard from the candidates ranked 11 through 17, and now the prime time event the top 10.

Chris Wallace 1:43:31 
Also of note, Fox News is Partnering For tonight's debate with Facebook. For the past several weeks, we've been asking you for questions for the candidates on Facebook, nearly 6 million of you, 6 million viewed the debate videos on our site, and more than 40,000 of you submitted questions, some of which you will hear us asking the candidates tonight.

Megyn Kelly 1:43:55 
As for the candidates who will be answering those questions here, they are positioned on the stage by how they stand in the polls in the center of the stage tonight, businessman Donald Trump, Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor

Scott Walker, the former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee,

Brett Baer 1:44:27 
neurosurgeon Dr Ben Carson, Texas Senator Ted Cruz,

John Kasich 1:44:36 
Florida Senator Marco Rubio, good,

Chris Wallace 1:44:42 
Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, New Jersey, Governor Chris Christie and your very own governor of Ohio, John Kasich.

I think you would call that a home field

Brett Baer 1:45:17 
advantage. It might be, it might be, we'll see some objections it might be. The rules for tonight are simple, one minute for answers, 30 seconds for follow ups, and if a candidate runs over, you'll hear this pleasant, no. We also have a big crowd here with us tonight in the home of the Cavaliers, as I mentioned. And while we expect them, we expect them to be enthusiastic, as you heard. We don't want to take anything away from the valuable time for the candidates. So we're looking for somewhere between a reaction to a LeBron James dunk and the Cleveland Public Library across the street somewhere. There we'll find a balance tonight. Without further ado, let's begin, gentlemen, we know how much you love hand raising questions, so we promise this is the only one tonight, the only one. Is there anyone on stage, and can I see hands who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican Party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person. Again, we're looking for you to raise your hand now. Raise your hand now if you won't make that pledge tonight, Mr. Trump. So Mr. Trump, to be clear, you're standing on a Republican primary. I fully understand the place where the RNC will give the nominee the nod. I fully understand and that experts say an independent run would almost certainly hand the race over to Democrats and likely another Clinton. You can't say tonight that you can make that

John Kasich 1:47:00 
pledge. I cannot say I have to respect the person that, if it's not me, the person that wins. If I do win, and I'm leading by quite a bit, that's what I want to do. I can totally make that pledge. If I'm the nominee, I will pledge. I will not run as an independent but, and I am discussing it with everybody, but I'm, you know, talking about a lot of leverage. We want to win, and we will win, but I want to win as the Republican. I want to run as the Republican nominee.

Brett Baer 1:47:29 
So tonight, you can't say if another one of these what's

Speaker 2 1:47:31 
wrong? [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: What's wrong? He buys and sells politicians of all stripes. He's already, he's already hedging his bet on the Clintons. Okay, so if he doesn't run as a Republican, maybe he supports Clinton, or maybe he runs as an independent, okay, but I'd say that he's already hedging his bets because he's used to buying politicians.] Well, I've

Brett Baer 1:47:53 
given him plenty of money, just to be clear, you can't make it. We're gonna we're going to move on. You're not going to make the pledge

John Kasich 1:47:59 
tonight. I will not make the pledge at this time.

Speaker 1 1:48:11 
Gentlemen, our

Megyn Kelly 1:48:13 
first round of questions is on the subject of electability in the general election, and we start tonight with you, Dr Carson. You are a successful neurosurgeon, but you admit that you have had to study up when it comes to foreign policy, saying there's a lot to learn. Your critics say that your inexperience shows you suggested that the Baltic states are not a part of NATO. Just months ago, you were unfamiliar with the major political parties and government in Israel and domestically, you thought Alan Greenspan had been Treasury Secretary instead of Federal Reserve Chair. Aren't these basic mistakes, and don't they raise legitimate questions about whether you are ready to be President.

Dr. Ben Carson 1:48:53 
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Well, I could take issue with with all of those things, but we don't have time. But I will say we have a debate here tonight, and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas, and I'm looking very much forward to demonstrating that.] In fact, the thing that is probably most important is having a brain and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly. So, you know, experience comes from a large number of different arenas, and America became a great nation early on, not because it was flooded with politicians, but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility, hard work, creativity, innovation, And that's what will get us on the right track now as well.

Chris Wallace 1:49:46 
Senator Rubio, when Jeb Bush announced his candidacy for presidency, he said this, there's no passing off responsibility when you're a governor, no blending into the legislative crowd. Could you. Please address Governor Bush across the stage here and explain to him why you, someone who has never held executive office, are better prepared to be president than he is a man who you say did a great job running your state of Florida for eight years. Well, thank

Megyn Kelly 1:50:14 
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: you for the question, Chris, and it's great to be here tonight.] Let me begin by saying this. I'm not new to the political process. I was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before I even got into the Senate. I would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition. It's important to be qualified. But if this election is a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton is going to be the next president because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight, here's what this election better be about. This election better be about the future, not the past. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced. This country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed. You know, the largest retailer in the country, in the world today, Amazon, doesn't even own a single store, and these changes have been disruptive. They have changed people's lives, the jobs that once sustained our middle class, they either don't pay enough, or they are gone, and we need someone that understands that as our nominee.] If I'm our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton going to lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck? How is she how is she going to lecture me? How is she going to lecture me about student loans I owed over $100,000 just four years ago. If I'm our nominee, we will be the party of the future. Governor Bush,

Brett Baer 1:51:31 
you have insisted that your own, your own man, you say you have a life experience uniquely your own, not your father's, not your brother's. But there are several opponents on this stage who get big applause lines in early voting states with this line, quote, the last thing the country needs is another bush in the Oval Office. So do you understand the real concern in this country about dynastic politics?

Speaker 3 1:51:58 
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Absolutely I do, and I'm going to run hard, run with heart and run to win, I'm going to have to earn this. Maybe the barrier, the bar is even higher for me. That's fine. I've got a record in Florida.] I'm proud of my dad and I'm certainly proud of my brother. In Florida, they call me Jeb because I earned it. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I cut taxes every year, totaling $19 billion we were we had, we balanced every budget, we went from $1 billion of reserves to $9 billion of reserves. We were one of two states that went to AAA bond rating. They keep they called me veto Corleone because I vetoed 2500 separate line items in the budget. I'm my own man. I governed as a conservative, and I governed effectively, and the net effect was during my eight years, 1.3 million jobs were created. We left the state better off because I applied conservative principles in a purple state the right way, and people rose up.]
