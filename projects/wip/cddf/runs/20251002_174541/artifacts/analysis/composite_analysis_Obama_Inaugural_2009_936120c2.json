[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I thank President Bush for his service to our Nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.] Forty-four Americans have now taken the Presidential oath. [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet every so often, the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms.] At these moments, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents].\\nSo it has been; so it must be with this generation of Americans.\\nThat [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood]. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our Nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred]. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our economy is badly weakened], a consequence of [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: greed and irresponsibility on the part of some], but also [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the Nation for a new age]. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Homes have been lost, jobs shed, businesses\\n\\n\fshuttered. Our health care is too costly. Our schools fail too many. And each\\nday brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our\\nadversaries and threaten our planet.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: These are the indicators of crisis], subject to data and statistics. Less\\nmeasurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our\\nland, a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, that the next\\ngeneration must lower its sights. Today [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: I say to you that the challenges we\\nface are real. They are serious, and they are many. They will not be met\\neasily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: They will be met.]\\nOn this day, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of\\npurpose over conflict and discord]. On this day, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: we come to proclaim an end\\nto the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out\\ndogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics].\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come\\nto set aside childish things]. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: The time has come to reaffirm our enduring\\nspirit, to choose our better history, to carry forward that precious gift, that\\nnoble idea passed on from generation to generation: the God-given\\npromise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue\\ntheir full measure of happiness.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: In reaffirming the greatness of our Nation, we understand that greatness is\\nnever a given. It must be earned]. Our journey has never been one of\\nshortcuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the fainthearted,\\nfor those who prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches\\nand fame. Rather, [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of\\nthings--some celebrated, but more often men and women obscure in their\\nlabor--who have carried us up the long, rugged path toward prosperity and\\nfreedom.]\\nFor us, [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across\\noceans in search of a new life]. For us, [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: they toiled in sweatshops and settled\\nthe West, endured the lash of the whip, and plowed the hard Earth]. For us,\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: they fought and died in places like Concord and Gettysburg, Normandy and\\nKhe Sanh].\\n\\n\f[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Time and again, these men and women struggled and sacrificed and\\nworked 'til their hands were raw so that we might live a better life]. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: They saw\\nAmerica as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions, greater than all\\nthe differences of birth or wealth or faction].\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous,\\npowerful nation on Earth]. Our workers are no less productive than when\\nthis crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive. Our goods and services\\nno less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Our\\ncapacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting\\nnarrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions, that time has surely\\npassed]. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and\\nbegin again the work of remaking America].\\nFor everywhere we look, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: there is work to be done. The state of the economy\\ncalls for action, bold and swift], and [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: we will act not only to create new jobs\\nbut to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges,\\nthe electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us\\ntogether. We will restore science to its rightful place and wield technology's\\nwonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the\\nsun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And\\nwe will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the\\ndemands of a new age. All this we can do. All this we will do.]\\nNow, [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: there are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest\\nthat our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are\\nshort, for they have forgotten what this country has already done, what free\\nmen and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common\\npurpose and necessity to courage].\\n[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath\\nthem, that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long\\nno longer apply]. The question we ask today is not whether our Government\\nis too big or too small, but [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: whether it works; whether it helps families find\\njobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified].\\nWhere the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is\\nno, programs will end. And [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: those of us who manage the public's dollars will\\nbe held to account to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business\\nin the light of day, because only then can we restore the vital trust between\\na people and their government].\\n\\nNor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill.\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched]. But [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: this\\ncrisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out\\nof control]. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The Nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the\\nprosperous]. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: The success of our economy has always depended not just on\\nthe size of our gross domestic product, but on the reach of our prosperity,\\non our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart, not out of\\ncharity, but because it is the surest route to our common good].\\nAs for [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our\\nsafety and our ideals]. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils that we can\\nscarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights\\nof man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still\\nlight the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake]. And so\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: to all the other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the\\ngrandest capitals to the small village where my father was born, know that\\nAmerica is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who\\nseeks a future of peace and dignity, and we are ready to lead once more].\\nRecall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just\\nwith missiles and tanks but with [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: sturdy alliances and enduring convictions].\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle\\nus to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its\\nprudent use. Our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the\\nforce of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We are the keepers of this legacy]. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Guided by these principles once more, we\\ncan meet those new threats that demand even greater effort, even greater\\ncooperation and understanding between nations]. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will begin to\\nresponsibly leave Iraq to its people and forge a hard-earned peace in\\nAfghanistan]. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to\\nlessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet]. [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: We\\nwill not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense]. And\\n[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and\\nslaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and\\ncannot be broken. You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you].\\nFor [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We\\nare a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and nonbelievers.\\nWe are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this\\n\\n\fEarth]. And because [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and\\nsegregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more\\nunited, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass,\\nthat the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller,\\nour common humanity shall reveal itself, and that America must play its\\nrole in ushering in a new era of peace].\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest\\nand mutual respect]. [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow\\nconflict or blame their society's ills on the West, know that your people will\\njudge you on what you can build, not what you destroy]. [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: To those who cling\\nto power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know\\nthat you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if\\nyou are willing to unclench your fist].\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make\\nyour farms flourish and let clean waters flow, to nourish starved bodies and\\nfeed hungry minds]. And [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty,\\nwe say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our\\nborders, nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to\\neffect, for the world has changed, and we must change with it].\\nAs we consider the road that unfolds before us, [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: we remember with humble\\ngratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off\\ndeserts and distant mountains]. [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: They have something to tell us today, just as\\nthe fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages]. [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: We honor\\nthem not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they\\nembody the spirit of service, a willingness to find meaning in something\\ngreater than themselves]. And yet at this moment, [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: a moment that will define\\na generation, it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all].\\nFor as much as Government can do and must do, [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: it is ultimately the faith\\nand determination of the American people upon which this Nation relies]. It\\nis the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness\\nof workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job,\\nwhich sees us through our darkest hours. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: It is the firefighter's courage to\\nstorm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture\\na child, that finally decides our fate].\\n\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them\\nmay be new]. But [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: those values upon which our success depends--honesty\\nand hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and\\npatriotism--these things are old. These things are true]. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: They have been the\\nquiet force of progress throughout our history]. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: What is demanded then is a\\nreturn to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of\\nresponsibility, a recognition on the part of every American that we have\\nduties to ourselves, our Nation, and the world. Duties that we do not\\ngrudgingly accept but, rather, seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there\\nis nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving\\nour all to a difficult task].\\nThis is the price and the promise of citizenship. This is the source of our\\nconfidence, [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain\\ndestiny]. [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed; why men and\\nwomen and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration\\nacross this magnificent Mall, and why a man whose father less than 60\\nyears ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand\\nbefore you to take a most sacred oath].\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: So let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and how far we\\nhave traveled]. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a\\nsmall band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy\\nriver. The Capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was\\nstained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our Revolution was\\nmost in doubt, [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: the Father of our Nation ordered these words be read to the\\npeople:]\\n\\\"[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Let it be told to the future world . . . that in the depth of winter, when\\nnothing but hope and virtue could survive . . . that the city and the country,\\nalarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it].]\\\"\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: America, in the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship,\\nlet us remember these timeless words]. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: With hope and virtue, let us brave\\nonce more the icy currents and endure what storms may come. Let it be\\nsaid by our children's children that when we were tested, we refused to let\\nthis journey end; that we did not turn back, nor did we falter]. And [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: with eyes\\nfixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great\\ngift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations].\\n\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America].\\n\\nBarack Obama: The American Presidency Project\\n\\nNote: The President spoke at approximately 12 p.m. at the West Front of the U.S.\\nCapitol.
