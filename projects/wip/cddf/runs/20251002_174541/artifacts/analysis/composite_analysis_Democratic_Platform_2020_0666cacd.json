We will re-open the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, even outside of the\\nnormal open enrollment season, and expand subsidies to make it easier for people to buy health\\ncoverage. Democrats will also make available on the marketplace a public option administered\\nthrough the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) which includes a platinum-level\\nchoice, with low fees and no deductibles.

For those workers who do lose their jobs, we will expand\\nthe unemployment insurance system to cover more workers, including independent contractors\\nand gig, part-time, and tipped workers; make sure platform companies and companies that\\nmisclassify employees as contractors pay in to support the system like other employers do; and\\nraise wage replacement rates, which are far too low in many states.

[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: State and local budget cuts translate quickly\\ninto lost jobs in education, health care, and social services\u2014all fields where we need to be\\nadding jobs to meet the needs of the American people.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will extend significant aid to\\nstate and local governments, school districts, and public and nonprofit colleges and universities,\\nincluding HBCUs and MSIs, to address these budget shortfalls and secure jobs.

workers,\\nincreased racial inequality, reduced competition, or constricted innovation, and assign\\nappropriate remedies.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will direct regulators to consider potential effects of future\\nmergers on the labor market, on low-income and marginalized communities, and on racial\\nequity, as well as on consumer prices and market competition.]

activities.]\\nGuaranteeing a Secure and Dignified Retirement\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats are proud to be the party that advocates retirement security for all.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We are the

multiemployer pension system that would endanger workers\u2019 and retirees\u2019 pensions,\\nincluding composite pension plans.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We support amending federal bankruptcy laws to

universal health care for a century.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We are proud to be the\\nparty of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Because of the Obama-Biden\\nAdministration and the Affordable Care Act, more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing\\nconditions, from heart disease to asthma, are secure in the knowledge that insurance companies\\ncan no longer discriminate against them. Women can no longer be charged more than men just\\nbecause of their gender. And more Americans are able to get health coverage than ever before.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats will keep up the fight until all Americans can access secure, affordable, high-quality\\nhealth insurance\u2014because as Democrats, we fundamentally believe health care is a right for all,\\nnot a privilege for the few.]\\n26\\n\\n\f[MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Unfortunately, at every turn, Democrats\u2019 efforts to guarantee health coverage have been met by\\nobstruction and opposition from the Republican Party.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: It has been Republicans who have\\nembraced junk plans that undermine protections for pre-existing conditions.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: It was Republican\\nstate attorneys general who sued to block Medicaid expansion and Republican governors who\\nrefused to extend Medicaid coverage to their citizens, leaving millions of low-income\\nAmericans, disproportionately people of color, unable to access health coverage.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: And in the\\nmidst of the worst global pandemic in generations\u2014one that has left more than 150,000\\nAmericans dead and counting\u2014the Trump Administration is fighting in court to invalidate the\\nentirety of the Affordable Care Act and eliminate insurance for tens of millions of people.]\\n[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Overturning the Affordable Care Act remains a central plank of the Republican Party platform.\\nThe difference in values between the two parties on this life-or-death issue could not be more\\nstark.]\\n[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: The COVID-19 pandemic has made this difference in values painfully, brutally clear.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: President\\nTrump has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, bullied governors for enacting\\nlife-saving public health measures, and left our frontline health care heroes without the\\nequipment they need to protect themselves and the American people.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The burdens of this\\npandemic have not been borne equally, as communities of color have suffered higher rates of\\ninfection and death, and struggled to access life-saving care when they need it most.] [PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: Our\\nessential workers have been deemed expendable by the President and his Administration.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: As Democrats, we say with one voice: no more.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We are going to at last build the health care system the American people have always deserved:\\none that finally provides universal health care coverage; reduces prescription drug prices,\\npremiums, and out-of-pocket costs; reins in overall health care expenses; and tackles the\\ndeep-seated inequities in our health care system.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will build a health care system that is driven\\nby the needs of patients and the people who care for them, instead of the profit motives of\\ncorporations.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will tackle entrenched racial disparities in health

ensuring that health care is a\\nhuman right.]\\n27\\n\\n\fSecuring Universal Health Care Through a Public Option\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats believe we need to protect, strengthen, and build upon our bedrock health care\\nprograms, including the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Veterans Affairs\\n(VA) system.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Private insurers need real competition to ensure they have incentive to provide\\naffordable, quality coverage to every American.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: To achieve that objective, we will give all Americans the choice to select a high-quality,\\naffordable public option through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: The public option will\\nprovide at least one plan choice without deductibles; will be administered by CMS, not private\\ncompanies; and will cover all primary care without any co-payments and control costs for other\\ntreatments by negotiating prices with doctors and hospitals, just like Medicare does on behalf of\\nolder people.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Everyone will be eligible to choose the public option or another Affordable Care Act\\nmarketplace plan.]

having to wait until they are 65.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats are categorically opposed to raising the\\nMedicare retirement age.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will also empower the states, as laboratories of democracy, to use Affordable Care\\nAct innovation waivers to develop locally tailored approaches to health coverage, including by\\nremoving barriers to states that seek to experiment with statewide universal health care\\napproaches.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We also know that finally covering every American through the public and private insurance\\nsystem alone is not enough to guarantee universal access.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: That why Democrats support\\ndoubling investments in community health centers and rural health clinics in underserved urban\\nand rural areas, including increased support for dental care, mental health care, and substance use\\nservices like medication-assisted treatment, and why we will increase support for mobile health\\nclinics.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will enact longer, multi-year funding cycles for these critical health services so they\\ncan operate with greater certainty, as community health centers are the nation\u2019s only providers\\nthat are required by law to be both located in medically underserved areas and required to serve\\nall who seek care, regardless of their ability to pay.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will leverage innovative payment\\noptions through Medicare and Medicaid to help community health centers and rural health\\nclinics keep their doors open.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will expand the National Health Service Corps and Teaching\\nHealth Center Graduate Medical Education Program to grow a diverse primary care workforce\\n28\\n\\n\fand to

Prices and Taking on the Pharmaceutical Industry\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Too many Americans struggle to afford the prescription drugs they need to get or stay healthy.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: No American should find themselves foregoing or rationing medications because they can\u2019t\\nafford to pay\u2014especially when taxpayer money underwrites research leading to the development\\nof many prescription drugs in the first place.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will take aggressive action to ensure that Americans do not pay more for prescription\\ndrugs than people in other advanced economies, and ensure that all necessary medications are\\ncovered.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will empower Medicare to at last be able to negotiate prescription drug prices for all\\npublic and private purchasers\u2014for families and businesses, as well as older Americans\u2014no\\nmatter where they get their coverage.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will also prevent the price of brand-name and outlier\\ngeneric drugs from rising faster than the inflation rate.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will cap out-of-pocket drug costs for\\nseniors, and ensure that effective treatments for chronic health

subsidies.\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats believe that when Americans are in the hospital or an emergency room, they\\nshouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether their health care providers are in-network or not, which is\\nwhy we will outlaw the predatory practice of surprise medical billing.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will work to increase\\nprice transparency in the health care system across all payers, and reduce paperwork through\\nuniform medical billing.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will vigorously use antitrust laws to fight against mega-mergers\\nin the hospital, insurance, and pharmaceutical industries that would raise prices for patients by\\nundermining market competition.]\\n\\n29\\n\\n\f[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Excessive prescription drug cost-sharing and voids in coverage such as dental, vision, and\\nhearing services can lead to severe health consequences for Medicare patients.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats will\\nfight any efforts to cut Medicare benefits, and support finding financially sustainable policies to\\nexpand Medicare to cover dental, vision, and hearing.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will support policies that increase the

approved\\ntreatments for other substance use disorders.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We believe we must stop over-prescribing while\\nimproving access to effective and needed pain management.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats recognize that\\nincarcerated people suffer from serious mental health and substance use disorders at higher rates\\nthan the general population, which is why we will support expanded access to mental health and\\nsubstance use disorder care in prisons and for returning citizens.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will ensure no one is\\nincarcerated solely for drug use, and support increased use of drug courts, harm reduction\\ninterventions, and treatment diversion programs for those struggling with substance use\\ndisorders.]\\nExpanding Long-Term Care Services and

L.C. d\u200b ecision,\\nwhich found institutional segregation of people with disabilities to be unlawful.\\nEliminate Racial, Gender, and Geographic Health Inequities\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The national statistics on American health care mask profound disparities in insurance rates,\\naccess to primary and specialized care, and disparate health outcomes, which are a symptom of\\nthose disparities in access.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the uninsured rate was nearly\\nthree times higher for Latinos and nearly twice as high for Black Americans as it was for whites.\\nSome segments of the Asian American and Pacific Islander population faced uninsured rates\\nrivaling those of Black Americans and Latinos, and more than one in five Native Americans and\\nAlaska Natives was uninsured. Black children are far more likely than white children to suffer\\nfrom asthma. Latinos, Native Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and Black\\nAmericans are diagnosed with diabetes at higher rates than whites. And average life expectancy\\nis more than two years lower for rural Americans compared to those who live in metropolitan\\nareas.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We recognize it is not enough to have a
