He was a local leader. He was like the unofficial mayor of his hometown of Waimanalo on the island of Oahu. He called me up one day, thank God he had my personal cell phone number, and he said, Tulsi, I just had a heart attack, and I'm at the hospital down the street. We live, like 20 minutes from each other. I'm at the hospital down the street. They tell me, if they don't. If they can't have open heart surgery right now that I may not survive the VA hospital, which was about 40 minutes drive over the mountains to the other side of the island, said they would not cover this surgery that would save his life, that he had to get into an ambulance and take that 40 minute drive to get to the VA his doctor said you might not make it, Andrew, you might not survive.

I know we're in Pennsylvania, and, you know, I signed up for a student health plan, and it was a lot of money, right? And I didn't have anybody helping me out. I was on Pell grants. And, you know, things were pretty tight because I was, you know, not. I didn't come from a family of means. I didn't come from a family of money. And I had no idea that, because of a law that had been passed while I was in the Marine Corps, that I could get free health care through the VA, I think it was for five years after I got out of the United States Marine Corps, and I had no idea. And so I spent hundreds of dollars on health insurance premiums, until somebody kind of just said, Hey, why don't you go to the VA and get health care service?
