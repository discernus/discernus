BIDEN, JR.\\nInaugural Address\\nJanuary 20, 2021\\n\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader\\nSchumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, and my distinguished\\nguests, and my fellow Americans]: [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: This is America's day. This is democracy's\\nday, a day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Through a crucible\\nfor the ages America has been tested anew], and [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: America has risen to the\\nchallenge.]\\nToday we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the\\ncause of democracy. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: The people\u2014the will of the people has been heard,\\nand the will of the people has been heeded.] We've learned again that\\ndemocracy is precious, democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends,\\ndemocracy has prevailed.\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: So now, on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought\\nto shake the Capitol's very foundation, we come together as one Nation\\nunder God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we\\nhave for more than two centuries.] As we look ahead in our uniquely\\nAmerican way\u2014restless, bold, optimistic\u2014and [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: set our sights on the Nation\\nwe know we can be and we must be], [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I thank my predecessors of both\\nparties for their presence here today. I thank them from the bottom of my]\\n\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: heart. And I know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength, the\\nstrength of our Nation, as does President Carter, who I spoke with last\\nnight, who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of\\nservice.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots have taken, the oath\\nfirst sworn by George Washington.] But [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: the American story depends not on\\nany one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us, on \\\"We the People,\\\" who\\nseek a more perfect Union.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: This is a great Nation; we are good people.] Over the centuries, through\\nstorm and strife, in peace and in war, we've come so far. But [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we still have\\nfar to go.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We'll press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to\\ndo in this winter of peril and significant possibilities: much to repair, much\\nto restore, much to heal, much to build, and much to gain.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Few people in our Nation's history have been more challenged or found a\\ntime more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: A once-in-a-century virus that silently stalks the country has taken as many lives in one\\nyear as America lost in all of World War II. Millions of jobs have been lost;\\nhundreds of thousands of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice some\\n400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be\\ndeferred no longer. A cry for survival comes from the planet itself, a cry that\\ncan't be any more desperate or any more clear. And now, a rise of political\\nextremism, White supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront\\nand we will defeat.]\\nTo overcome these challenges\u2014to restore the soul and secure the future of\\nAmerica\u2014requires so much more than words. It requires the most elusive\\nof all things in a democracy: [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: unity. Unity.]\\nIn another January on New Year's Day in 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the\\nEmancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper, the President said,\\nand I quote, \\\"If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act,\\nand my whole soul is in it.\\\" My whole soul is in it.\\nToday, on this January day, my whole soul is in this: [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: bringing America\\ntogether, uniting our people, uniting our Nation.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And I ask every American\\nto join me in this cause: uniting to fight the foes we face: anger, resentment,\\n\\nand hatred; extremism, lawlessness, violence; disease, joblessness, and\\nhopelessness.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: With unity we can do great things, important things. We can right wrongs.\\nWe can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe\\nschools. We can overcome the deadly virus. We can reward work and\\nrebuild the middle class and make health care secure for all. We can deliver\\nracial justice, and we can make America, once again, the leading force for\\ngood in the world.]\\nI know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these\\ndays. [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real.] But I also\\nknow they are not new. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our history has been a constant struggle between\\nthe American ideal that we all are created equal and the harsh, ugly reality\\nthat racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart. The battle\\nis perennial. And victory is never assured.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Through the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through\\nstruggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our \\\"better angels\\\" have always prevailed.\\nIn each of these moments, enough of us\u2014enough of us\u2014have come\\ntogether to carry all of us forward. And we can do that now. History, faith,\\nand reason show the way: the way of unity.]\\n[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: We can see each other not as adversaries, but as neighbors.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We can treat\\neach other with dignity and respect.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We can join forces, stop the shouting,\\nand lower the temperature.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: For without unity, there is no peace, only\\nbitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a\\nstate of chaos.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge], and [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: unity is the path\\nforward.] And [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: we must meet this moment as the United States of America. If\\nwe do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail. We have never, ever, ever, ever\\nfailed in America when we have acted together.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And so today, at this time, in this place, let's start afresh, all of us. Let's\\nbegin to listen to one another, hear one another, see one another, show\\nrespect to one another.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying\\neverything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for\\ntotal war.] And [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are\\nmanipulated and even manufactured.]\\n\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. America has to be\\nbetter than this. And I believe America is so much better than this.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Just look around. Here we stand, in the shadow of the Capitol dome, as was\\nmentioned earlier, completed amid the Civil War, when the Union itself was\\nliterally hanging in the balance. Yet we endured, we prevailed.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Here we stand looking out on the great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his\\ndream.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Here we stand, where 108 years ago, at another Inaugural, thousands of\\nprotesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote. And\\ntoday we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in American history\\nelected to national office: Vice President Kamala Harris. Don't tell me things\\ncan't change.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington Cemetery, where heroes\\nwho gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: And here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use\\nviolence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our\\ndemocracy, to drive us from this sacred ground.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: It did not happen. It will\\nnever happen, not today, not tomorrow, not ever\u2014not ever.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: To all those who supported our campaign, I am humbled by the faith you've\\nplaced in us.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me\\nout as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. And if you\\nstill disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: The right to dissent\\npeaceably, within the guardrails of our Republic, is perhaps this Nation's\\ngreatest strength. Yet hear me clearly: Disagreement must not lead to\\ndisunion.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: And I pledge this to you: I will be a President for all Americans\u2014all\\nAmericans. And I promise you, I will fight as hard for those who did not\\nsupport me as for those who did.]\\nMany centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a\\npeople was a multitude defined by [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: the common objects of their love\u2014\\ndefined by the common objects of their love. What are the common objects\\nwe as Americans love? That define us as Americans? I think we know:\\nopportunity, security, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, and yes, the truth.]\\n\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: There is truth,\\nand there are lies: lies told for power and for profit.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: And each of us has a\\nduty and a responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as\\nleaders\u2014leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect\\nour Nation\u2014to defend the truth and defeat the lies.]\\n[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: Look, I understand that many of my fellow Americans view the future with\\nfear and trepidation. I understand they worry about their jobs. I\\nunderstand, like my dad, they lay at bed at night staring at the ceiling,\\nwondering: \\\"Can I keep my health care? Can I pay my mortgage?\\\" Thinking\\nabout their families, about what comes next. I promise you, I get it.] But\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting\\nthose who don't look like you or worship the way you do or don't get their\\nnews from the same sources you do. We must end this uncivil war that pits\\nred against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do\\nthis if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a little\\ntolerance and humility, and if we're willing to stand in the other person's\\nshoes, as my mom would say, just for a moment. Stand in their shoes.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Because here is the thing about life: There is no accounting for what fate\\nwill deal you. Some days when you need a hand. There are other days when\\nwe're called to lend a hand. That's how it has to be. That is what we do for\\none another. And if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more\\nprosperous, more ready for the future. And we can still disagree.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we're going to need each\\nother. We need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We're entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus.\\nWe must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one Nation. One\\nNation.] And I promise you this: As the Bible says, \\\"Weeping may endure for\\na night, but joy cometh in the morning.\\\" [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We will get through this, together\u2014\\ntogether.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Look, folks, all my colleagues that I served with in the House and the Senate\\nup here. We all understand the world is watching, watching all of us today.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: So here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been\\ntested, and we have come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances\\nand engage with the world once again, not to meet yesterday's challenges,\\n\\nbut today's and tomorrow's challenges. And we'll lead not merely by the\\nexample of our power, but by the power of our example. We will be a\\nstrong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Look, you all know, we have been through so much in this Nation. And, in\\nmy first act as President, I'd like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent\\nprayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic, those\\n400,000 fellow Americans: moms, dads, husbands, wives, sons, daughters,\\nfriends, neighbors, and coworkers. We will honor them by becoming the\\npeople and Nation we know we can and should be.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: So I ask you, let's say a silent prayer for those who have lost their lives, for\\nthose they left behind, and for our country.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: [At this point, a moment of silence was observed.]]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Amen.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Folks, this is a time of testing. We face an attack on our democracy and on\\ntruth, a raging virus, growing inequity, the sting of systemic racism, a\\nclimate in crisis, America's role in the world. Any one of these would be\\nenough to challenge us in profound ways. But the fact is, we face them all at\\nonce, presenting this Nation with one of the gravest of responsibilities\\nwe've had.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Now we're going to be tested. Are we going to step up? All of us? It is time\\nfor boldness, for there is so much to do. And this is certain, I promise you:\\nWe will be judged, you and I, by how we resolve these cascading crises of\\nour era. Will we rise to the occasion, is the question. Will we master this\\nrare and difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new\\nand better world to our children? I believe we must; I'm sure you do as well.\\nI believe we will.]\\nAnd when we do, we will write the next great chapter in the history of the\\nUnited States of America: the American story, a story that might sound\\nsomething like a song that means a lot to me. It's called \\\"American\\nAnthem,\\\" and there's one verse that stands out, at least for me, and it goes\\nlike this:\\n\\n\\\"The work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day\\nWhat shall be our legacy? What will our children say? . . .\\nLet me know in my heart when my days are through\\nAmerica, America, I gave my best to you.\\\"\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Let's add\u2014let's us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of\\nour great Nation. If we do this, then when our days are through, our\\nchildren and our children's children will say of us: \\\"They gave their best.\\nThey did their duty.
