DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

The Democratic National Committee wishes to acknowledge that we gather together to state our
values on lands that have been stewarded through many centuries by the ancestors and
descendants of Tribal Nations who have been here since time immemorial.
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: We honor the communities native to this continent, and recognize that our country was built on
Indigenous homelands.]
We pay our respects to the millions of Indigenous people throughout history who have protected
our lands, waters, and animals.
We respectfully acknowledge that we present this Platform at our 2020 Democratic National
Convention on the lands of the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians,
the Forest County Potawatomi Community, the Ho-Chunk Nation, the Lac Courte Oreilles Band
of Lake Superior Chippewa, the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, the
Menominee Nation, the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior
Chippewa, the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, the Sokaogon Chippewa Community,
and the Stockbridge-Munsee Community, Band of Mohican Indians.

PREAMBLE
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: America is an idea—one that has endured and evolved through war and depression, prevailed
over fascism and communism, and radiated hope to far distant corners of the earth.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Americans
believe that diversity is our greatest strength. That protest is among the highest forms of
patriotism. That our fates and fortunes are bound to rise and fall together. That even when we fall
short of our highest ideals, we never stop trying to build a more perfect union.]
[PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: When the American people go to the polls this fall, we will be choosing more than a candidate.
Character is on the ballot in this election. The character of our President, yes, but more than that:
the character of our democracy, our society, and our leadership in the world.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The challenges before us—the worst public health crisis in a century, the worst economic
downturn since the Great Depression, the worst period of global upheaval in a generation, the
urgent global crisis posed by climate change, the intolerable racial injustice that still stains the
fabric of our nation—will test America’s character like never before.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare deep-seated problems in our society—the fragility of our
economy and social safety net, the risks posed by growing inequality, the impacts of racial and
economic disparities on health and well-being, and the profound consequences of deepening
polarization and political paralysis.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The bill has come due on the Trump Administration’s hollowing out of our public institutions:
the sidelining of experts, the rejection of science, the underinvestment in research, and the gross
corruption and abuses of power.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: President Trump’s dereliction of duty has caused the deaths
of
tens of thousands of Americans, the loss of tens of millions of American jobs, and lasting harm
to our children’s education and future.]
[TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: And it has revealed, at tragic economic and human cost, the emptiness of the Republican Party’s
“America First” foreign policy.] [PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: Under President Trump, America stands alone. Friends and foes
alike neither admire nor fear President Trump’s leadership—they dismiss and ridicule it.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: The
Republican Party under President Trump has made America small—when we are a people called
to do the greatest things.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats will fight to repair the soul of this nation. To unite and to heal our country.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: To
turn
this crisis into a crucible, from which we will forge a stronger, brighter, and more equitable
future.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We must right the wrongs in our democracy, redress the systemic injustices that have long
plagued our society, throw open the doors of opportunity for all Americans, and reinvent our
institutions at home and our leadership abroad.] We do not simply aspire to return our country to
where we were four years ago. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We know we must be bolder and more ambitious.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We must once again stop another Republican recession from becoming a second Great
Depression.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: President Trump and the Republican Party have rigged the economy in favor of the
5

wealthiest few and the biggest corporations, and left working families and small businesses out
in the cold.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats will forge a new social and economic contract with the American
people—a contract that creates millions of new jobs and promotes shared prosperity, closes
racial gaps in income and wealth, guarantees the right to join or form a union, raises wages and
ensures equal pay for women and paid family leave for all, and safeguards a secure and dignified
retirement.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We must guarantee health care not as a privilege for some, but as a right for every single
American.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: For a century, Democrats have fought to secure universal health care.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: In the depths of
the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump and the Republican Party are trying to tear health
care away from millions of people who depend on it for survival.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats will not allow that
to happen. We will not rest until every American can access quality health care and affordable
prescription drugs.]
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: We must steel and strengthen our democracy, not distort and debase it.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats believe
there is nothing to fear from the voices and votes of the American people.] We will restore the full
power of the Voting Rights Act and stamp out voter suppression in all its forms. We will curb
the corrupting influence of money in politics and protect the integrity of our elections from all
enemies, foreign and domestic. [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: We will never accept political gridlock as our fate. We will never
tire in our fight to deliver results and create opportunity for all Americans.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: And we will end the
war on government that has politicized our institutions, denigrated public service, and left the
American people on their own instead of working to make them whole.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We must heal our nation’s deepest wounds, not fan the flames of hate.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats will root out
structural and systemic racism in our economy and our society, and reform our criminal justice
system from top to bottom, because we believe Black lives matter.] We will ensure that our nation
continues to prize diversity and compassion, and welcomes those who yearn to participate in our
great democratic experiment by creating a humane, 21st century immigration system that
benefits all Americans.
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: We will give hate no safe harbor. We will never amplify or legitimize the voices of racism,
misogyny, anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim bigotry, or white supremacy.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats will protect and
promote the equal rights of all our citizens—women, LGBTQ+ people, religious minorities,
people with disabilities, Native Americans, and all who have been discriminated against in too
many ways and for too many generations. We commit ourselves to the vision articulated by
Frederick Douglass of “a Government founded upon justice, and recognizing the equal rights of
all.”]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We must lead the world in taking on the climate crisis, not deny the science and accelerate the
damage.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: From Houston, Texas, to Mexico Beach, Florida; from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to
Davenport, Iowa, the last four years have seen record-breaking storms, devastating wildfires, and
historic floods.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats will rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement and go further, building a
thriving, equitable, and globally competitive clean energy economy that puts workers and
communities first, and leaves no one behind.]

6

[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We must provide a world-class education in every ZIP code, to every child, because education is
a critical public good.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats believe in universal early childhood education, and affordable,
high-quality child care. We will shut down the school-to-prison pipeline, and build a
school-to-opportunity pipeline in its place. We will make college affordable again, and give
Americans relief from crushing student debt.]
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: We commit to a foreign policy that accelerates our domestic renewal, not undermines it.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We will
focus on what matters most to Americans—more and better jobs, greater security, a cleaner
environment, and a more inclusive and resilient society.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will lead with diplomacy as
our tool of first resort and mobilize our allies and partners to meet the tests none of us can meet
on our own.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We will stand up to the forces of authoritarianism, not aid and abet their rise, and we
will speak and act with clarity and purpose on behalf of human rights wherever they are under
threat. And we will honor our sacred covenant with our women and men in uniform, our
veterans, and our military families who have carried the burdens of wars that must—at long
last—come to an end.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Above all, Democrats still believe in the American idea—its principles, its purpose, and its
promise.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: We know that four more years of the crass, craven, corrupt leadership we have seen
from Donald Trump and the Republican Party will damage our character and our country beyond
repair.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We pray, as Langston Hughes did, “O, let America be America again—the land that never
has been yet—and yet must be—the land where ​every​ man is free.” [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats call on all
Americans to come together and seize this last, best chance to restore the soul of our nation—and
vote this November to ensure our greatest days are still to come.]

PROTECTING AMERICANS AND RECOVERING FROM THE COVID-19
PANDEMIC
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: When we do not have competent, experienced, compassionate leaders in government, the
American people suffer. That is the case with the novel coronavirus.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: President Trump and his
Administration missed multiple opportunities to protect the American people from this deadly
pathogen.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Instead of recognizing the danger and confronting it head-on, President Trump lied to
the American people about the disease’s severity, its transmissibility, and the threat it posed to
lives and livelihoods.]
[MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Make no mistake: President Trump’s abject failure to respond forcefully and capably to the
COVID-19 pandemic—his failure to lead—makes him responsible for the deaths of tens of
thousands of Americans.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: COVID-19 has laid bare deep fault lines in our economy, our society, and our health care
system. Disparities in health care access, in access to paid sick leave, in environmental quality, in
the employment market, and in housing have contributed to disproportionate rates of infection
and death among Black Americans, Native Americans, Latinos, and certain Asian American and
Pacific Islander communities.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: President Trump’s failure to pay attention to early intelligence reports about the pandemic
wasted critical weeks in which we could have prepared for the outbreak.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Once the pandemic
began spreading in the United States, the President’s failure to lay out clear, consistent guidelines
for cities, states, businesses, and school districts to control the spread of COVID-19 created
widespread confusion and chaos.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: His reckless disregard for the advice of public health experts
has made it harder for mayors and governors to protect the American people.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Rather than surge
the production of personal protective equipment and other critical supplies where they were
needed most, the Administration held life-saving resources hostage for political obeisance.]
[MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Instead of bringing Americans together, President Trump tried to divide us, using racist and
xenophobic rhetoric that has contributed to an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans
and Pacific Islanders.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: And in the midst of the pandemic, the Trump Administration is arguing in
court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act and rip health coverage away from tens of millions of
people.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: President Trump and his Administration have also failed to drive an economic response that is
commensurate with the scale of the challenge before us, preferring to act as though the recession
caused by his incompetent mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic will correct itself.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: He has
hung small businesses out to dry while cutting blank checks to the largest corporations; failed to
enact adequate support for public school systems, colleges, universities, and state and local
governments to maintain public services and jobs; endangered the health of essential workers by
failing to enact workplace safety standards; and neglected to protect working families from
economic ruin.]

8

[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats will save lives by using every available tool to beat back this pandemic, which
continues to sicken and kill hundreds of Americans per day, and lead a global effort to prevent,
detect, and respond to future pandemic threats.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We must start by making COVID-19 testing widely available, convenient, and free to everyone.]
We must also expand funding so state and local public health departments can hire sufficient
staff to conduct contact tracing for everyone who tests positive for the novel coronavirus. Only
through widespread, regular testing and tracing can we hope to understand the scope of the
pandemic and contain it.
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: In a public health crisis, we all have to rely on each other. That’s why Democrats support making
COVID-19 testing, treatment, and any eventual vaccines free to everyone, regardless of their
wealth, insurance coverage, or immigration status. We are all only as safe from this disease as
are the most vulnerable among us.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: It has always been a crisis that tens of millions of Americans have no or inadequate health
insurance—but in a pandemic, it’s catastrophic for public health. The current crisis would be
even worse without the Affordable Care Act in place.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: But in the COVID-19 pandemic,
Americans need even more help, which is why Democrats will take immediate action to preserve
and expand health insurance coverage. We will provide direct, increased support to states to
enroll eligible adults in Medicaid, have the federal government cover a higher percentage of the
bill, and add incentives for states which have not yet expanded Medicaid to do so.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: For people who risk losing their insurance coverage if they lose their jobs in this pandemic and
in President Trump’s recession, Democrats believe the federal government should pick up 100
percent of the tab for COBRA insurance, which keeps people on their employer-sponsored plans,
without restrictions. We will re-open the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, even outside of the
normal open enrollment season, and expand subsidies to make it easier for people to buy health
coverage. Democrats will also make available on the marketplace a public option administered
through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) which includes a platinum-level
choice, with low fees and no deductibles. Low-income Americans will be automatically enrolled
in the public option at zero cost to them, though they may choose to opt out at any time.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will keep these emergency measures in place until the pandemic ends and unemployment
falls significantly. And should the United States find itself in another pandemic or severe
economic downturn in the future, these protections will be made automatically available, so
Americans are never again left to fend for themselves in times of crisis.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats are appalled that President Trump failed to act on the advice of Congress to maintain
a strong stockpile of critical medical supplies, including personal protective equipment, or
adequately surge U.S. manufacturing of needed equipment through tools like the Defense
Production Act.] The resulting equipment shortages endangered millions of lives, including those
of our brave frontline health care workers and other essential workers. Such shortages are
unacceptable and must never happen again. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats will direct the federal government to
work with private-sector manufacturers to dramatically scale up the United States’ domestic
9

manufacturing capacity for both personal protective equipment and essential medicines. We will
restore federal leadership to ensure medical supplies are distributed according to need, not
political favoritism, and never put states in the position of having to compete against each other
for life-saving materials.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will aggressively enforce non-discrimination protections in the Americans with
Disabilities Act and other civil rights laws, especially when designing emergency management
systems and new facilities and services in response to the pandemic.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats will prohibit
unjustified segregation of patients with disabilities, and additionally prohibit rationing of health
care that refuses or diverts hospitalization, treatment, or supplies based on a patient’s disability.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We recognize people with disabilities living in group homes and other care facilities are at
greater risk of contracting COVID-19, and that people with disabilities may require additional
resources to protect their health, well-being, and independence during the pandemic. We will
improve oversight and expand protections for residents and staff at nursing homes, which have
seen some of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: And we will expand support for telemedicine, so
Americans do not have to go without essential health care during the pandemic.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: America must never again be left vulnerable to a global pandemic.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats believe we must
follow the informed advice of scientists and public health experts, and will take steps to protect
federal scientists from political influence.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will act swiftly to stand up a
comprehensive, national public health surveillance program for COVID-19 and future infectious
diseases. We will recruit at least 100,000 contact tracers with support from trusted local
organizations in the communities most at risk to help state and local health departments use
culturally competent approaches to identify people at risk of contracting or spreading the
coronavirus.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats believe we must reverse decades of underinvestment in America’s public health
infrastructure. We will substantially increase funding for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and for state and local public health departments, many of which suffered
deep budget cuts during the Great Recession and are at risk of further cuts as a result of President
Trump’s recession.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: State and local public health departments should be given sufficient
resources to address pandemic diseases and other public health crises through coordinated efforts
that are inclusive of underrepresented groups who may be disproportionately impacted.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will support medical and public health research grants for Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), which are particularly
well suited to research health disparities in the context of COVID-19.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Solving the public health crisis posed by the pandemic is the surest way to get the economy back
on track.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: Countries that have taken aggressive measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic and
stop chains of infection from spreading are poised to have stronger, faster recoveries than the
United States.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: But containing the pandemic won’t be enough to repair the damage President Trump has done to
our economy and to the American people—or to build back better.]

10

[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: During acute economic downturns, Democrats believe that we must take care of our workforce
and aim to keep workers whole.] We will reform the current unemployment insurance system to
enable more workers to remain attached to their jobs, including by promoting payroll support
and work-sharing programs with generous rates of wage replacement and requirements that
employers maintain workers’ benefits. For those workers who do lose their jobs, we will expand
the unemployment insurance system to cover more workers, including independent contractors
and gig, part-time, and tipped workers; make sure platform companies and companies that
misclassify employees as contractors pay in to support the system like other employers do; and
raise wage replacement rates, which are far too low in many states. We will expand, not cut,
nutrition assistance and food security programs that millions of Americans are relying on in this
crisis. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will also make long-overdue investments to upgrade and modernize states’
unemployment system technology and ensure the Department of Labor conducts strong oversight
of state unemployment systems to make sure that unemployed workers can quickly and
efficiently access the benefits they are owed.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: To prevent President Trump’s recession from becoming a depression, Democrats believe we
must act immediately to make ambitious investments that will support and create jobs.] We
urgently need to support state and local governments, which are suffering severe budget
shortfalls due to declines in tax revenues while being asked to shoulder the burden of
COVID-related services and rising unemployment. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: State and local budget cuts translate quickly
into lost jobs in education, health care, and social services—all fields where we need to be
adding jobs to meet the needs of the American people.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will extend significant aid to
state and local governments, school districts, and public and nonprofit colleges and universities,
including HBCUs and MSIs, to address these budget shortfalls and secure jobs. We will
condition state and federal aid on maintaining and expanding public-sector employment,
including provisions to protect workers’ rights.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: In states and cities across the country, too many parents are being forced to choose between
keeping their jobs and keeping their children safe.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats believe that making child care
affordable and widely available is essential to recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.] We
will provide funding to stabilize the sector and ensure child care and educational settings are able
to meet the highest possible public health and worker safety standards to protect the health of
care workers, children, parents, and the broader community.
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The United States is facing an unprecedented housing crisis as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic and President Trump's recession, with millions of families at risk of being evicted.] We
support state and local measures to freeze rent increases, evictions, utility shutoffs, and late fees
for rent, to prevent families from becoming homeless and making the pandemic even worse.
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The COVID-19 pandemic has hit small businesses especially hard.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: Some estimates
indicate as many as 40 percent of Black-owned small businesses may not survive President
Trump’s recession, and small businesses owned by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and
Latinos are also at risk.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will prioritize support for Black entrepreneurs and other
entrepreneurs of color, as
11

well as women entrepreneurs, including by expanding funding for Community Development
Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and other proven programs that invest in low-income communities
and communities of color.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will impose rigorous oversight on big corporations seeking financial assistance to weather
the pandemic and President Trump’s recession, to ensure that federal dollars support keeping
workers on payroll, not enriching CEOs or shareholders.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Taxpayer money should not be used to
pay out dividends, fund stock buybacks, or give raises to executives.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: No one should have to choose between protecting their health and earning a living.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Paid sick
leave is a necessity even under normal circumstances, but in a pandemic, it’s a matter of national
security. This is especially true for the Black, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander,
Native American, and low-income workers who are less likely to be able to work from home.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will immediately enact robust paid sick leave protections as part of the COVID-19 response
for all workers in the economy, including contractors, gig workers, domestic workers, and the
self-employed.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: And Democrats will take immediate action to protect essential workers on the job
where the Trump Administration has neglected them, from agriculture to meatpacking plants to
manufacturing facilities to hospitals, including by issuing and enforcing effective infectious
disease workplace safety standards through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: As millions of Americans have stayed at home to prevent the spread of the pandemic, it is plain
to see that in the 21st century, an accessible internet is not optional: it is a vital tool for receiving
an education and for participating in the economy, and all Americans need access to high-speed,
affordable broadband service.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will take action to prevent states from blocking
municipalities and rural co-ops from building publicly-owned broadband networks, and increase
federal support for municipal broadband while requiring that funding recipients adhere to
policies that support good jobs and include strong protections for workers’ right to organize.] We
will increase public investment in rural, urban, and Tribal broadband infrastructure, offer
low-income Americans subsidies for accessing high-speed internet, and invest in digital literacy
training programs, so children and families and people with disabilities can fully participate in
school, work, and life from their homes. And Democrats will restore the Federal
Communications Commission's (FCC) clear authority to take strong enforcement action against
broadband providers who violate net neutrality principles through blocking, throttling, paid
prioritization, or other measures that create artificial scarcity and raise consumer prices for this
vital service.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: President Trump and his Administration have not only failed the American people, they have
failed the world.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: In past public health crises, including the Ebola epidemic, disciplined American
diplomacy shaped and led a common global response, rallied public and private resources,
accelerated research into treatments and vaccines, and directed global emergency aid.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: In the
COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump not only failed to lead, he actively sabotaged global
efforts to slow the pandemic.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: He refused to work with our partners to identify and coordinate
manufacture of potential vaccines; allegedly tried to poach exclusive rights to a vaccine
candidate from our ally Germany; cut CDC and State Department programs for early
identification of infectious pathogens; withdrew funding and support for the World Health
12

Organization (WHO); and tried to distract from his dereliction of duty by drawing from the
authoritarian playbook he so admires—using racist rhetoric to blame “outsiders” and stoke
divisions at home.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will take the opposite tack by restoring American leadership, driving a coordinated
global health and economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and ensuring that we’re far
better prepared for future global health emergencies.]
BUILDING A STRONGER, FAIRER ECONOMY
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: The economy is not working for the American people.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: In a matter of weeks, the abject failure of
President Trump and his Administration to competently respond to the COVID-19 pandemic
erased all the job gains made since the Obama-Biden Administration pulled the country out of
the Great Recession, and plunged the economy into recession once more.]
[TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: President Trump inherited the longest economic expansion in American history from the
Obama-Biden Administration, and he squandered it.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: Even before the COVID-19 pandemic,
President Trump was presiding over a recession in the manufacturing sector, after years of
growth in the Obama-Biden Administration.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: He had the audacity to pay for a permanent tax cut
for big business by raising taxes on working families.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: He launched a reckless trade war with
China that cost more than 300,000 American jobs and sent farmers into bankruptcy, decimating
the American heartland.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: He has left our communities vulnerable and exposed to the impacts of
climate change, let other countries outpace us in the clean energy revolution America should be
leading, and completely failed to fulfill his campaign promise to the American people to invest in
rebuilding and modernizing our nation’s crumbling infrastructure.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: But our economy was rigged against working families and the middle class even before the novel
coronavirus sickened millions and killed more than 150,000 Americans and counting. Working
families’ incomes have been largely stagnant for decades, while the cost of basic needs—from
housing to health care, higher education to child care—keep rising at precipitous rates.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Meanwhile, the rich have been capturing a larger and larger share of the economic pie, with
incomes for the top one percent growing five times faster than those of the bottom 90 percent.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: America bills itself as the land of opportunity, but intergenerational mobility has plummeted;
children born in the United States are less likely to move up the income ladder than those in
Canada, Denmark, or the United Kingdom.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Women still earn just 82 cents to every dollar men
earn, with even greater disparities for women of color.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Median incomes are lower and poverty
rates are higher for Black Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and certain Asian American
and Pacific Islander communities, compared to median white households.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: And there is a
persistent, pernicious racial wealth gap that holds millions of Americans back, with the typical
white household holding six times more wealth than the typical Latino family and 10 times more
wealth than the typical Black family.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: President Trump’s recession threatens to deepen existing
inequities, as Black and Latino workers are less likely to work in jobs that can be done safely
13

from home, less likely to have savings to fall back on, and less likely to be able to access
unemployment insurance and other emergency programs electronically.]
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: That’s bad for our economy, bad for our democracy, and bad for the soul of our nation.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: That is why Democrats commit to forging a new social and economic contract with the
American people—a contract that invests in the people and promotes shared prosperity, not one
that benefits only big corporations and the wealthiest few.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: One that affirms housing is a right and
not a privilege, and which makes a commitment that no one will be homeless or go hungry in the
richest country on earth.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: A new economic contract that raises wages and restores workers’ rights
to organize, join a union, and collectively bargain. One that at last supports working families and
the middle class by securing equal pay for women and paid family leave for all. A new economic
contract that provides access for all to reliable and affordable banking and financial services. A
new social and economic contract that at last grapples honestly with America’s long and ongoing
history of racism and disenfranchisement, of segregation and discrimination, and invests instead
in building equity and mobility for the people of color who have been left out and left behind for
generations.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats stand ready to take immediate, decisive action to pull the economy out of President
Trump’s recession by investing in infrastructure, care work, clean energy, and small businesses
to put Americans to work in good-paying jobs; shoring up state and local budgets to save jobs
and protect public health in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and enacting fundamental
reforms to address structural and systemic racism and entrenched income and wealth inequality
in our economy and our banking system.]
Protecting Workers and Families and Creating Millions of Jobs Across America
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Americans deserve an economy that works for everyone—not just for the wealthy and the
well-connected.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: But our system has been rigged against the American people.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats believe
that it is a moral and an economic imperative that we support working families by rebuilding the
American middle class for the 21st century, making sure this time that everyone can make it and
thrive, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, national
origin, age, or ZIP code.]
Raising Wages and Promoting Workers’ Rights
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will fight to raise wages for working people and improve job quality and security,
including by raising the federal minimum wage so it reaches $15 an hour by 2026.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Raising the
federal minimum wage, so fewer workers are forced to hold down multiple jobs to make ends
meet, will significantly decrease risks of infection from COVID-19 and in the future.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We know
that strong American labor unions help increase wages and job standards for workers across the
economy, which is why Democrats will prioritize passing the PRO Act and restoring workers’
rights, including the right to launch secondary boycotts.] We will repeal so-called “right to work”
laws that undermine worker power and lead to lower wages and less protection for workers
across the economy, and ensure those who have been left without wage and hour protections for
decades—including domestic workers and farmworkers—have the same rights as other workers.
Democrats will support legislation to strengthen whistleblower and anti-retaliation protections
for workers who speak for themselves or their coworkers. And we will take action to rein in
anti-competitive corporate power by rewriting the rules that have undermined workers’ ability to
advocate for themselves, including non-compete clauses, no-poaching agreements, and contracts
that force workers into mandatory arbitration to resolve violations of employment laws.
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will recognize unions with majority sign-up—via “card check” processes—and ban
captive audience meetings, which employers use to bully and browbeat workers.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will hold
executives personally accountable if they interfere in workers’ efforts to organize, including
issuing criminal penalties for intentional obstruction.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will take action to guarantee that when
workers come to the table, they are able to bargain with the employers who actually hold the
power, including franchisors, and penalize companies that bargain in bad faith with their
workers.] Democrats will vigorously protect all private-sector workers’ right to strike without fear
of coercion, interference, and undue delay. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will also establish the federal government's role
in promoting and facilitating collective bargaining and helping the parties bring their
negotiations to a rapid and successful conclusion, committing to a high standard for intervening
in strikes, including under the Railway Labor Act.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The right of workers to come together and form a union is under attack.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We must unrig the rules
that block workers from having the union they want and update our labor laws to make it more
possible.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We must change labor law so that it is easier for unions and employers to enter into
multi-employer agreements establishing minimum workplace standards related to wages,
benefits, and working conditions.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats believe taxpayer dollars should never flow to employers who steal workers’ wages,
violate labor laws, engage in union-busting, or exploit immigrant workers to depress working
conditions for all workers.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will increase funding and staffing at the Department of Labor to
aggressively enforce wage, hour, health, and safety rules across the economy.] Democrats believe
employees who are being misclassified, including gig and platform workers, deserve wage and
workplace protections including minimum wage and overtime pay, and we support using the
ABC test to determine employee status. Democrats believe that all workers should be able to
hold their employers accountable for unpaid or underpaid wages, regardless of corporate
structure. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We support using grants and collaborative relationships with community organizations
to ensure that workers know their rights and responsibilities under the law.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will strengthen labor rights for the more than 20 million public-sector employees in
the United States by passing the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, which would provide
a federal guarantee for public-sector employees to bargain for better pay and benefits and the
working conditions they deserve.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We cannot hope to raise wages without taking on the profound racial biases at work in our
employment system.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The wage gap between Black workers and white workers is higher today
than it was 20 years ago.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: It takes a typical Black woman 19 months to earn what a typical white
man earns in 12 months—and for typical Latinas and Native American women, it takes almost
15

two years.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats believe we need to be much more proactive and aggressive in rooting out
discrimination in our employment system.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will increase funding to the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission and increase its authority to initiate directed investigations into civil
rights violations, violations of the rights of people with disabilities, and violations against
LGBTQ+ people, especially transgender women of color.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Federal contractors should be required
to develop and disclose plans to recruit and promote people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people,
people with disabilities, and veterans—and be held accountable for delivering.]
Enacting Robust Work-Family Policies
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The United States is alone among advanced economies in guaranteeing neither paid sick leave
nor paid family leave for all workers.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: This puts excessive burdens on working families, and
especially working mothers, even in the best of times, and is catastrophic for public health in the
midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will implement paid sick days and a high-quality, comprehensive, and inclusive paid
family and medical leave system that protects workers from the unfair choice between attending
to urgent health or caretaking needs and earning a paycheck.] We will fight to ensure workers are
guaranteed at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for all workers and family units, to
enable new parents to recover from childbirth and bond with their newborns, foster or adopted
children, and allow all workers to take extended time off to care for themselves or ailing loved
ones..
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Finding and paying for high-quality child care is an emotional, logistical, and financial tightrope
for too many parents, and that needs to change.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Working parents shouldn’t have to choose
between keeping their kids safe and earning a paycheck.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will make major investments
in quality, affordable child care, including by significantly increasing the Child and Dependent
Care Tax Credit and providing access to affordable, high-quality child care on a sliding scale by
boosting funding for grants to states to help low-income and middle-class families afford child
care.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will improve compensation and benefits for child care providers and enact universal,
high-quality pre-K programs for three- and four-year-olds. We will also invest in expanding
long-term services and supports and home and community-based care for seniors and people
with disabilities.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will increase wages and benefits for paid caregivers in all settings,
which will improve working conditions and quality of care while enabling family members to
rejoin the workforce.]
Investing in the Engines of Job Creation
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats believe the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Trump’s recession, demand
unprecedented, transformational federal investments to create family-sustaining and union jobs.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We believe that the world’s richest nation should have the world’s best infrastructure system.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: That’s why we will invest in resilient, sustainable, and inclusive infrastructure.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will
launch a clean energy revolution through historic investments in clean energy, clean
transportation, energy efficiency, and advanced manufacturing.]
16

[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will repair, modernize, and expand our highways, roads, bridges, and airports, including by
installing 500,000 public charging stations for electric vehicles, ensuring our passenger
transportation systems are resilient to the impacts of climate change, and using safe, modern
design approaches that allow drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, and others to safely share the road.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will launch our country’s second great railroad revolution by investing in high-speed rail and
passenger and freight rail systems, and commit to public transportation as a public good,
including ensuring transit jobs are good jobs.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: This railroad revolution will reduce pollution,
connect workers to good union jobs, slash commute times, and spur investment in rural
communities that will now be better linked to major metropolitan areas.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will invest to
ensure passenger transportation, including public transit, is affordable to all and accessible to
people with disabilities.] We will help transform Amtrak from a laggard to a leader in passenger
rail accessibility and ensure people with disabilities can receive compensation when disability
equipment, like wheelchairs, are lost or damaged by transportation carriers.
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will upgrade our nation’s ports, lock and dam systems, and freight infrastructure to
accommodate 21st century cargo, reduce air and water pollution, and create and maintain
high-quality, good-paying jobs.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will increase demand for American-made ships by ensuring
U.S. cargo is carried on ships flying our flag.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will make sure that every community in
America has access to clean, reliable drinking water and safe wastewater systems in their homes,
including by replacing dangerous lead pipes.] We will increase investment in innovative water
technologies, including water use efficiency, water conservation, and water reuse and recycling,
that reduce water waste and consumer bills. We will modernize and green our public schools,
and ensure they are accessible to students with disabilities. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And Democrats will close the digital
divide that deprives more than 20 million Americans of high-speed internet access by investing
in broadband and 5G technology, including rural and municipal broadband, while ensuring those
investments support good jobs and include strong protections for workers’ rights to organize, and
restoring the FCC’s authority to take strong enforcement action against internet service providers
who violate net neutrality principles.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats support the creation of an infrastructure bank, a public bank that will leverage public
and private resources to build infrastructure projects of national or regional significance,
including in rail and transit, clean energy and water infrastructure, broadband, and affordable
housing.] Projects that receive assistance from the bank will be required to follow Buy America
and Buy Clean provisions, pay Davis-Bacon prevailing wages, utilize project labor agreements,
and ensure employers remain neutral in workers’ organizing efforts.
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: All federally supported infrastructure projects, whether existing or newly developed, financed
through grants, loans, tax incentives, or a national infrastructure bank, should create good, union
jobs that expand the middle class.] That is why Democrats will ensure labor protections,
Davis-Bacon wage standards, project labor agreements, collective bargaining neutrality, and
domestic sourcing requirements are included in any infrastructure legislation, and will block
anti-worker provisions, including forced arbitration. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: As we expand the clean energy technology
and infrastructure industry; we will fight to enact legislation that will drive the creation of family
sustaining jobs, with the high road labor standards with the provisions defined in the Good Jobs
17

for the 21st Century Energy Act.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Democrats support transparent, accountable, and sound
management of publicly owned infrastructure and assets, and will ensure that local jurisdictions
are adequately protected from partisan power grabs seeking to strip them of those assets.] We will
ensure robust federal oversight of any proposed transfers of ownership or operations, and will
oppose any policy that promotes the privatization of public services or infrastructure.
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats believe more products in our homes, stores, workplaces, and communities should be
stamped “Made in America” and will expand support for American manufacturing.] We will end
policies that incentivize offshoring, and instead accelerate onshoring of critical supply chains,
including in medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. We will expand effective tax credits that
support domestic manufacturing and grow rural manufacturing jobs through investments in
bio-based manufacturing. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will invest in innovation hubs and government programs to
provide small manufacturers with technical and business expertise so they can grow their
revenues and their workforces.] Democrats support robust Buy America and Buy Clean standards
for federally supported projects, which help increase demand for domestically produced and
low-pollution raw materials.
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: To ensure all workers can access the good jobs that will be created and supported by these
investments and build a diverse pipeline of talent across the economy, Democrats will invest in
career and technical education and high-quality job training programs with formal worker
representation in program development, including pre-apprenticeship opportunities and
registered apprenticeships.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We believe in the value of lifelong learning, and will increase
investments to support adult literacy and other skills development programs.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats know that small businesses are among the best job creators in our country.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will
significantly boost funding for state small business grant and lending initiatives that generate
tens of billions of dollars of private-sector investment, especially for small businesses owned by
women and people of color.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will increase access to credit for small businesses in low-income
and rural areas, including for unbanked or underbanked businesses.] And we will increase
funding for programs supporting businesses owned by women and people of color, including
ending the Trump Administration’s effort to starve the Minority Business Development Agency,
improving and expanding Small Business Administration (SBA) programs that most effectively
support women- and minority-owned businesses, and increasing opportunities for women- and
minority-owned businesses to obtain or participate in federal contracts.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will invest in the American heartland and rural communities.] We will make it easier
for new and beginning farmers, aquaculture farmers, ranchers, and foresters, including returning
veterans, to start and grow their operations by expanding U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) ownership and operating loan programs. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Recognizing the history of racial
discrimination in USDA’s core farming programs, Democrats will continue the reform efforts
started under the Obama-Biden Administration to ensure USDA takes a more proactive approach
to supporting training and resources for farmers of color.] We will protect family farms and
promote food security, including by taking steps to limit foreign ownership of U.S. farmland and
reforming agricultural subsidies to better support small- and mid-sized farms. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats believe
farmers should have the right to repair their own farming equipment, rather than being forced to
18

rely on large corporations for even the simplest fixes.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will expand domestic markets for
family farmers and ranchers by developing and growing regional food systems to deliver fresh,
American-grown produce to schools, hospitals, Department of Defense installations, and other
major public institutions, so small, mid-size, and traditional farmers can stay competitive.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will partner with America’s farmers, ranchers, and foresters to make the U.S.
agriculture sector the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, which will spark a
revolution in agriculture and open up new revenue streams for farmers in energy and waste
products, and grow bio-based manufacturing jobs.] We will grow the nation’s biofuels
manufacturing sector, including by strengthening the Renewable Fuel Standard, supporting E15
blends, and supporting research, development, and deployment of advanced biofuels. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will
expand popular, voluntary programs for sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices that
help protect clean air and water and support wildlife habitats, including for threatened
pollinators.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will invest in research and development to support climate-resilient,
sustainable, low-carbon, and organic agricultural methods.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: America’s farmworkers are essential to our economy, our communities, and our security.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We
will enforce labor and environmental protections for farmworkers, including overtime and safety
rules protecting workers from exposure to pesticides and extreme heat, and ensure farmworkers
are able to exercise their right to bargain collectively.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will empower small and
mid-size family farms by tackling market concentration in agriculture, including by
strengthening enforcement of the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts and the Packers and
Stockyards Act.] We will also review federal guidelines to improve workers safety at facilities
that raise and process meat for consumption, and use the federal government’s procurement
power to incentivize the humane treatment of farm animals in accordance with
commercially-recognized animal welfare standards.
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The United States has long been a world leader in science, technology, research, and innovation.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats oppose the Trump Administration’s efforts to undermine federal scientific research
institutions, apply political screens to research grants, and interfere with the work of career
scientists—actions which have a chilling effect on scientific discovery and are damaging to
America’s economic competitiveness.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will support historic federal investments in
research, development, demonstration, and deployment, which will break new frontiers of
science and create jobs across the country in aerospace, artificial intelligence, advanced
materials, biotechnology, and clean energy and clean vehicles.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats support public
investments in technology and innovation that help create a stronger economy for all Americans.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will support women innovators and innovators of color, encourage diversity in technology,
and promote business models that reinvest in low-income communities and communities of
color.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats continue to support the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and
are committed to continuing space exploration and discovery.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We believe in continuing the spirit
of discovery that has animated NASA’s human space exploration, in addition to its scientific and
medical research, technological innovation, and educational mission that allows us to better
understand our own planet and place in the universe.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will strengthen support for the United
19

States' role in space through our continued presence on the International Space Station, working
in partnership with the international community to continue scientific and medical innovation.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We support NASA's work to return Americans to the moon and go beyond to Mars, taking the
next step in exploring our solar system.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats additionally support strengthening NASA and
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Earth observation missions to better
understand how climate change is impacting our home planet.]
Building A Fair System of International Trade for Our Workers
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: For too long, the global trading system has failed to keep its promises to American workers.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Too
many corporations have rushed to outsource jobs, and too many countries have broken their
promises to be honest and transparent partners.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the risks of
relying too heavily on global supply chains, as shutdowns and shortages have created chaos for
workers and consumers and made our public health response even more challenging.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: The Trump
Administration has failed time after time to deliver for American workers on this crucial issue,
siding with corporate interests over our workers and launching a trade war with China that they
have no plan for winning—creating incredible hardship for American farmers, manufacturers,
workers, and consumers in the process.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will pursue a trade policy that puts workers first.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will negotiate strong and
enforceable standards for labor, human rights, and the environment in the core text of our trade
deals.] Future trade agreements should build on the pro-labor provisions added to the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) by Democratic members of Congress.
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats will take aggressive action against China or any other country that tries to undercut
American manufacturing by manipulating their currencies and maintaining a misaligned
exchange rate with the dollar, dumping products like steel and aluminum in our markets, or
providing unfair subsidies.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Unlike President Trump, we will stand up to efforts from China and
other state actors to steal America’s intellectual property and will demand China and other
countries cease and desist from conducting cyberes
pionage against our companies.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will eliminate President Trump’s tax and trade policies that encourage big corporations to
ship jobs overseas and evade paying their fair share of taxes.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: If companies shut down their
operations here and outsource jobs, we’ll claw back any public investments or benefits they
received from taxpayers.] And we will take immediate action to repair the damage President
Trump’s reckless policies have done to American farmers, by working with our allies to stand up
to China and negotiate from the strongest possible position.
Putting Homeownership in Reach and Guaranteeing Safe Housing for Every American
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Homeownership is at the center of the American Dream—and yet it has never been in reach for
all.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Decades of red-lining, rising income inequality, and predatory lending practices targeting
low-income families and people of color have made homeownership all but impossible for
millions of working families.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Homeownership has long been central to building generational
wealth, and expanding access to homeownership to those who have been unfairly excluded and
20

discriminated against is critical to closing the racial wealth gap.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We have a nationwide shortage
of affordable housing units, and tens of millions of Americans live in homes that pose risks to
their health and safety.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Homelessness has reached crisis proportions in a growing number of
states, and housing costs that rise faster than wages have put the squeeze on renters in many of
our biggest cities.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Housing in America should be stable, accessible, safe, healthy, energy efficient, and, above all,
affordable.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: No one should have to spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing, so
families have ample resources left to meet their other needs and save for retirement.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats believe the government should take aggressive steps to increase the supply of
housing, especially affordable housing, and address long-standing economic and racial inequities
in our housing markets.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We support innovative approaches to eliminating the racial wealth gap in
America. Rehabilitating housing and expansion of housing owned by land trusts will increase the
amount of housing available for secure homeownership.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will equalize access to affordable
credit and improve access to down payment assistance to help families of color, low-income
families, and rural buyers purchase homes.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will increase funding for assistance to first-time
purchasers and homeowners to navigate the financing and servicing of their homes.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will
create a new tax credit of up to $15,000 to help first-time homebuyers, and will make the tax
credit refundable and advanceable, so buyers can get assistance at the time of purchase, instead
of having to wait until they file their taxes.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will supercharge investment in the Housing Trust Fund to greatly expand the number
of affordable, accessible housing units on the market.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will expand the Low-Income Housing
Tax Credit to incentivize private-sector construction of affordable housing, and make sure urban,
suburban, and rural areas all benefit.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will make energy efficiency upgrades for millions of
low-income households, affordable housing units, and public housing units in metropolitan and
rural areas to save families money on their energy bills and provide safe and healthy homes.] And
Democrats will leverage existing programs, including at USDA, to build more affordable,
accessible housing and retrofit existing housing in rural areas. We will ensure all federally
supported housing projects, from new builds to retrofits, include mandatory requirements for
labor standards, accessibility, and civil rights protections.
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats are committed to ending homelessness in America.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats commit to providing
Section 8 housing support for every eligible family, and will enact protections to keep landlords
from discriminating against voucher recipients.] We will increase investments in public housing
to expand availability for the first time since the 1990s, and improve and upgrade existing public
housing to ensure safe living conditions for residents, protecting tenants’ rights to return if
extensive renovations are needed. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats support a housing-first approach to ending
homelessness, because having a stable and safe place to live is essential to helping a person
tackle any other challenges they may face, from mental illness to substance use disorders to
post-traumatic stress disorder.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will act swiftly to end homelessness among veterans and will
enact strong protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer youth, especially
Black, Latino, and Native American LGBTQ+ youth, who too often find themselves on the
streets.]
21

[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will enact a new Homeowner and Renter Bill of Rights to protect families from
abusive lenders and landlords.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will empower renters by working to establish a national tenant
right to organize, and support outreach and education to help tenants advocate to preserve and
expand affordable housing.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And Democrats will provide legal support to fight wrongful
evictions.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: America’s history of using public policy and private lending restrictions to close neighborhoods
off to Black families and other people of color and strip equity from their communities is long,
painful, and unresolved to this day.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The Trump Administration has made matters worse by
gutting fair lending and fair housing protections for homeowners.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will vigorously
enforce the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Affirmatively Furthering
Fair Housing rule, and the disparate impact standard, and hold lenders accountable for
discriminatory practices.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will also ensure that federal housing programs are better designed
to affirmatively further fair housing.] We will use the federal government to enforce settlements
against discriminatory lenders, and require communities to proactively review housing patterns
and remedy local policies that have a discriminatory effect. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will work to ensure that
residential property and mortgage ownership records are publicly available and easily accessible,
so that homeowners can always know who services their mortgage and who truly owns their
debt.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will give local elected officials tools and resources to combat gentrification,
penalize predatory lending practices, and maintain homeownership, including exploring targeted
rental relief when exorbitant rent increases force long-term residents from their communities and
tackling persistent racial bias in appraisals that contributes to the racial wealth gap.]
Leveling the Economic Playing Field
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: The U.S. economy is rigged against the American people.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Time after time, President Trump and
the Republicans have rewarded big corporations and their wealthy donors, and left working
families behind.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will take decisive action to level the playing field for people of color,
working families, women, small business owners, and others who have been left on the sidelines.]
Reforming the Tax Code to Benefit Working Families
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Our tax system has been rigged against the American people by big corporations and their
lobbyists, and by Republican politicians who dole out tax cuts to their biggest donors while
leaving working families to struggle.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats will take action to reverse the Trump Administration’s tax cuts benefiting the
wealthiest Americans and rewarding corporations for shipping American jobs overseas.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will
crack down on overseas tax havens and close loopholes that are exploited by the wealthiest
Americans and biggest corporations.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will make sure the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will make sure investors pay the same tax rates as workers and bring an end to expensive and
unproductive tax loopholes, including the carried interest loophole.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Corporate tax rates, which
were cut sharply by the 2017 Republican tax cut, must be raised, and “trickle-down” tax cuts
must be rejected.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Estate taxes should also be raised back to the historical norm.]
22

[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will reform the tax code to be more progressive and equitable, and reduce barriers for
working families to benefit from targeted tax breaks, including the Earned Income Tax Credit
and the Child Tax Credit.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Our program of reform will provide immediate, marked relief for
working families, including more generous, refundable tax credits to benefit low- and
middle-income families, and easier and more equitable access to tax provisions that help working
families build wealth, including by equalizing tax benefits for retirement contributions and
providing more accessible tax breaks for homeownership.]
Curbing Wall Street Abuses
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The scars of the financial crisis that triggered the Great Recession are still present in our
economy and our society.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Financial institutions should never be “too big to fail.”] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will
work to reverse the over-financialization of the American economy and curb Wall Street
speculation by maintaining and expanding safeguards that separate retail banking institutions
from more risky investment operations, and ensuring Wall Street investors pay their fair share in
taxes.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will strengthen and enforce the Obama-Biden Administration’s Dodd-Frank financial reform
law, including the Volcker Rule, to protect American workers from the impacts of future
financial crises, and will support an updated and modernized version of Glass-Steagall.] And when justified by the law, we will back criminal penalties for reckless executives who illegally
gamble with the savings and economic security of their clients and American communities.
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will expand access to credit by creating a public credit reporting agency to provide a
non-discriminatory credit reporting alternative to the private agencies, and will require its use by
all federal lending programs, including home lending and student loans.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will strengthen
banking regulations, including the Community Reinvestment Act, to ensure equitable access to
credit and banking products for all Americans, and reinvigorate the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau (CFPB) to ensure that banks, financial institutions, and lenders cannot prey on
consumers.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We commit to revisit and repeal sections of existing bankruptcy law that frequently lead to
debtors losing their home as the result of medical debt, divorce, job loss, or just bad luck.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We
will also give bankruptcy judges the authority to "cram down," or modify, mortgages for primary
residences during bankruptcy proceedings, so working families can benefit from the same debt
relief tools currently available to those who own assets like vacation homes and yachts.]
Ending Poverty
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats remain committed to ending poverty and enabling all Americans to live up to their
God-given potential.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We recognize that the official poverty rate, as measured and communicated
by the federal government, fails to capture critical needs like housing, education, health care,
transportation, energy, and other necessities, and therefore understates the true share of
Americans living in poverty.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will support the 10-20-30 funding approach, to direct at least 10
23

percent of federal funding to communities where 20 percent or more of the population has been
living below the poverty line for 30 years or longer.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Directing more federal investment to the
communities most in need will help create jobs; improve and expand housing; modernize and
expand transportation, clean water, wastewater, energy, and broadband infrastructure; and
promote shared prosperity.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and guarantee equal pay for women, two
measures that in combination will pull millions of families out of poverty.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will make it easier
for working families to benefit from targeted tax breaks, including the Earned Income Tax Credit
and the Child Tax Credit, which too often go unclaimed by the lowest-income tax filers.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will
significantly expand affordable housing and build new public housing for the first time since the
1990s, and guarantee Section 8 benefits to all who qualify—all of which will help reduce
housing costs and increase housing availability for low-income families.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats believe health care is a human right.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will incentivize states to expand Medicaid
and enroll low-income people who do not otherwise have health insurance in a new, high-quality
public option without premiums.] We will double investments in community health centers and
rural health centers, and expand mobile health units, to make it easier for low-income people to
access health care.
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: In the wealthiest country on earth, it is a moral abomination that any child could ever go to bed
hungry.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will increase funding for food assistance programs, including SNAP, WIC,
and school meals.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will also remove barriers that keep the formerly incarcerated from
accessing food assistance.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Cuts to the Legal Services Corporation have imperiled access to justice in civil court for
low-income defendants and litigants alike in matters concerning access to public benefits and
housing, eviction proceedings, and custodial cases.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will significantly increase
investment in the Legal Services Corporation to ensure those who cannot afford private
representation can nevertheless equitably access the civil justice system and have their day in
court.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will provide substantially higher levels of support for programs and institutions that
boost economic development in America’s most impoverished communities, including by
doubling funding for CDFIs, expanding the Community Development Block Grant, increasing
the number of Rural Business Investment Companies, and expanding and making permanent the
New Markets Tax Credit.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: One in four American households are either unbanked or underbanked, putting them at risk of
losing money due to exorbitant fees or usurious interest rates.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will support and
encourage efforts in Congress to guarantee affordable, transparent, and trustworthy banking
services that are language-accessible for low- and middle-income families, including bank
accounts and real-time payment systems through the Federal Reserve and easily accessible
service locations, like postal banking.]

Protecting Consumer Rights and Privacy
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Consumers, workers, students, retirees, and investors who have been mistreated by businesses
should never be denied their right to fight for fair treatment under the law.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will
support efforts to eliminate the use of forced arbitration clauses in employment and service
contracts, which unfairly strip consumers, workers, students, retirees, and investors of their right
to their day in court.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: In the 21st century—and especially in the COVID-19 pandemic—it is all but impossible for
consumers, students, workers, and people with disabilities to opt out of using the internet to
shop, socialize, learn, work, bank, and live.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats are committed to policies that will protect
individuals’ privacy and data rights while continuing to support and enable innovation and
improve accessibility in the technology sector.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will update the Consumer Privacy Bill of
Rights proposed by the Obama-Biden Administration, including adding strong national standards
to protect consumers, employees, patients, and students from data breaches, and work with
Congress to pass it into law.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will take additional steps to protect student data privacy,
particularly in preschool and K-12 settings where most students are under 18, and ensure that
data collected in schools is used only for education, not for commercial purposes.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we
support updating the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which has not been significantly
amended since the 1980s, to afford the same protections to digital content as physical content.]
Tackling Runaway Corporate Concentration
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats are concerned that the increase in corporate concentration across a wide range of
industries, from hospitals and pharmaceutical companies to agribusiness and retail chains, could
be stifling competition and innovation and creating monopoly conditions that harm consumers.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will direct federal regulators to review a subset of the mergers and acquisitions that have
taken place since President Trump took office, prioritizing the pharmaceutical, health care,
telecommunications, technology, and agricultural industries, to assess whether any have
increased market concentration, raised consumer prices, demonstrably harmed workers,
increased racial inequality, reduced competition, or constricted innovation, and assign
appropriate remedies.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will direct regulators to consider potential effects of future
mergers on the labor market, on low-income and marginalized communities, and on racial
equity, as well as on consumer prices and market competition.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And as a last resort, regulators
should consider breaking up corporations if they find they are using their market power to
engage in anti-competitive activities.]
Guaranteeing a Secure and Dignified Retirement
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats are proud to be the party that advocates retirement security for all.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We are the party
that created and strengthened Social Security, and defended public and private retirement plans
that provide a decent monthly income.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we are fighting to make sure that all workers have
the ability to save at work for emergencies and for retirement.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Social Security is the most enduring thread in our nation’s social safety net.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will enact
policies to make Social Security more progressive, including increasing benefits for all
25

beneficiaries, meaningfully increasing minimum benefit payments, increasing benefits for
long-duration beneficiaries, and protecting surviving spouses from benefit cuts.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will
eliminate provisions that unfairly reduce public sector workers’ earned Social Security benefits.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: In light of weakened retirement security for unpaid caregivers and caregivers for family
members, who sacrifice not only wages but Social Security benefits when they swap paid labor
for unpaid care work, Democrats support Social Security reform which better accounts for the
challenges facing unpaid caregivers—including incremental reforms to the benefit formula to
mitigate the penalty for unpaid care.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats will reject every effort to cut, privatize, or weaken Social Security, including attempts
to raise the retirement age, diminish benefits by cutting cost-of-living adjustments, or reduce
earned benefits.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will ensure Social Security will be there forever.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will protect Americans’ retirement security, especially in the midst of the COVID-19
pandemic, and take action to protect public and private pensions to ensure workers keep the
benefits they have earned, including through multiemployer plans.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats oppose changes to
the multiemployer pension system that would endanger workers’ and retirees’ pensions,
including composite pension plans.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We support amending federal bankruptcy laws to protect
workers’ earned pensions from being taken away by employers going through bankruptcy.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will also make it easier to save for retirement beyond Social Security.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will support
approaches to retirement saving that enable workers and retirees to prepare for and prosper in
retirement, including reforms that will allow states and municipalities to create public individual
and pooled retirement account options that are easy for workers to access and understand.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We
will advocate federal legislation to make it easy for all workers to save, not just those in states or
municipalities that have established their own programs.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats believe that when workers
are saving for retirement, the financial advisors they consult should be legally obligated to put
their client's best interests first.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will take immediate action to reverse the Trump
Administration's regulations allowing financial advisors to prioritize their self-interest over their
clients' financial wellbeing.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And Democrats will equalize the network of retirement savings tax
breaks so that working people can build their nest eggs faster, while also providing more
equitable access to these accounts through automatic enrollment and relaxed contribution
restrictions for unpaid caregivers.]
ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL, AFFORDABLE, QUALITY HEALTH CARE
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats have fought to achieve universal health care for a century.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We are proud to be the
party of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Because of the Obama-Biden
Administration and the Affordable Care Act, more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing
conditions, from heart disease to asthma, are secure in the knowledge that insurance companies
can no longer discriminate against them. Women can no longer be charged more than men just
because of their gender. And more Americans are able to get health coverage than ever before.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats will keep up the fight until all Americans can access secure, affordable, high-quality
health insurance—because as Democrats, we fundamentally believe health care is a right for all,
not a privilege for the few.]
26

[MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Unfortunately, at every turn, Democrats’ efforts to guarantee health coverage have been met by
obstruction and opposition from the Republican Party.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: It has been Republicans who have
embraced junk plans that undermine protections for pre-existing conditions.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: It was Republican
state attorneys general who sued to block Medicaid expansion and Republican governors who
refused to extend Medicaid coverage to their citizens, leaving millions of low-income
Americans, disproportionately people of color, unable to access health coverage.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: And in the
midst of the worst global pandemic in generations—one that has left more than 150,000
Americans dead and counting—the Trump Administration is fighting in court to invalidate the
entirety of the Affordable Care Act and eliminate insurance for tens of millions of people.]
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Overturning the Affordable Care Act remains a central plank of the Republican Party platform.
The difference in values between the two parties on this life-or-death issue could not be more
stark.]
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: The COVID-19 pandemic has made this difference in values painfully, brutally clear.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: President
Trump has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, bullied governors for enacting
life-saving public health measures, and left our frontline health care heroes without the
equipment they need to protect themselves and the American people.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The burdens of this
pandemic have not been borne equally, as communities of color have suffered higher rates of
infection and death, and struggled to access life-saving care when they need it most.] [PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: Our
essential workers have been deemed expendable by the President and his Administration.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: As Democrats, we say with one voice: no more.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We are going to at last build the health care system the American people have always deserved:
one that finally provides universal health care coverage; reduces prescription drug prices,
premiums, and out-of-pocket costs; reins in overall health care expenses; and tackles the
deep-seated inequities in our health care system.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will build a health care system that is driven
by the needs of patients and the people who care for them, instead of the profit motives of
corporations.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will tackle entrenched racial disparities in health care, reduce prescription drug
prices by standing up to big pharmaceutical companies, and make it easier to access mental
health and substance use disorder treatment and long-term services and supports in metropolitan
and rural areas alike.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats will always fight to save Americans’ lives by making it easier and more affordable to
go to the doctor, get prescription medicines, and access preventive testing and treatments.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Generations of Democrats have been united in the fight for universal health care.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We are proud
our party welcomes advocates who want to build on and strengthen the Affordable Care Act and
those who support a Medicare for All approach; all are critical to ensuring that health care is a
human right.]
27

Securing Universal Health Care Through a Public Option
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats believe we need to protect, strengthen, and build upon our bedrock health care
programs, including the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Veterans Affairs
(VA) system.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Private insurers need real competition to ensure they have incentive to provide
affordable, quality coverage to every American.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: To achieve that objective, we will give all Americans the choice to select a high-quality,
affordable public option through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: The public option will
provide at least one plan choice without deductibles; will be administered by CMS, not private
companies; and will cover all primary care without any co-payments and control costs for other
treatments by negotiating prices with doctors and hospitals, just like Medicare does on behalf of
older people.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Everyone will be eligible to choose the public option or another Affordable Care Act
marketplace plan.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: To help close the persistent racial gap in insurance rates, Democrats will
expand funding for Affordable Care Act outreach and enrollment programs, so every American
knows their options for securing quality, affordable coverage.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: The lowest-income Americans, including more than four million adults who should be eligible
for Medicaid but who live in states where Republican governors have refused to expand the
program, will be automatically enrolled in the public option without premiums; they may opt out
at any time.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will enable millions of older workers to choose between their
employer-provided plans, the public option, or enrolling in Medicare when they turn 60, instead
of having to wait until they are 65.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats are categorically opposed to raising the
Medicare retirement age.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will also empower the states, as laboratories of democracy, to use Affordable Care
Act innovation waivers to develop locally tailored approaches to health coverage, including by
removing barriers to states that seek to experiment with statewide universal health care
approaches.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We also know that finally covering every American through the public and private insurance
system alone is not enough to guarantee universal access.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: That why Democrats support
doubling investments in community health centers and rural health clinics in underserved urban
and rural areas, including increased support for dental care, mental health care, and substance use
services like medication-assisted treatment, and why we will increase support for mobile health
clinics.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will enact longer, multi-year funding cycles for these critical health services so they
can operate with greater certainty, as community health centers are the nation’s only providers
that are required by law to be both located in medically underserved areas and required to serve
all who seek care, regardless of their ability to pay.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will leverage innovative payment
options through Medicare and Medicaid to help community health centers and rural health
clinics keep their doors open.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will expand the National Health Service Corps and Teaching
Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program to grow a diverse primary care workforce
28

and to address critical shortages of health care providers in medically underserved rural and
urban areas, including primary care nurses, dental professionals, and mental health and substance
use counselors.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will also increase monitoring and enforcement to ensure that health
care facilities are accessible to people with disabilities.]
Bringing Down Drug Prices and Taking on the Pharmaceutical Industry
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Too many Americans struggle to afford the prescription drugs they need to get or stay healthy.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: No American should find themselves foregoing or rationing medications because they can’t
afford to pay—especially when taxpayer money underwrites research leading to the development
of many prescription drugs in the first place.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will take aggressive action to ensure that Americans do not pay more for prescription
drugs than people in other advanced economies, and ensure that all necessary medications are
covered.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will empower Medicare to at last be able to negotiate prescription drug prices for all
public and private purchasers—for families and businesses, as well as older Americans—no
matter where they get their coverage.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will also prevent the price of brand-name and outlier
generic drugs from rising faster than the inflation rate.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will cap out-of-pocket drug costs for
seniors, and ensure that effective treatments for chronic health conditions are available at little or
no cost.]
[MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: For too long, prescription drug companies have gamed the system to justify their price increases
by any means available.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will crack down on anti-competitive efforts to manipulate the
patent system or collude on prices.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will eliminate tax breaks for prescription drug
advertisements.]
Reducing Health Care Costs and Improving Health Care Quality
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The United States spends more per capita on health care than any other advanced economy, and
has less to show for it.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Health care costs have been increasing for decades, with average
premiums for an employer-provided family plan topping $20,000 in 2019.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats know we
can reduce out-of-pocket costs for families while improving the quality of health care for all.] We
will make it easier for working families to afford high-quality insurance in the Affordable Care
Act marketplaces by ensuring that no one pays more than 8.5 percent of their income in
premiums and eliminating the cap on subsidies.
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats believe that when Americans are in the hospital or an emergency room, they
shouldn’t have to worry about whether their health care providers are in-network or not, which is
why we will outlaw the predatory practice of surprise medical billing.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will work to increase
price transparency in the health care system across all payers, and reduce paperwork through
uniform medical billing.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will vigorously use antitrust laws to fight against mega-mergers
in the hospital, insurance, and pharmaceutical industries that would raise prices for patients by
undermining market competition.]

29

[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Excessive prescription drug cost-sharing and voids in coverage such as dental, vision, and
hearing services can lead to severe health consequences for Medicare patients.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats will
fight any efforts to cut Medicare benefits, and support finding financially sustainable policies to
expand Medicare to cover dental, vision, and hearing.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will support policies that increase the number of primary care practitioners, registered
nurses, dentists, and dental therapists, especially in rural and low-income metropolitan areas, so
it’s easier for every American to access preventive and primary health care.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats value all
people and will actively promote wellness programs for all ages in our diverse communities for
better overall health.]
Expanding Access to Mental Health and Substance Use Treatment
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Every American who needs it should be able to access mental health care or substance use
disorder treatment, no matter where they live.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will aggressively enforce the federal
mental health and substance use disorder parity law and ensure that health insurers adequately
cover mental health and substance use treatment.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will also invest in training and hiring more
mental health providers, substance use disorder counselors, and peer support counselors,
including by expanding funding for health clinics, especially in rural areas, and increasing access
to these services through Medicaid.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Trauma has a profound effect on both mental and physical
health, and Democrats will support increased training for health care professionals, educators,
social workers, and other care workers in trauma-informed care and practices.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will oppose
efforts to weaken HIPAA and FERPA privacy rights of people with mental illness.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The opioid epidemic has devastated American communities, and the Trump Administration has
completely failed in its response, leaving millions of families desperate for help.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will
make medication-assisted treatment available to all who need it, and will require publicly
supported health clinics to offer medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction and approved
treatments for other substance use disorders.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We believe we must stop over-prescribing while
improving access to effective and needed pain management.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats recognize that
incarcerated people suffer from serious mental health and substance use disorders at higher rates
than the general population, which is why we will support expanded access to mental health and
substance use disorder care in prisons and for returning citizens.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will ensure no one is
incarcerated solely for drug use, and support increased use of drug courts, harm reduction
interventions, and treatment diversion programs for those struggling with substance use
disorders.]
Expanding Long-Term Care Services and Supports
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of people who reside in institutional
settings, such as nursing homes and independent living facilities, and made clear that biases
within Medicaid create undue barriers to home- and community-based long-term services and
supports.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will work to eliminate waiting lists for home and community-based care
and the institutional bias within Medicaid, making investments in building the capacity of the
Medicaid system to provide home and community-based services.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will modernize Medicaid
30

eligibility so people with disabilities do not have to work low-wage jobs to access needed
services, and to ensure the spouses of people with disabilities can maintain a certain level of
income and assets.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will also help Americans pay for long-term care by creating a tax credit
for informal and family caregivers and increasing the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will also pursue policies to improve nursing home staffing and quality standards,
strengthen accreditation processes, and combat corporate abuses in nursing homes and
independent living facilities.] And Democrats are strongly committed to protecting and enforcing
the Americans with Disabilities Act and fulfilling the promise of the ​Olmstead v. L.C. d​ ecision,
which found institutional segregation of people with disabilities to be unlawful.
Eliminate Racial, Gender, and Geographic Health Inequities
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The national statistics on American health care mask profound disparities in insurance rates,
access to primary and specialized care, and disparate health outcomes, which are a symptom of
those disparities in access.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the uninsured rate was nearly
three times higher for Latinos and nearly twice as high for Black Americans as it was for whites.
Some segments of the Asian American and Pacific Islander population faced uninsured rates
rivaling those of Black Americans and Latinos, and more than one in five Native Americans and
Alaska Natives was uninsured. Black children are far more likely than white children to suffer
from asthma. Latinos, Native Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and Black
Americans are diagnosed with diabetes at higher rates than whites. And average life expectancy
is more than two years lower for rural Americans compared to those who live in metropolitan
areas.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We recognize it is not enough to have a commitment to eliminating health disparities: we must
have a plan.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: That is why Democrats will launch a sustained, government-wide effort, with
leadership at the highest levels, to eliminate racial, ethnic, gender, and geographic gaps in
insurance rates, access to quality care, and health outcomes.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: That includes tackling the social,
economic, and environmental inequities—the social determinants of health like poor housing,
hunger, inadequate transportation, mass incarceration, air and water pollution, and gun
violence—that contribute to worse health outcomes for low-income Americans and people of
color.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We can and must fix these inequities by expanding coverage, making health care more
affordable, and tackling implicit bias in our health care system.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will ensure that
people with disabilities are never denied coverage based on the use of quality-adjusted life year
(QALY) indexes.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will ensure federal data collection and analysis is adequately
funded and designed to allow for disaggregation by race, gender, sexual orientation, gender
identity, geography, disability status, national origin, and other important variables, so that
disparities in health coverage, access, and outcomes can be better understood and addressed.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will expand access to health care for people living and working across the United States by
extending Affordable Care Act coverage to Dreamers, and working with Congress to lift the
five-year waiting period for Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program eligibility for
low-income, lawfully present immigrants.]
31

[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats remain committed to ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which disproportionately
affects communities of color and the LGBTQ+ community, and will support critical investments
under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and the Minority HIV/AIDS Fund.]
Protecting Native American Health
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Native American tribes have for too long been forced to cope with insufficient access to health
care and mental health services, nutrition services, and modern infrastructure.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats are
committed to pursuing environmental justice and climate justice, including for Indigenous
peoples and communities, and will invest significant new resources in clean water and
wastewater infrastructure, clean energy generation and distribution, and sustainable and
regenerative agriculture.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will make mandatory and work toward full funding for the
Indian Health Service as part of our commitment to pursuing strong nation-to-nation
relationships and honoring the United States’ trust obligations to Native American communities.]
Securing Reproductive Health, Rights, and Justice
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats are committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health, rights, and justice.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should be able
to
access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will
repeal the Title X domestic gag rule and restore federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which
provides vital preventive and reproductive health care for millions of people, especially
low-income people, and people of color, and LGBTQ+ people, including in underserved areas.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats oppose and will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to
reproductive health and rights.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will repeal the Hyde Amendment, and protect and codify the
right to reproductive freedom.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We condemn acts of violence, harassment, and intimidation of
reproductive health providers, patients, and staff.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will address the discrimination and barriers
that inhibit meaningful access to reproductive health care services, including those based on
gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, income, disability, geography, and other factors.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats oppose restrictions on medication abortion care that are inconsistent with the most
recent medical and scientific evidence and that do not protect public health.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We recognize that quality, affordable comprehensive health care; medically accurate, LGBTQ+
inclusive, age-appropriate sex education; and the full range of family planning services are all
essential to ensuring that people can decide if, when, and how to start a family.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We are proud
to be the party of the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits discrimination in health care on the basis
of sex and requires insurers to cover prescription contraceptives at no cost.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: These efforts
have significantly reduced teen and unintended pregnancies by making it easier to decide
whether, when, and how to have a child.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We believe that a person's health should always come first.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats will protect the rights of
all people to make personal health care decisions, and will reject the Trump Administration’s use
of broad exemptions to allow medical providers, employers, and others to discriminate.]
32

Protecting and Promoting Maternal Health
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Black women are more than three times as likely to die from complications of pregnancy and
childbirth compared to white women.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: To save mothers’ lives, Democrats will expand postpartum
Medicaid coverage to a full year after giving birth, invest in rural maternal health, promote a
diverse perinatal workforce, and implement implicit bias training for health professionals.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will
support comprehensive solutions to address every dimension of the Black maternal health
crisis in America and eliminate all racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes, and
support policies and approaches that will at least halve our nation’s unacceptably high maternal
mortality rate.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We strongly and unequivocally support the decision to have a child, including by
ensuring a safe and healthy pregnancy and childbirth, and by providing services during
pregnancy and after the birth of a child, including adoption and social support services, as well as
protections against pregnancy discrimination.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We are committed to creating a society where
children are safe and can thrive physically, emotionally, educationally, and spiritually.]
Protecting LGBTQ+ Health
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We condemn the Trump Administration’s discriminatory actions against the LGBTQ+
community, including the dangerous and unethical regulations allowing doctors, hospitals, and
insurance companies to discriminate against patients based on their sexual orientation or gender
identity.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will reverse this rulemaking and restore nondiscrimination protections for
LGBTQ+ people and people living with HIV/AIDS in health insurance, including coverage of all
medically necessary care for gender transition.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will also take action to guarantee that
LGBTQ+ people and those living with HIV/AIDS have full access to needed health care and
resources, including by requiring that federal health plans provide coverage for HIV/AIDS
testing and treatment and HIV prevention medications like PrEP and PEP, gender confirmation
surgery, and hormone therapy.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats support increased community HIV prevention and testing programs which target
Latino, Black, Asian American and Pacific Islander, Native American, and other at-risk
communities to address the increases of HIV.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will recommit the federal government
to ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2025.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats are proud that the Obama-Biden Administration lifted the discriminatory lifetime ban
on blood donation by healthy gay and bisexual Americans.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will work to ensure blood
donation regulations are based on science, not fiction or stigma and that no American, when
seeking to donate blood, will face more stringent limitations than any other simply because of
who they are.]
Strengthening and Supporting the Health Care Workforce
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The COVID-19 pandemic has made plain to people across the country that our health care
workers are heroes.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Our doctors and nurses, our home health aides and physician’s assistants, our
public health professionals, our home care workers and nursing home workers, and our cleaners
and service workers have shown up to work every day despite dire shortages of personal
protective equipment.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Far too many of them have lost their lives to this terrible disease, and
untold thousands are suffering the mental and emotional strain of losing far too many patients.]
33

[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: And yet, despite the critical role they play in our society and our economy, these frontline
workers—a majority of whom are women of color—are often underpaid and lack access to paid
sick days, paid family and medical leave, health insurance, and other benefits critical for their
own health and the health of patients.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats believe that all jobs in the caring economy must come with family-sustaining wages,
good benefits, access to paid leave, fair and predictable schedules, access to training and
professional development, and the ability to join a union and collectively bargain.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We believe all
employers funded by taxpayer dollars must pay their workers at least $15 an hour and protect
workers’ rights to organize.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Although health care jobs are among the fastest growing in the economy, demand for services
still far outstrips supply, especially in primary care.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will invest in community health worker
care-forces around the nation proven to prevent, manage, and better treat chronic illnesses, and
empower first-time mothers with home visiting.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will close provider gaps and increase
diversity in the health care profession by creating a robust pipeline of talent with career ladders
for advancement.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will also increase opportunities for community health workers to come
from the communities they serve.]
Investing in Health Science and Research
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Scientific research is at the heart of medicine—and of health care.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats want the United
States to be at the forefront of scientific research and discovery for the benefit of our people, our
economy, and our global competitiveness.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will support increased and sustainable funding for
health and medical research and federal grants across agencies, including at the National Cancer
Institute and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the CDC, and the
Agency for Health Care Research and Quality.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will increase the federal investment in
research and development for new medications through the NIH, and make sure that there is a
return on that investment for taxpayers.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will also build on the foundation of the
Obama-Biden Administration’s Cancer Moonshot to break down silos and accelerate research
into cancer and cancer treatments by creating an agency with the sole mission of finding new
cures and treatments for cancer and other diseases.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats also support increasing funding for research into health disparities by race, ethnicity,
gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, geographic area, and socioeconomic status, with
a particular focus on how the social determinants of health contribute to differences in health
outcomes.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We support fully integrating people with disabilities in all stages of health and
medical research to ensure outcomes reflect the true needs of Americans with disabilities.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will take steps to increase the diversity of principal investigators receiving federal
grants, as well as of participants in federally supported clinical trials, to improve the quality and
applicability of our medical research for women and people of color, who are too often left out of
research on disease and medical responses to treatment options.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The Trump Administration’s systematic efforts to undermine, discredit, dismiss, fire,
disempower, and diminish the contributions of scientists, in health science and other disciplines,
34

have weakened our public institutions, slowed the pace of scientific inquiry, and profoundly
damaged America’s standing in the world.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will protect the independence and
intellectual freedom of scientists, whether they are employed by the federal government or
receiving federal grants in support of their research, and take steps to shield our scientific
research agencies from future political interference.]
PROTECTING COMMUNITIES AND BUILDING TRUST BY REFORMING OUR
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Our criminal justice system is failing to keep communities safe—and failing to deliver justice.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: America is the land of the free, and yet more of our people are behind bars, per capita, than
anywhere else in the world.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Instead of making evidence-based investments in education, jobs,
health care, and housing that are proven to keep communities safe and prevent crime from
occurring in the first place, our system has criminalized poverty, overpoliced and underserved
Black and Latino communities, and cut public services.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Instead of offering the incarcerated the
opportunity to turn their lives around, our prisons are overcrowded and continue to rely on
inhumane methods of punishment.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Instead of treating those who have served their time as full
citizens upon their return to society, too many of our laws continue to punish the formerly
incarcerated, erecting barriers to housing, employment, and voting rights for millions of
Americans.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats believe we need to overhaul the criminal justice system from top to bottom.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Police
brutality is a stain on the soul of our nation.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: It is unacceptable that millions of people in our
country have good reason to fear they may lose their lives in a routine traffic stop, or while
standing on a street corner, or while playing with a toy in a public park.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: It is unacceptable that
Black parents must have “the talk” with their children, to try to protect them from the very police
officers who are supposed to be sworn to protect and serve them.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: It is unacceptable that more
than 1,000 people, a quarter of them Black, have been killed by police every year since 2015.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats also recognize that all too often, systematic cuts to public services have left police
officers on the front lines of responding to social challenges for which they have not been
trained, from homelessness to mental health crises to the opioid epidemic.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We can and must do
better for our communities.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats know we can end the era of mass incarceration and dramatically reduce the number
of Americans held in jails and prisons while continuing to reduce crime rates, which have fallen
steadily from their peak nearly three decades ago.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: This is the moment to root out structural
and systemic racism in our criminal justice system and our society, and reimagine public safety
for the benefit of our people and the character of our country.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We must start by preventing people from entering the criminal justice system in the first place.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats believe we must break the school-to-prison pipeline that too often relies on arrests
35

and law enforcement to address misbehavior that ought to be handled and deescalated within the
school..] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We support re-issuing federal guidance from the Department of Education and the
Department of Justice to prevent the disparate disciplinary treatment of children of color and
children with disabilities in school and educational settings.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats believe every school
should have sufficient funding to employ guidance counselors, social workers, nurses, or school
psychologists to help guarantee age-appropriate and racially equitable student disciplinary
practices, rather than turning to police to resolve these issues.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: A growing number of states have recognized it is unjust—and unjustifiable—to punish children
and teenagers as harshly as adults.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We believe that if you aren’t old enough to drink, you
aren’t old enough to be sentenced to life without parole.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: The federal government will incentivize
states to stop incarcerating kids, and develop community-based alternatives to prison and
detention centers for youth and invest in after-school programs, community centers, and summer
jobs to provide opportunities for young people at risk.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And Democrats believe that children
who do enter the juvenile justice system should be given a true second chance, including by
automatically sealing and expunging juvenile records.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats believe we must ensure real accountability for individual and systemic misconduct in
our police departments, prevent law enforcement from becoming unnecessarily entangled in the
everyday lives of Americans, and reimagine policing for the benefit and safety of the American
people.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: In recent years, some innovative police departments have enacted evidence-based
reforms to change their approach by investing in robust training and putting in place—and, even
more crucially, enforcing—strong standards governing conflict resolution, de-escalation, and use
of force.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We must build on these evidence-based approaches and implement them nationwide.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will establish strict national standards governing the use of force, including banning
the use of chokeholds and carotid holds and permitting deadly force only when necessary and a
last resort to prevent an imminent threat to life.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Americans must feel safe when they are asleep in
their own homes. We will work to establish “no-knock warrants” standards. The risk of mistakes
and unintended consequences is too great. We will require immediate application of these
standards to all federal law enforcement agencies and condition federal grants on their adoption
at the state and local level.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will require officer training in effective nonviolent tactics,
appropriate use of force, implicit bias, and peer intervention, both at the academy and on the job.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will ban racial and religious profiling in law enforcement.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will support measures to improve training and education for judges, corrections
officers, prosecutors, public defenders, and police officers to ensure transgender and gender
non-conforming people receive fair and equitable treatment in the criminal justice system.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: It is past time to end the failed “War on Drugs,” which has imprisoned millions of
Americans—disproportionately Black people and Latinos—and hasn’t been effective in reducing
drug use.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats support policies that will reorient our public safety approach toward
prevention, and away from over-policing—including by making evidence-based investments in
jobs, housing, education, and the arts that will make our nation fairer, freer, and more
prosperous.]
36

[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will reinvigorate community policing approaches, so officers on the beat better serve
the neighborhoods they work in, and make smart investments to incentivize departments to build
effective partnerships with social workers and mental health and substance use counselors to
help respond to public health challenges.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Body cameras are not a panacea, but Democrats believe
they can help improve accountability and transparency; we support their continued use and will
take steps to improve compliance, require their use in blended federal-local task forces, and
promulgate best practices to protect personal privacy.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats believe weapons of war have
no place on our streets, and will once again limit the sale and transfer of surplus military
weapons to domestic law enforcement agencies—a policy President Trump reversed
immediately upon taking office.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We cannot create trust without holding those in power accountable for their actions.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats
will reinvigorate pattern-or-practice investigations into police misconduct at the Department of
Justice, and strengthen them through new subpoena powers and expanded oversight to address
systemic misconduct by prosecutors.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Far too often, the law has shielded police officers who
stand accused of heinous violations of civil and human rights.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats support lowering the
intent standard for federally prosecuting law enforcement officials for civil rights violations.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We
will also act to ensure that victims of federal, state, or local law enforcement abuses of power can
seek justice through civil litigation by reining in the doctrine of qualified immunity.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: The American people deserve access to timely and accurate data on activities supported by their
tax dollars, including policing.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will collect and publish data on the use of force in police
departments across the country to promote transparency and accountability.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: To increase
transparency and improve federal, state, and local law enforcement hiring practices, Democrats
will also establish a national registry of officers who have been found to have abused their
power.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats also support measures to increase diversity among the ranks of police departments, so
our law enforcement agencies look more like the communities they serve.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will seek
increased funding for officer health and well-being in police departments across the country,
including for personal safety equipment and mental health services.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Substance use disorders are diseases, not crimes.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats believe no one should be in prison
solely because they use drugs.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will decriminalize marijuana use and reschedule it
through executive action on the federal level.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will support legalization of medical marijuana,
and believe states should be able to make their own decisions about recreational use.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The Justice
Department should not launch federal prosecutions of conduct that is legal at the state level.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: All
past criminal convictions for cannabis use should be automatically expunged.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And rather than
involving the criminal justice system, Democrats support increased use of drug courts, harm
reduction interventions, and treatment diversion programs for those struggling with substance
use disorders.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Poverty is not a crime, and it should not be treated as one.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats support eliminating the use
of cash bail and believe no one should be imprisoned merely for failing to pay fines or fees, or
37

have their driver's licenses revoked for unpaid tickets or simple violations.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Equal justice under
the law should not be contingent on the ability to pay for quality legal representation, which is
why we support increasing funding for public defenders and for the Legal Services Corporation.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Since 1990, the United States has grown by one-third, the number of cases in federal district
courts has increased by 38 percent, federal circuit court filings have risen by 40 percent, and
federal cases involving a felony defendant are up 60 percent, but we have not expanded the
federal judiciary to reflect this reality in nearly 30 years.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will commit to creating new
federal district and circuit judgeships consistent with recommendations from the Judicial
Conference.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Sentencing decisions should be based on the facts of each case, including the severity of the
offense and individuals’ circumstances.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats support allowing judges to determine
appropriate sentences, which is why we will fight to repeal federal mandatory minimums,
incentivize states to do the same, and make all sentencing reductions retroactive so judges can
reconsider past cases where their hands were tied.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We believe it is long past time to end the
federal sentencing disparity between crack and powdered cocaine, which has contributed to the
disproportionate imprisonment of people of color.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And Democrats continue to support abolishing
the death penalty.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Our courts should reflect our country.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will appoint people to the bench who are
committed to seeing justice be served, and treating each case on its merits.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will nominate and
confirm federal judges who have diverse backgrounds and experiences, including as public
defenders, legal aid attorneys, and civil rights lawyers.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats are proud that the Obama-Biden Administration commuted the sentences of more
than 1,700 people serving unjust sentences following thorough review of their individual cases,
and we support the continued use of the President’s clemency powers to secure the release of
those serving unduly long sentences.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: We denounce President Trump’s inappropriate use of
clemency to help his friends and political cronies avoid justice.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We also support establishing an
independent clemency board to ensure an appropriate, effective process for using clemency,
especially to address systemic racism and other priorities.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Private profit should not motivate the provision of vital public services, including in the criminal
justice system.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats support ending the use of private prisons and private detention
centers, and will take steps to eliminate profiteering from diversion programs, commercial bail,
electronic monitoring, prison commissaries, and reentry and treatment programs.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats
believe prisoners should have a meaningful opportunity to challenge wrongful convictions and
unconstitutional conditions in prisons.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We also believe that too many of our jails and prisons
subject people to inhumane treatment, and will work to end practices like solitary confinement
for adults and juveniles, ban the use of restraints on pregnant federal inmates, and ban the use of
chokeholds and carotid holds.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Incarcerated people must not be denied access to vital medical
care or unnecessarily exposed to disease, as they have been during the COVID-19 pandemic.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And Democrats will pursue a holistic approach to rehabilitation, increasing support for programs
38

that provide educational opportunities, including pursuing college degrees, for those in the
criminal justice system, both in prison and upon release.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats believe in redemption.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We must deepen our commitment to helping those who have
served their time re-enter society, earn a good living, and participate in our democracy as the full
citizens they are.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We support the automatic expungement of certain criminal records for those
that have been fully acquitted, wrongfully convicted, or pardoned by the executive.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will aim
to ensure access to transitional housing for returning citizens, support expanded access to mental
health and substance use treatment, and will stop the practice of reincarcerating people for
technical violations of probation or parole.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats support federal and state efforts to “ban
the box” and will make it easier for returning citizens to access work opportunities through the
Job Corps.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The formerly incarcerated should not be blocked from exercising their voting rights
or accessing public services, including Pell Grants and nutrition assistance, available to other
free citizens of the United States.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Continuing to punish a person after they have rejoined the
community is both cruel and counterproductive.]
HEALING THE SOUL OF AMERICA
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats believe in bringing the American people together, not stoking division and distrust.]
[PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: President Trump has denigrated virtually every segment of American society—and in so doing,
he has insulted the very idea of America itself.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Healing the soul of America means facing up to
the deepest inequities in our society, from structural racism to misogyny to discrimination
against people with disabilities, and enacting ambitious measures to fix them.]
Protecting Americans’ Civil Rights
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats are committed to ending discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin,
religion, language, gender, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability status.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will
appoint U.S. Supreme Court justices and federal judges who look like America, are committed to
the rule of law, will uphold individual civil rights and civil liberties as essential components of a
free and democratic society, and will respect and enforce foundational precedents, including
Brown v. Board of Education a​ nd​ Roe v. Wade.​ [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats are committed to restoring the full
power of the Voting Rights Act and ensuring every citizen can access the ballot box.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will
enforce and strengthen the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act,
and will end racial and religious profiling in law enforcement.]
[MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: President Trump’s words and actions have given safe harbor and encouragement to racists,
anti-Semites, anti-Muslim bigots, and white supremacists.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: It’s time to root out domestic
terrorism in all its forms.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will use federal law enforcement tools and resources to address
domestic terrorism, and if necessary work with Congress to pass a domestic terrorism law that is
consistent with the Constitutional right to free speech and civil liberties.]
Achieving Racial Justice and Equity
39

[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Historic wrongs and abuses perpetrated against Native Americans, two and a half centuries of
slavery, a hundred years of Jim Crow segregation, and a history of exclusionary immigration
policies have created profound and lasting inequities in income, wealth, education, employment,
housing, environmental quality, and health care for communities of color.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats are
committed to standing up to racism and bigotry in our laws, in our culture, in our politics, and in
our society, and recognize that race-neutral policies are not sufficient to rectify race-based
disparities.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will take a comprehensive approach to embed racial justice in every element
of our governing agenda, including in jobs and job creation, workforce and economic
development, small business and entrepreneurship, eliminating poverty and closing the racial
wealth gap, promoting asset building and homeownership, education, health care, criminal justice
reform, environmental justice, and voting rights.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will ensure federal data collection
and analysis is adequately funded and designed to allow for disaggregation by race and ethnicity,
among other important factors, to better design policies to address the needs of the most
vulnerable communities and make informed policy choices.]
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Hate and its symbols have no home in America.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats believe that we can only build a
more just and equitable future if we honestly reckon with our history and its legacy in the
present.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We support removing the Confederate battle flag and statues of Confederate leaders
from public properties.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We recognize Black history has too often been intentionally suppressed
or excluded from our history books, and will invest in recovering, celebrating, and highlighting
Black history as American history.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats believe Juneteenth (June 19th) represents the end
of slavery, the freedom for millions of enslaved Black Americans, and should be recognized as a
federal holiday.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We believe Black lives matter, and will establish a national commission to examine the lasting
economic effects of slavery, Jim Crow segregation, and racially discriminatory federal policies
on income, wealth, educational, health, and employment outcomes; to pursue truth and promote
racial healing; and to study reparations.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We must acknowledge that there can be no realization of
the American dream without grappling with the lasting effects of slavery, and facing up to the
centuries-long campaign of violence, fear, and trauma wrought upon Black Americans.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The extreme gap in household wealth and income between people of color—especially Black
Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and certain Asian American and Pacific Islander
communities—and white families is hurting our working class and holding our country back.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats are committed to improving economic mobility for people of color.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will fight to
tackle intergenerational poverty and close the racial wealth gap.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats support policies to end discrimination and unfair practices in the housing market, will
empower local governments to combat gentrification trends that disproportionately harm
long-time residents of color, and will create a Community Restoration Fund to repair the toxic
legacy of historic investments in transportation that were designed to enforce racial segregation.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will equalize access to credit and expand support for first-time homebuyers to make
homeownership and the wealth-building it creates more accessible for people of color.]
40

[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats recognize that racial wealth gaps are rooted in longstanding discrimination and unjust
policies.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will equalize established pathways for building wealth while exploring innovative
approaches to closing racial wealth gaps, including policies that provide seed capital in order to
access the economic security of asset ownership.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The right to organize and collectively bargain benefits all workers, but especially for workers of
color.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Unions close pay gaps between white workers and people of color.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The union wage
premium is high for all workers, but remains especially substantial for people of color, including
Latinos and Black workers.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: This is one reason why Black workers represent a higher share of the
labor movement than the workforce as a whole.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Unemployment rates for people of color are persistently higher than the national average, which
is why Democrats support making racial equity part of the mandate of the Federal Reserve.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Specifically, we will work with Congress to direct the Chair of the Federal Reserve to report on
the extent of racial employment and wage gaps, and how the central bank is countering them, in
addition to monitoring, reporting on, and responding to macroeconomic conditions in general.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will invest in low-income communities, urban and rural areas, and communities of color by
strengthening the Community Reinvestment Act, improving federal support and access to credit
for women- and minority-owned small businesses, expanding and making permanent the New
Markets Tax Credit, and doubling funding for CDFIs.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will restore and build on the Obama-Biden Administration’s Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces
policy, and use the purchasing power of the federal government to incentivize private companies
to recruit and advance people of color, women, people with disabilities, and veterans.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats believe it is unacceptable that schools are more segregated today than they were in
the late 1960s.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We believe education is a critical public good, and will increase investments to
guarantee all students can access high-quality public schools, no matter where they live, so
students of color are well prepared to thrive in college and careers.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will break the
school-to-prison pipeline that sees children of color disproportionately punished by the criminal
justice system for disciplinary issues that should be handled by school administrators or
counselors.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately sickened and killed Black Americans,
Latinos, Native Americans, and certain Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, has
made long-standing racial and geographic disparities in health care and health outcomes into
front-page news.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will launch an all-of-government effort to eliminate health
disparities, including by achieving universal health coverage through a high-quality, affordable
public option; expanding funding for community health centers, rural health centers, and mobile
health clinics; and tackling environmental racism that sees communities of color
disproportionately impacted by air pollution, water pollution, and toxic chemicals.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: All people in the United States should be able to easily access public services, and all citizens
should be able to exercise their Constitutional right to vote without facing unjust or
41

discriminatory barriers.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will restore the full powers of the Voting Rights Act and go
further to roll back discriminatory policies that have been put in place in recent years to prevent
people of color from voting.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will ensure all federal agencies produce materials in languages
commonly spoken in the United States, including languages spoken by Asian American and
Pacific Islander communities, and that voting materials are also easily accessible for citizens
with limited English proficiency.]

committed to ending sexual assault, domestic abuse, and other violence against women,
including the epidemics of violence against Native American women and transgender women of
color.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Like the majority of Americans, Democrats believe every woman should be able to access
high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We oppose and
will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to women’s reproductive health
and rights, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment and protecting and codifying the right to
reproductive freedom.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And Democrats will take action to protect the rights of pregnant women in
the workplace, including by requiring employers to make reasonable accommodations for
pregnant and breastfeeding workers and those who have recently given birth and at last joining
other advanced economies by enacting paid sick days and universal paid family and medical
leave.]
Protecting LGBTQ+ Rights
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Democrats applaud this year’s U.S. Supreme Court decision that made clear that employment
discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity violates the law, but we know we
still have work to do to ensure LGBTQ+ people are treated equally under the law and in our
society.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will fight to enact the Equality Act and at last outlaw discrimination against
LGBTQ+ people in housing, public accommodations, access to credit, education, jury service,
and federal programs.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will work to ensure LGBTQ+ people are not discriminated against
when seeking to adopt or foster children, protect LGBTQ+ children from bullying and assault,

will ensure federally funded programs for older adults are inclusive for LGBTQ+ seniors.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Recognizing that LGBTQ+ youth and adults suffer from significant health disparities, including
mental health and substance use disorders, Democrats will expand mental health and suicide
prevention services, and ban harmful “conversion therapy” practices.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will ensure that all
transgender and non-binary people can procure official government identification documents that
accurately reflect their gender identity.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will stop employment discrimination in the federal
government, and will restore full implementation of President Obama’s executive order
42

prohibiting discrimination by federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation and gender
identity.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats are committed to ending the homelessness crisis, including among LGBTQ+ youth.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will fight to end violence against transgender Americans and particularly against Black
transgender women, who are disproportionately victims of assault and homicide, and will
prioritize the investigation of hate crimes against transgender and non-binary people.]
Protecting Disability Rights
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: One in four American adults live with a disability.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats believe people with disabilities
deserve to lead full, happy, and healthy lives.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will fully enforce the Americans with
Disabilities Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Civil
Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Mental Health
Parity and Addiction Equity Act, and the Help America Vote Act, among other bedrock statutes
protecting the rights of people with disabilities.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will oppose any efforts to weaken
enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will ensure non-discrimination in access
to health care, building on the protections for people with disabilities enshrined in the Affordable
Care Act.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will ensure every federal agency aggressively enforces the integration mandate
affirmed in the ​Olmstead ​decision, and repair the damage done by the Trump Administration.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will rigorously enforce non-discrimination protections for people with disabilities in health
care, employment, education, and housing, and ensure equal access to the ballot box.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats are committed to supporting the millions of Americans on the autism spectrum and
their families.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will expand early childhood screening, particularly in underserved
communities, and promote equitable treatment of students on the autism spectrum in schools and
educational settings, in keeping with our commitment to providing equal educational
opportunities for students with disabilities.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: By eliminating state waiting lists for home and
community-based care, ending the institutional bias in Medicaid, and expanding support for
informal caregivers, Democrats will enable more individuals with autism to receive the support
they need in their homes and communities.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will phase out the subminimum wage, expand competitive, integrated employment
opportunities, and protect and strengthen economic security for people with disabilities.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will
take a holistic approach to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security
Disability Insurance (SSDI) programs that are essential for millions of Americans with
disabilities by increasing SSI benefits, eliminating waiting periods for SSDI, and eliminating the
“benefit cliff” for SSDI benefits.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will increase federal funding to expand accessible
transportation and accessible, integrated, and affordable housing.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will protect people with
disabilities in emergencies and meet the needs of travelers with disabilities.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will ensure new

a way to pay for disability-related expenses like housing, education, and transportation.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And
Democrats will improve access to home- and community-based care for people with disabilities
and older Americans, including by enforcing the Medicaid Home and Community-Based
43

Settings Rule, ending the institutional bias within Medicaid, and expanding the home care
workforce to end state waiting lists for long-term services and supports.]
Honoring Indigenous Tribal Nations
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The U.S. government has a profound legal and moral obligation toward Native American Tribes
and Indigenous communities—a trust which has been broken time and again, undermining Tribal
nations’ ability to flourish politically, culturally, and economically.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats are committed to
honoring, upholding, and strengthening the United States’ trust obligations to Tribal Nations and
communities, as enshrined in the Constitution, treaties, federal statutes, and case law.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats recognize and support the sovereignty of Tribal Nations and pledge to work on a
nation-to-nation basis to empower Indigenous peoples, increase economic development in Tribal
Nations, and protect Tribal lands, assets, resources, and treaty rights.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We honor and support the
great Indigenous traditions all across the country.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We stand with the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe
and all Tribal Nations in rejecting the Trump Administration’s efforts to remove land that had
been put into trust by the Obama-Biden Administration.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will fight to enact a clean ​Carcieri
fix and support policies to restore Tribal lands, including culturally significant federal lands, by
moving land into trust, streamlining the land-into-trust process, and conducting land buy-backs.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will also support establishment of additional federal co-management agreements with Tribal
Nations on federal lands that have cultural and historical significance to Tribes.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats believe the federal government must commit to providing full funding to fulfill unmet
trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations and Native American peoples.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will work on a

challenge the best and brightest scientists, innovators, and entrepreneurs in the world to pursue
breakthrough opportunities in energy storage, heavy-duty trucking and freight solutions,
sustainable aviation fuels, and direct air capture and net-negative emissions technologies.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We
will advance innovative technologies that create cost-effective pathways for industries to
decarbonize, including carbon capture and sequestration that permanently stores greenhouse
gases and advanced nuclear that eliminates waste associated with conventional nuclear
technology, while ensuring environmental justice and other overburdened communities are
protected from increases in cumulative pollution.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: All of these investments will create jobs for
blue-collar workers, including in fenceline communities, help decarbonize American industries,
54

and create valuable new exports to help mitigate climate change around the world.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: America’s national parks and monuments, public lands, and marine protected areas are treasures
that should be held in trust for future generations.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will protect these precious places and
preserve America’s unspoiled wildernesses for hunting, fishing, hiking, and camping by
codifying the roadless rule, and grow America’s outdoor recreation economy, which supports
millions of jobs in rural areas.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats will immediately reverse the Trump Administration’s
harmful rollbacks of protections for national monuments like Grand Staircase-Escalante National
Monument and Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We support
banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters, modifying royalties to account
for climate costs, and establishing targeted programs to enhance reforestation and develop

and require full, rigorous, and transparent scientific and environmental reviews of any proposed

conserving public lands and waters and incentivizing voluntary conservation efforts on private
lands, including through private-sector ecosystems markets.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And Democrats will ensure
America’s public lands and waters reflect the diversity of our country by engaging all Americans
in the great outdoors, building a diverse workforce in our land management agencies, and
protecting landscapes, marinescapes, and cultural sites that tell the full story of America.]

RESTORING AND STRENGTHENING OUR DEMOCRACY
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Our government and our elections are supposed to reflect the interests of the American people,
not only the wealthiest few and the biggest corporations.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will fight to restore and
protect Americans’ fundamental right to vote, including by aggressively pushing back against
Republican governors, legislatures, and state officials who have disenfranchised people of color,
young people, low-income people, and people with disabilities.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will strictly enforce
ethics laws and improve transparency across the federal government in order to rebuild trust with
the American people, and will protect civil servants and whistleblowers from political
retribution.]
Protecting and Enforcing Voting Rights
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats are committed to the sacred principle of “one person, one vote”—and we will fight to
achieve that principle for every citizen, regardless of race, income, disability status, geography,
or English language proficiency.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We stand united against the determined Republican campaign
to disenfranchise voters through onerous voter ID laws, unconstitutional and excessive purges of
the voter rolls, and closures of polling places in low-income neighborhoods, on college
campuses, and in communities of color.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Americans should never have to wait in hours-long
lines to exercise their voting rights.]
55

[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will strengthen our democracy by guaranteeing that every American’s vote is
protected.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will make it a priority to pass legislation that restores and strengthens the Voting
Rights Act, and ensure the Department of Justice challenges state laws that make it harder for
Americans to vote.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will make voting easier and more accessible for all Americans by
supporting automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, early voting, and universal
vote-from-home and vote-by-mail options.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats believe Election Day should be a national holiday, in celebration of our democratic
institutions and to make it easier for everyone to cast their ballot.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats recognize that
unions, community groups, faith organizations and other civic organizations are critical to
facilitating registration, encouraging voting, and protecting voter rights.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will fully implement the Help America Vote Act and require that polling places and elections
are accessible for people with disabilities, and work to ensure that returning citizens have their
voting rights restored upon release from jail or prison without the additional hurdle of having to
pay fines and fees in order to vote.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will also fight for emergency funding for states to
help make vote-from-home and vote-by-mail universally available during the pandemic, while
ensuring that all jurisdictions take steps to ensure continued meaningful, safe opportunities to
vote in person.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We recognize that the United States Postal Service is more than ever a critical
component to our democracy and must be supported to guarantee timely and efficient delivery
and return of vote by mail ballots.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Election officials must be provided with sufficient time after
election day to process, count, and audit all ballots.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We must give voters the confidence that their ballot was counted as cast by supporting
mandatory, statistically meaningful post-election audits and full transparency of all election
results and data.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: To ensure every eligible ballot is counted, vote by mail voters must be informed
of and provided a meaningful opportunity to fix any problem with their ballot.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: A professional
and well-trained election workforce is critical to the administration of elections, we support
ongoing federal and state funding for local elections offices.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Gerrymandering distorts our democracy, and Democrats will enact measures to end partisan
gerrymandering in federal elections.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Efforts to redraw legislative districts following the 2020
Census must be guided by transparency and public input, while reducing the power of partisan
actors, so that maps reflect the will of voters, fairly represent communities of color, and provide
for competitive races.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will protect the integrity of the decennial Census from political
interference, including ensuring that apportionment and redistricting be based on total population
counts, and also ensure the Census Bureau is equipped to conduct cost-effective, timely, and
accurate surveys.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will maintain the legal requirement for Census participation and
increase resources to reduce undercounts of communities of color, immigrants, LGBTQ+ people,
people with disabilities, rural and low-income populations, and young children that have long
plagued the decennial Census.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will also direct the Census Bureau to study whether counting
the prison population where they are incarcerated creates inequitable outcomes in state or federal
representation or funding allocations.]
56

[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will increase investments to help state and local governments upgrade election
technology, including cybersecurity technology, and ensure that election technology is accessible
for people with disabilities.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will also increase oversight of private election vendors to
ensure voting systems are secure and worthy of voters' trust.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will not tolerate election
interference and will protect the integrity of our elections from all enemies, foreign and
domestic.]
Reforming the Broken Campaign Finance System
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats believe that the interests and the voices of the American people should determine our
elections.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Money is not speech, and corporations are not people.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will fight to pass a
Constitutional amendment that will go beyond merely overturning​ Citizens United a​ nd related
decisions like ​Buckley v. Valeo ​by eliminating all private financing from federal elections.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: In the meantime, Democrats will work with Congress on legislation to strengthen the public
funding system by matching small-dollar donations for all federal candidates, crack down on
foreign nationals who try to influence elections, and ensure that super PACs are wholly
independent of campaigns and political parties.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will bring an end to “dark money” by
requiring full disclosure of contributors to any group that advocates for or against candidates,
and bar 501(c)(4) organizations from spending money on elections.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will ban
corporate PACs from donating to candidates and bar lobbyists from donating, fundraising, or
bundling for anyone they lobby.]
Building an Effective, Transparent Federal Government
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Every federal employee swears an oath to support and defend the Constitution.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: It is a sacred
promise to the American people—that federal workers, both civil servants and political
appointees, will put the interests of the many ahead of their own personal concerns.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: President
Trump and his Administration have abused the trust between the American people and their
government—including by denigrating civil servants, directing federal grants and contracts
toward their cronies and political donors, inappropriately interfering with federal investigations
and firing independent watchdogs, retaliating against whistleblowers, failing to share information
as required with Congress, and, most nefariously, violating the law by withholding
congressionally appropriated funds in an attempt to get a foreign government to interfere in
America’s elections.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will establish a commission on federal ethics to aggressively enforce and strengthen
federal ethics laws, including rules around personal financial disclosures for Executive Branch
officials, and make campaign finance, financial disclosure, and lobbying disclosure filings easier
for the public to access and understand.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We support requiring all candidates for federal office,
including presidential candidates, to publicly disclose at least 10 years of tax returns.]

for them, not for special interests.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will re-establish merit-based federal contracting
decisions and prohibit political appointees, at the White House or in agency leadership, from
57

interfering in grantmaking.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will restore and re-empower independent inspectors general
across the federal government and work to strengthen whistleblower protections to fully protect
federal employees from retaliation.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will ban lobbying by foreign governments and
significantly lower the threshold for having to register as a federal lobbyist in order to close
loopholes that allow special interests to secretly influence policymaking in Congress and across
the federal government.]
[PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: Democrats condemn President Trump's determination to sow chaos and division by
inappropriately deploying federal agents to American cities, where too many have used
egregious tactics against peaceful protestors.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We know federal agents can ably protect federal
property while also clearly displaying badges, insignias, and identifying markings; without
detaining Americans in undisclosed locations without cause; and without brutally attacking
peaceful protestors.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats are committed to following the rule of law and will uphold the
First Amendment right to peaceably assemble.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The Republican Party has packed our federal courts with unqualified, partisan judges who
consistently rule for corporations, the wealthy, and Republican interests.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: They have undermined
the legitimacy of our courts through an anti-democratic, win-at-all costs campaign that includes
blocking a Democratic president from appointing a justice to the Supreme Court and obstructing
dozens of diverse lower-court nominees.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: The Democratic Party recognizes the need for structural
court reforms to increase transparency and accountability.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Now more than ever, federal agencies need experts on staff who know how to use science,
evidence, data, and facts to guide decision-making on behalf of the American people.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: As the
COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates, our country needs the best experts working within
government to protect and improve the lives of all Americans.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats support the
recruitment of people with expertise in science, social science, technology, and innovation to
jobs in public service to help solve our nation’s most pressing challenges.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: To ensure that federal
funds are invested as effectively and efficiently as possible, the federal government should be
using the best available evidence when making budget and spending decisions.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will
ensure federal data collection and analysis is adequately funded and designed to allow for
disaggregation by race, gender, LGBTQ+ status, geography, disability status, and other
important variables, so that disparities can be better understood and addressed.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats
support the widespread use of strategies to promote evidence-based policymaking, including
more robust evaluations of tax expenditures and allocating funds for program evaluation, to help
ensure the American people are receiving the most productive, efficient services from our federal
government.]
Making Washington, D.C. the 51st State
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: It’s time to stop treating the more than 700,000 people who live in our nation’s capital as
second-class citizens.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The residents of Washington, D.C. pay more per capita in federal income
taxes than any state in the country—and more in total federal income tax than 22 states—and yet
the District has zero voting representatives in the U.S. Congress.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The Congress retains broad
58

power to override budget decisions made by democratically elected officials in Washington,
D.C.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: And as was made shockingly clear to the American people this year, under current law,
Washington, D.C. does not have control over its own National Guard units and can be occupied
by military forces at the President’s whim.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The citizens of Washington, D.C.—a majority of whom are
people of color—voted overwhelmingly in favor of statehood in a 2016 referendum and have
ratified a state constitution.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats unequivocally support statehood for
Washington, D.C., so the citizens of the District can at last have full and equal representation in
Congress and the rights of self-determination.]
Guaranteeing Self-Determination for Puerto Rico
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: The people of Puerto Rico deserve self-determination on the issue of status.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats are committed to helping the island rebuild and recover from the devastation wrought
by Hurricanes Irma and Maria and the recent earthquakes, and will mobilize resources across the
federal government to address the island’s disparities in energy, infrastructure, health care,
education, housing, agriculture, employment, and disaster preparedness.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Disaster response in
Puerto Rico must be given the same priority and be conducted on the same basis as federal
responses to natural disasters elsewhere in the United States.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will forgive disaster relief
loans issued to Puerto Rican municipalities following Hurricanes Irma and Maria to help expedite
the island’s economic recovery.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The unequal treatment of Puerto Rico’s residents must end.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will invest in the island’s
future through economic development initiatives, increased education funding, construction of
affordable housing, and innovative energy and climate resilience programs.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats support
accelerating access to disaster recovery funds so the island can improve its infrastructure and
transform itself into one of the fastest-growing, most prosperous parts of the United States.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We
also believe Puerto Rico should be treated equally with respect to federal programs, including
Medicaid, SNAP, and the Child Tax Credit.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Bankruptcy blocks Puerto Rico’s growth and recovery.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will help restructure and
provide relief from Puerto Rico’s remaining debt burden and work with the government of
Puerto Rico to accelerate progress in order to dissolve the Financial Oversight and Management

Supporting the U.S. Territories
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats recognize and honor the contributions and sacrifices made in service of our country
by the Americans living in the territories of Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The people of the U.S. territories have
played a vital role in American democracy for more than 120 years, and have for too long been
met with unequal treatment by the federal government.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We support establishing a Congressional
task force to gather findings on voting rights in the territories, and recommend changes to
Congress to allow for the full and equal voting rights of U.S. citizens who are residents of the
territories in federal elections, and for full and equal voting representation in the U.S. House of
59

Representatives.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: The American citizens of the U.S. territories should have the right to vote for
President of the United States.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will support self-determination for the people of the
U.S territories, including respecting their right to decide their future status in a fair, binding, and
equitable manner.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The U.S. Virgin Islands suffered significant impacts as a result of Hurricanes Irma and Maria,
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and American Samoa have
suffered damages as a result of intensifying Pacific typhoons and cyclones.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will
support investments to help the U.S. territories recover from recent natural disasters and build
increased resilience to the impacts of climate change, including by expanding access to clean,
affordable, reliable energy and water systems.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will mobilize resources to address disparities
in agriculture, economic development, education, employment, energy, health care, housing, and
infrastructure in the U.S. territories to help the territories diversify their economies and recover
from the COVID-19 pandemic.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will improve health care access and affordability and support policies to address health
disparities in the U.S. territories.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We believe the territories should be treated equally with respect
to important federal programs, including the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, SNAP, and the

ensuring veterans from the U.S. territories have access to timely and quality health care and other
benefits through the VA.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will continue to work with the people of Guam to properly memorialize residents
who suffered unspeakable harm as a result of their U.S. nationality during the Imperial Japanese
occupation of Guam during World War II.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We recognize the increasing demands placed on state
and territorial governments by migration under the Compacts of Free Association (COFA), and
will explore mechanisms for increasing reimbursement of costs absorbed by Guam, the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Hawaii.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And Democrats will restore
Medicaid eligibility for migrants under COFA who are legally residing, working, and studying in
the United States, but who were inadvertently left out of health care legislation.]
Strengthening the U.S. Postal Service
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is the world’s most efficient mail carrier, and Democrats are
wholly committed to supporting a public USPS.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will fight all efforts to privatize the USPS
and will work to ensure the USPS is financially sustainable, including by repealing the mandate
that the agency “pre-fund” retiree health costs.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will protect the Postal Service’s
universal service obligation as a core American value and maintain six-day and doorstep mail
delivery, which is a lifeline for rural Americans.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will work to restore service to
appropriate levels, including overnight delivery of first-class mail and periodicals within the
same metropolitan area, maintaining six-day and door-to door delivery, and appointing members
to the Board of Governors and the Postal Regulatory Commission who champion a strong public
Postal Service.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will also support new revenue streams for the USPS, including allowing
secure shipping of alcoholic beverages by mail and exploring options to enable unbanked and
60

underbanked Americans to access financial services through the Postal Service.]

CREATING A 21ST CENTURY IMMIGRATION SYSTEM
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Out of many, we are one.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: That bedrock American idea has animated our country from its earliest
days, inspiring people from every corner of the earth to participate in our great democratic
experiment.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: The Trump Administration has repudiated that idea and abandoned our values as a
diverse, compassionate, and welcoming country.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Instead of pursuing a sensible, humane, and
responsible approach to immigration that strengthens the United States, the Trump
Administration has been callous, cruel, and reckless in the extreme.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: President Trump’s
immigration policies have made our communities less safe, undermined our economy, and
tarnished our image around the world.]
[MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: This Administration’s cruelty and dehumanization of immigrants stretches the imagination and
shocks the conscience: forcibly separating families and putting children in cages; deporting
veterans who have fought to defend our freedoms; conducting militarized raids on our
workplaces; endangering lives by denying COVID-19 testing and treatment based on
immigration status, including to essential workers at the forefront of the pandemic response;
banning people from traveling to the United States based on their faith or their country of origin;
and turning away refugees and asylum seekers fleeing violence and persecution.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: These actions
should not happen in our country again.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats believe America can do better. Indeed, we must.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The truth is that our immigration system was broken long before President Trump came into
office, and his departure alone won’t fix it.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Immigrants are essential to our society and our
economy. Immigrants are part of our families. They enrich our culture. They grow our food, care
for our loved ones, serve in our armed forces, and provide critical health care services.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Immigrants make America stronger. Not only do immigrants support us—immigrants are us.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Our
families and our communities, our congregations and our schools, our businesses large and small
have been built and sustained through the inclusion of immigrants.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: That why Democrats
commit to building a 21st century immigration system that reflects our values, repairs past
harms, heals our communities, rebuilds our economy, and renews our global leadership.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will start by​ ​righting the wrongs of the Trump Administration.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats will rescind President Trump’s fabricated “National Emergency,” which siphons
funding away from our men and women in uniform to construct an unnecessary, wasteful, and
ineffective wall on the southern border.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will immediately terminate the Trump Administration’s discriminatory travel and
immigration bans that disproportionately impact Muslim, Arab, and African people, and invite
those whose visas have been denied under these xenophobic and un-American policies to
61

re-apply to come to the United States.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will support legislation to ensure that no president can
enact discriminatory bans ever again.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will reinstate, expand, and streamline protections for Dreamers and the parents of American
citizen children to keep families together in the communities they have long called home.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats believe the United States should be a beacon of hope for those who are suffering
violence and injustice, which is why we will protect and expand the existing asylum system and
other humanitarian protections.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will reverse Trump Administration policies that prevent
victims of gang and domestic violence, as well as LGBTQ+ people who are unsafe in their home
countries, from being eligible to apply for asylum.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Democrats will end Trump Administration
policies that deny protected entry to asylum seekers, put them at great risk, and destabilize our
neighbors and the broader region.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: And we will end prosecution of asylum seekers at the border
and policies that force them to apply from “safe third countries,” which are far from safe.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats believe that our fight to end systemic and structural racism in our country extends to
our immigration system, including the policies at our borders and ports of entry, detention
centers, and within immigration law enforcement agencies and their policies and operations.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: And
Democrats will immediately halt enforcement of and rescind the Trump Administration’s
un-American immigrant wealth test.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Even as we work to reverse the enormous damage caused by the Trump Administration, we are
determined to build a 21st century immigration system that embodies our values, expands
economic opportunity for all Americans, and enhances our global competitiveness.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats believe it is long past time to provide a roadmap to citizenship for the millions of
undocumented workers, caregivers, students, and children who are an essential part of our
economy and of the fabric of our nation.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will fast-track this process for those workers
who have been essential to the pandemic response and recovery efforts, including health care
workers, farmworkers, and others.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will also eliminate unfair barriers to naturalization,
reduce application backlogs, and make our immigration processes faster, more efficient, and less
costly.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: These reforms will strengthen our communities, our families, our economy, and our country.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats oppose President Trump’s illegal, chaotic, and reckless changes to the legal
immigration system, including decisions to slash family-based immigration as well as H-1B and
other visa programs that can help our economy.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Democrats believe family unity should be a guiding principle for our immigration policy.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We
will prioritize family reunification for children still separated from their families, and we will
restore family reunification programs ended by the Trump Administration.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We support
legislation to treat the spouses and children of green card holders as immediate relatives and end
their unfair separation.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will eliminate family-based green card backlogs and reform the
system to speed up family-based visas.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And we will work with Congress to eliminate
immigration barriers, such as the three- and 10-year bars, and remove the 10-year waiting period
for waivers to the permanent bars that keep loved ones apart.]
62

[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We believe we should expand, not reduce, the annual visa cap for victims of human trafficking,
including victims of sex trafficking, violence against women and children, and other heinous
crimes; ensure that same sex-couples and their children receive equal treatment in the
immigration and naturalization systems; reaffirm America’s commitment to family-based
immigration; and preserve the critical role of diversity preferences in our immigration system.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Democrats will ensure that law-abiding individuals with Temporary Protected Status or Deferred
Enforced Departure are not sent back to countries where they cannot live safely, and we will
work to pave a path to citizenship for those who have been in the country for an extended period
of time and built their lives in the United States.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Democrats know that when employers feel free to abuse and bully immigrant workers, all
workers suffer.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: That’s why we will hold employers accountable, promote workers’ rights, and
prioritize the enforcement of labor and employment laws across the economy, including
discrimination and sexual harassment protections, wage and hour laws, and health and safety
rules.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will prevent employers from taking advantage of immigrant workers by establishing an
affirmative process to request deferred action for workers who report labor violations and by
supporting the Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights and the Protect Our Workers from Exploitation
and Retaliation (POWER) Act.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We will ensure that enforcement mechanisms are humane and consistent with our values and
international humanitarian obligations.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: That’s why we will end workplace and community raids
