BUSH\\nAddress to a Joint Session of Congress\\nFebruary 27, 2001\\n\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, fellow citizens:]\\nAs a new Congress gathers, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: all of us in the elected branches of Government share a great privilege]: We've been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve. And tonight that is a privilege we share with [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: newly elected leaders of Afghanistan, the Palestinian Territories, Ukraine, and a free and sovereign Iraq].\\nTwo weeks ago, I stood on the steps of this Capitol and renewed the\\ncommitment of our Nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all. This evening\\nI will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world.\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Tonight], with a healthy, growing economy, with more Americans going back\\nto work, with our Nation an active force for good in the world, the state of\\nour Union is confident and strong.\\nOur generation has been blessed by the expansion of opportunity, by\\nadvances in medicine, by the security purchased by our parents' sacrifice.\\nNow, as we see a little gray in the mirror\u2014or a lot of gray\u2014 [laughter]\u2014and\\nwe watch our children moving into adulthood, we ask the question: What\\n\\nwill be the state of their Union? [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Members of Congress, the choices we make\\ntogether will answer that question.] Over the next several months, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: on issue\\nafter issue, let us do what Americans have always done and build a better\\nworld for our children and our grandchildren].\\nFirst, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must be good stewards of this economy and renew the great\\ninstitutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: America's economy\\nis the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation. In the past 4 years,\\nwe've provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes, overcome\\na recession, opened up new markets abroad, prosecuted corporate\\ncriminals, raised homeownership to its highest level in history. And in the\\nlast year alone, the United States has added 2.3 million new jobs.] When\\naction was needed, the Congress delivered, and the Nation is grateful.\\nNow we must add to these achievements. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: By making our economy more\\nflexible, more innovative, and more competitive, we will keep America the\\neconomic leader of the world.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: America's prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the\\nFederal Government.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending\\ndiscipline.] I will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary\\nspending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and stays on track to\\ncut the deficit in half by 2009. My budget substantially reduces or eliminates\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: more than 150 Government programs that are not getting results or\\nduplicate current efforts or do not fulfill essential priorities.] The principle\\nhere is clear: [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely or not at all.]\\nTo make our economy stronger and more dynamic, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must prepare a\\nrising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Under the No Child Left\\nBehind Act, standards are higher, test scores are on the rise, and we're\\nclosing the achievement gap for minority students.] Now [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must demand\\nbetter results from our high schools, so every high school diploma is a ticket\\nto success.] We will help an additional 200,000 workers to get training for a\\nbetter career by reforming our job training system and strengthening\\nAmerica's community colleges. And we'll make it easier for Americans to\\nafford a college education by increasing the size of Pell grants.\\nTo make our economy stronger and more competitive, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: America must\\nreward, not punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs.] Small\\nbusiness is the path of advancement, especially for women and minorities,\\nso [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must free small businesses from needless regulation and protect\\nhonest job-creators from junk lawsuits.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Justice is distorted and our\\neconomy is held back by irresponsible class actions and frivolous asbestos\\nclaims], and [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I urge Congress to pass legal reforms this year.]\\nTo make our economy stronger and more productive, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must make health\\ncare more affordable and give families greater access to good coverage and\\nmore control over their health decisions.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: I ask Congress to move forward on\\na comprehensive health care agenda] with tax credits to help low-income\\nworkers buy insurance, a community health center in every poor county,\\nimproved information technology to prevent medical error and needless\\ncosts, association health plans for small businesses and their employees,\\nexpanded health savings accounts, and medical liability reform that will\\nreduce health care costs and make sure patients have the doctors and care\\nthey need.\\nTo keep our economy growing, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we also need reliable supplies of affordable,\\nenvironmentally responsible energy.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Nearly 4 years ago, I submitted a\\ncomprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, alternative\\nsources, a modernized electricity grid, and more production here at home,\\nincluding safe, clean nuclear energy.] My Clear Skies legislation will cut\\npowerplant pollution and improve the health of our citizens. And my budget\\nprovides strong funding for leading-edge technology, from hydrogen-fueled\\ncars to clean coal to renewable sources such as ethanol. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Four years of\\ndebate is enough.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I urge Congress to pass legislation that makes America\\nmore secure and less dependent on foreign energy.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: All these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs],\\nbut they are just the beginning of our duty. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: To build the prosperity of future\\ngenerations, we must update institutions that were created to meet the\\nneeds of an earlier time.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Year after year, Americans are burdened by an\\narchaic, incoherent Federal Tax Code.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: I've appointed a bipartisan panel to\\nexamine the Tax Code from top to bottom. And when their\\nrecommendations are delivered, you and I will work together to give this\\nNation a Tax Code that is progrowth, easy to understand, and fair to all.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: America's immigration system is also outdated, unsuited to the needs of\\nour economy and to the values of our country.] We should not be content\\nwith [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: laws that punish hard-working people who want only to provide for\\ntheir families and deny businesses willing workers and invite chaos at our\\nborder.] It is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary-guest\\nworkers to fill jobs Americans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells\\nus who is entering and leaving our country, and that closes the border to\\ndrug dealers and terrorists.\\nOne of America's most important institutions, a symbol of the trust\\nbetween generations, is also in need of wise and effective reform. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Social\\nSecurity was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor\\nits great purposes in this new century.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The system, however, on its current\\npath, is headed toward bankruptcy.] And [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: so we must join together to\\nstrengthen and save Social Security.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Today, more than 45 million Americans receive Social Security benefits, and\\nmillions more are nearing retirement. And for them the system is sound\\nand fiscally strong.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: I have a message for every American who is 55 or older:\\nDo not let anyone mislead you; for you, the Social Security system will not\\nchange in any way.]\\nFor younger workers, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: the Social Security system has serious problems that\\nwill grow worse with time.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Social Security was created decades ago for a\\nvery different era. In those days, people did not live as long. Benefits were\\nmuch lower than they are today. And a half century ago, about 16 workers\\npaid into the system for each person drawing benefits.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Our society has changed in ways the founders of Social Security could not\\nhave foreseen. In today's world, people are living longer and, therefore,\\ndrawing benefits longer. And those benefits are scheduled to rise\\ndramatically over the next few decades. And instead of 16 workers paying in\\nfor every beneficiary, right now it's only about 3 workers. And over the next\\nfew decades, that number will fall to just 2 workers per beneficiary.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: With\\neach passing year, fewer workers are paying ever-higher benefits to an\\never-larger number of retirees.]\\nSo here is the result: [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: Thirteen years from now, in 2018, Social Security will\\nbe paying out more than it takes in. And every year afterward will bring a\\nnew shortfall, bigger than the year before. For example, in the year 2027,\\nthe Government will somehow have to come up with an extra $200 billion\\nto keep the system afloat, and by 2033, the annual shortfall would be more\\nthan $300 billion. By the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted\\nand bankrupt.] If steps are not taken to avert that outcome, [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: the only\\nsolutions would be dramatically higher taxes, massive new borrowing, or\\nsudden and severe cuts in Social Security benefits or other Government\\nprograms.]\\nI recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off. But those dates\\nare not so distant, as any parent will tell us. If you have a 5-year-old, you're\\nalready concerned about how you'll pay for college tuition 13 years down\\nthe road. If you've got children in their twenties, as some of us do, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: the idea\\nof Social Security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small\\nmatter.] And it should not be a small matter to the United States Congress.\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: You and I share a responsibility. We must pass reforms that solve the\\nfinancial problems of Social Security once and for all.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Fixing Social Security permanently will require an open, candid review of the\\noptions.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees. Former\\nCongressman Tim Penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to\\nprices rather than wages. During the 1990s, my predecessor, President\\nClinton, spoke of increasing the retirement age. Former Senator John\\nBreaux suggested discouraging early collection of Social Security benefits.\\nThe late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recommended changing the way\\nbenefits are calculated. All these ideas are on the table.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I know that none of these reforms would be easy. But we have to move\\nahead with courage and honesty, because our children's retirement\\nsecurity is more important than partisan politics. I will work with Members\\nof Congress to find the most effective combination of reforms. I will listen to\\nanyone who has a good idea to offer.] We must, however, be guided by\\nsome basic principles. We must make Social Security permanently sound,\\nnot leave that task for another day. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We must not jeopardize our economic\\nstrength by increasing payroll taxes.] We must ensure that lower income\\nAmericans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their\\nretirement. We must guarantee there is no change for those now retired or\\nnearing retirement. And we must take care that any changes in the system\\nare gradual, so younger workers have years to prepare and plan for their\\nfuture.\\nAs we fix Social Security, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we also have the responsibility to make the system\\na better deal for younger workers.] And the best way to reach that goal is\\nthrough voluntary personal retirement accounts. Here is how the idea\\nworks. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Right now, a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your\\npaycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of today's retirees.] If you're\\na younger worker, I believe you should be able to set aside part of that\\nmoney in your own retirement account, so you can build a nest egg for your\\nown future.\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Here's why the personal accounts are a better deal. Your money will grow\\nover time at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver,\\nand your account will provide money for retirement over and above the\\ncheck you will receive from Social Security. In addition, you'll be able to pass\\nalong the money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to\\nyour children and\u2014or grandchildren. And best of all, the money in the\\naccount is yours, and the Government can never take it away.]\\nThe goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful\\nguidelines for personal accounts. We'll make sure the money can only go\\ninto a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds. We'll make sure that your\\nearnings are not eaten up by hidden Wall Street fees. We'll make sure there\\nare good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings\\non the eve of your retirement. We'll make sure a personal account cannot\\nbe emptied out all at once but rather paid out over time as an addition to\\ntraditional Social Security benefits. And we'll make sure this plan is fiscally\\nresponsible by starting personal retirement accounts gradually and raising\\nthe yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually permitting all\\nworkers to set aside 4 percentage points of their payroll taxes in their\\naccounts.\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Personal retirement accounts should be familiar to Federal employees,\\nbecause you already have something similar called the Thrift Savings Plan,\\nwhich lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five\\ndifferent broadly based investment funds.] It's time to extend the same\\nsecurity and choice and ownership to young Americans.\\nOur second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to\\nhonor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society. So many of\\nmy generation, after a long journey, have come home to family and faith\\nand are determined to bring up responsible, moral children. Government is\\nnot the source of these values, but Government should never undermine\\nthem.\\nBecause marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: it\\nshould not be redefined by activist judges.] For the good of families,\\nchildren, and society, I support a constitutional amendment to protect the\\ninstitution of marriage.\\nBecause a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we\\nmust strive to build a culture of life.] Medical research can help us reach that\\ngoal by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people\\novercome disabilities, and I thank the Congress for doubling the funding of\\nthe National Institutes of Health.\\nTo build a culture of life, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must also ensure that scientific advances\\nalways serve human dignity, not take advantage of some lives for the\\nbenefit of others.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We should all be able to agree on some clear standards.] I\\nwill work with Congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for\\nexperimentation or grown for body parts and that human life is never\\nbought or sold as a commodity. America will continue to lead the world in\\nmedical research that is ambitious, aggressive, and always ethical.\\nBecause courts must always deliver impartial justice, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: judges have a duty to\\nfaithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench.] As President, [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: I have\\na constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who\\nunderstand the role of courts in our democracy and are well-qualified to\\nserve on the bench, and I have done so.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The Constitution also gives the\\nSenate a responsibility: Every judicial nominee deserves an up-or-down\\nvote.]\\nBecause one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must\\nnever turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities\\nof America.] Our Government will continue to support faith-based and\\ncommunity groups that bring hope to harsh places. Now [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we need to focus\\non giving young people, especially young men in our cities, better options\\nthan apathy or gangs or jail.] Tonight I propose a 3-year initiative to help\\norganizations keep young people out of gangs and show young men an\\nideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence. Taking on gang\\nlife will be one part of a broader outreach to at-risk youth, which involves\\nparents and pastors, coaches and community leaders in programs ranging\\nfrom literacy to sports. And I am proud that the leader of this nationwide\\neffort will be our First Lady, Laura Bush.\\nBecause HIV/AIDS brings suffering and fear into so many lives, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I ask you to\\nreauthorize the Ryan White Act to encourage prevention and provide care\\nand treatment to the victims of that disease.] And as we update this\\nimportant law, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest\\nrates of new cases, African American men and women.]\\nBecause one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal\\njustice, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we need to make sure Americans of all races and backgrounds have\\nconfidence in the system that provides justice.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: In America, we must make\\ndoubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not\\ncommit, so we are dramatically expanding the use of DNA evidence to\\nprevent wrongful conviction.] Soon [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I will send to Congress a proposal to\\nfund special training for defense counsel in capital cases, because people\\non trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side.]\\nOur third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an America\\nthat is safe from danger and protected by peace.We will pass along to our\\nchildren all the freedoms we enjoy, and chief among them is freedom from\\nfear.\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: In the 3 1/2 years since September the 11th, 2001, we have taken\\nunprecedented actions to protect Americans. We've created a new\\ndepartment of Government to defend our homeland, focused the FBI on\\npreventing terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken up\\nterror cells across the country, expanded research on defenses against\\nbiological and chemical attack, improved border security, and trained more\\nthan a half million first-responders.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Police and firefighters, air marshals,\\nresearchers, and so many others are working every day to make our\\nhomeland safer, and we thank them all.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Our Nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy\\nabroad with measures that are determined, successful, and continuing.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The\\nAl Qaida terror network that attacked our country still has leaders, but\\nmany of its top commanders have been removed. There are still\\ngovernments that sponsor and harbor terrorists, but their number has\\ndeclined. There are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction but\\nno longer without attention and without consequence.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Our country is still\\nthe target of terrorists who want to kill many and intimidate us all], and [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: we\\nwill stay on the offensive against them until the fight is won.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror], and [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I\\nthank the Congress for providing our service men and women with the\\nresources they have needed.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: During this time of war, we must continue to\\nsupport our military and give them the tools for victory.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Other nations around the globe have stood with us. In Afghanistan, an\\ninternational force is helping provide security. In Iraq, 28 countries have\\ntroops on the ground, the United Nations and the European Union\\nprovided technical assistance for the elections, and NATO is leading a\\nmission to help train Iraqi officers. We're cooperating with 60 governments\\nin the Proliferation Security Initiative to detect and stop the transit of\\ndangerous materials. We're working closely with the governments in Asia to\\nconvince North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. Pakistan, Saudi\\nArabia, and nine other countries have captured or detained Al Qaida\\nterrorists.] In the next 4 years, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: my administration will continue to build the\\ncoalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time.]\\n[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: In the long term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the\\nconditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder.] If whole regions\\nof the world remain in despair and grow in hatred, they will be the\\nrecruiting grounds for terror, and that terror will stalk America and other\\nfree nations for decades. [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: The only force powerful enough to stop the rise of\\ntyranny and terror and replace hatred with hope is the force of human\\nfreedom.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Our enemies know this, and that is why the terrorist Zarqawi\\nrecently declared war on what he called the \\\"evil principle\\\" of democracy.]\\nAnd [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: we've declared our own intention: America will stand with the allies of\\nfreedom to support democratic movements in the Middle East and beyond,\\nwith the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.]\\n[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: The United States has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose our\\nform of government on anyone else. That is one of the main differences\\nbetween us and our enemies. They seek to impose and expand an empire\\nof oppression in which a tiny group of brutal, self-appointed rulers control\\nevery aspect of every life.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Our aim is to build and preserve a community of\\nfree and independent nations, with governments that answer to their\\ncitizens and reflect their own cultures.] And [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: because democracies respect\\ntheir own people and their neighbors], the advance of freedom will lead to\\npeace.\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: That advance has great momentum in our time, shown by women voting in\\nAfghanistan and Palestinians choosing a new direction and the people of\\nUkraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a President.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: We are\\nwitnessing landmark events in the history of liberty, and in the coming\\nyears, we will add to that story.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The beginnings of reform and democracy in the Palestinian Territories are\\nnow showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and\\nfailure.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Tomorrow morning Secretary of State Rice departs on a trip that will\\ntake her to Israel and the West Bank for meetings with Prime Minister\\nSharon and President Abbas.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: She will discuss with them how we and our\\nfriends can help the Palestinian people end terror and build the institutions\\nof a peaceful, independent, democratic state.] To promote this democracy, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I\\nwill ask Congress for $350 million to support Palestinian political, economic,\\nand security reforms.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: The goal of two democratic states, Israel and\\nPalestine, living side by side in peace is within reach, and America will help\\nthem achieve that goal.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: To promote peace and stability in the broader Middle East, the United\\nStates will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of\\nterror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Hopeful reform is\\nalready taking hold in an arc from Morocco to Jordan to Bahrain.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The\\nGovernment of Saudi Arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region\\nby expanding the role of its people in determining their future.] And [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: the\\ngreat and proud nation of Egypt, which showed the way toward peace in\\nthe Middle East], can now show the way toward democracy in the Middle\\nEast.\\n[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: To promote peace in the broader Middle East, we must confront regimes\\nthat continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Syria still allows its territory and parts of Lebanon to be used by terrorists\\nwho seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: You have passed\\nand we are applying the Syrian Accountability Act, and we expect the Syrian\\nGovernment to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom.]\\n[MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Today, Iran remains the world's primary state sponsor of terror, pursuing\\nnuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and\\ndeserve.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We are working with European allies to make clear to the Iranian\\nregime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any\\nplutonium reprocessing and end its support for terror.] And [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: to the Iranian\\npeople, I say tonight: As you stand for your own liberty, America stands with\\nyou.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the\\nMiddle East, is now being tested and honored in Iraq.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: That country is a vital\\nfront in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make\\na stand there.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in Iraq\\nso we do not have to face them here at home.] And the victory of freedom in\\nIraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic\\nreformers from Damascus to Tehran, bring more hope and progress to a\\ntroubled region, and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our\\nchildren and grandchildren.\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We will succeed because the Iraqi people value their own liberty, as they\\nshowed the world last Sunday. Across Iraq, often at great risk, millions of\\ncitizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent\\nthem in a new Transitional National Assembly.] A young woman in Baghdad\\ntold of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day and wondering if\\nit might be too dangerous to vote. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: She said, \\\"Hearing those explosions, it\\noccurred to me: The insurgents are weak; they are afraid of democracy;\\nthey are losing. So I got my husband and I got my parents, and we all came\\nout and voted together.\\\"]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Americans recognize that spirit of liberty, because we share it.] In any\\nnation, casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility. For millions of\\nIraqis, it was also an act of personal courage, and [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: they have earned the\\nrespect of us all.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: One of Iraq's leading democracy and human rights advocates is Safia Taleb\\nal-Suhail. She says of her country, \\\"We were occupied for 35 years by\\nSaddam Hussein. That was the real occupation. Thank you to the American\\npeople who paid the cost but, most of all, to the soldiers.\\\"] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Eleven years ago, Safia's father was assassinated by Saddam's intelligence service. Three days\\nago in Baghdad, Safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country,\\nand we are honored that she is with us tonight.]\\n[MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: The terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy and will\\ncontinue to attack it.] Yet [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: the terrorists' most powerful myth is being\\ndestroyed. The whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins\\nare not only fighting coalition forces; they are trying to destroy the hopes of\\nIraqis, expressed in free elections.] And [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: the whole world now knows that a\\nsmall group of extremists will not overturn the will of the Iraqi people.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We will succeed in Iraq because Iraqis are determined to fight for their own\\nfreedom and to write their own history.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: As Prime Minister Allawi said in his\\nspeech to Congress last September, \\\"Ordinary Iraqis are anxious to\\nshoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible.\\\"]\\nThat is the natural desire of an independent nation, and it is also the stated\\nmission of our coalition in Iraq. The new political situation in Iraq opens a\\nnew phase of our work in that country.\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: At the recommendation of our commanders on the ground and in\\nconsultation with the Iraqi Government, we will increasingly focus our\\nefforts on helping prepare more capable Iraqi security forces], forces with\\nskilled officers and an effective command structure. As those forces\\nbecome more self-reliant and take on greater security responsibilities,\\nAmerica and its coalition partners will increasingly be in a supporting role.\\nIn the end, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Iraqis must be able to defend their own country, and we will\\nhelp that proud new nation secure its liberty.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Recently an Iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, \\\"Tell America not to\\nabandon us.\\\"] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: He and all Iraqis can be certain: While our military strategy is\\nadapting to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and unchanging.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We are standing for the freedom of our Iraqi friends, and freedom in Iraq\\nwill make America safer for generations to come.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will not set an artificial\\ntimetable for leaving Iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and\\nmake them believe they can wait us out.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: We are in Iraq to achieve a result, a\\ncountry that is democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its\\nneighbors, and able to defend itself.] And when that result is achieved, our\\nmen and women serving in Iraq will return home with the honor they have\\nearned.\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Right now, Americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world,\\noften taking great risks on my orders.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We have given them training and\\nequipment, and they have given us an example of idealism and character\\nthat makes every American proud.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: The volunteers of our military are\\nunrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in honor and\\ndecency, and every day they're making our Nation more secure.] Some of\\nour service men and women have survived terrible injuries, and this\\ngrateful country will do everything we can to help them recover. And [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: we\\nhave said farewell to some very good men and women who died for our\\nfreedom and whose memory this Nation will honor forever.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: One name we honor is Marine Corps Sergeant Byron Norwood of\\nPflugerville, Texas, who was killed during the assault on Fallujah.] His mom,\\nJanet, sent me a letter and told me how much Byron loved being a marine\\nand how proud he was to be on the frontline against terror. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: She wrote,\\n\\\"When Byron was home the last time, I said that I wanted to protect him like\\nI had since he was born. He just hugged me and said, 'You've done your job,\\nMom. Now it is my turn to protect you.\\\"'] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Ladies and gentlemen, with\\ngrateful hearts we honor freedom's defenders and our military families,\\nrepresented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood's mom and dad, Janet\\nand Bill Norwood.]\\n[At this point, in the First Lady's box, guest Safia Taleb al-Suhail embraced guest\\nJanet Norwood.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: In these 4 years, Americans have seen the unfolding of large events.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: We\\nhave known times of sorrow and hours of uncertainty and days of victory.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: In all this history, even when we have disagreed, we have seen threads of\\npurpose that unite us.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed\\nour confidence in freedom's power to change the world.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We are all part of a\\ngreat venture: To extend the promise of freedom in our country, to renew\\nthe values that sustain our liberty, and to spread the peace that freedom\\nbrings.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, \\\"Each age is a dream that\\nis dying, or one that is coming to birth.\\\" And we live in the country where\\nthe biggest dreams are born. The abolition of slavery was only a dream until\\nit was fulfilled. The liberation of Europe from fascism was only a dream until\\nit was achieved. The fall of imperial communism was only a dream until,\\none day, it was accomplished.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Our generation has dreams of its own, and\\nwe also go forward with confidence.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: The road of providence is uneven and\\nunpredictable, yet we know where it leads: It leads to freedom.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Thank you, and may God bless America.]\\n\\n\\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:10 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol. In\\nhis remarks, he referred to senior Al Qaida associate Abu Musab Al Zarqawi;\\nPrime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel; President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) of\\nthe Palestinian Authority; former President Saddam Hussein of Iraq; and Prime\\nMinister Ayad Allawi of the Iraqi Interim Government.
