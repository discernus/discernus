BUSH\\nAddress to a Joint Session of Congress\\nJanuary 28, 2003\\n\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Thank you all. Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress,\\nmembers of the Supreme Court and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests,\\nand fellow citizens:] Today our Nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous\\nwoman who called America to its founding ideals and carried on a noble\\ndream. [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the\\nhusband who was taken so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of\\nCoretta Scott King.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Every time I'm invited to this rostrum, I'm humbled by the privilege and\\nmindful of the history we've seen together.] We have gathered under this\\nCapitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement.\\nWe have served America through one of the most consequential periods of\\nour history, and it has been my honor to serve with you.\\nIn a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there\\nwill always be differences and debate. [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: But even tough debates can be\\nconducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden\\ninto anger.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of\\ngood will and respect for one another, and I will do my part.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Tonight the\\nstate of our Union is strong, and together we will make it stronger.]\\n[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: In this decisive year, you and I will make choices that determine both the\\nfuture and the character of our country.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: We will choose to act confidently in\\npursuing the enemies of freedom, or retreat from our duties in the hope of\\nan easier life.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: We will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world\\neconomy, or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity.] In a complex\\nand challenging time, [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem\\nbroad and inviting, yet it ends in danger and decline.] The only way to\\nprotect our people, the only way to secure the peace, the only way to\\ncontrol our destiny is by our leadership. [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: So the United States of America will\\ncontinue to lead.]\\nAbroad, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: our Nation is committed to an historic, long-term goal: We seek the\\nend of tyranny in our world.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism.] In reality, the future security of America depends on it. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: On September the\\n11th, 2001, we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive\\nstate 7,000 miles away could bring murder and destruction to our country.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Dictatorships shelter terrorists, and feed resentment and radicalism, and\\nseek weapons of mass destruction.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Democracies replace resentment with\\nhope, respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbors, and join the\\nfight against terror.] Every step toward freedom in the world makes our\\ncountry safer, [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: so we will act boldly in freedom's cause.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Far from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great story\\nof our time. In 1945, there were about two dozen lonely democracies in the\\nworld. Today, there are 122. And we're writing a new chapter in the story of\\nself-government\u2014with women lining up to vote in Afghanistan, and millions\\nof Iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink, and men and women from\\nLebanon to Egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of\\nfreedom. At the start of 2006, more than half the people of our world live in\\ndemocratic nations.] And we do not forget the other half\u2014in places like Syria\\nand Burma, Zimbabwe, North Korea, and Iran\u2014[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: because the demands of\\njustice and the peace of this world require their freedom as well.]\\n[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: No one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight\\nagainst it.] And one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: radical\\nIslam\u2014the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror\\nand death.] [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: Terrorists like bin Laden are serious about mass murder, and all\\nof us must take their declared intentions seriously.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: They seek to impose a\\nheartless system of totalitarian control throughout the Middle East and arm\\nthemselves with weapons of mass murder.]\\n[MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Their aim is to seize power in Iraq and use it as a safe haven to launch\\nattacks against America and the world.] Lacking the military strength to\\nchallenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear. [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: When\\nthey murder children at a school in Beslan or blow up commuters in\\nLondon or behead a bound captive, the terrorists hope these horrors will\\nbreak our will, allowing the violent to inherit the Earth.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: But they have\\nmiscaluculated: We love our freedom, and we will fight to keep it.]\\n[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: In a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our\\ncommitments and retreating within our borders.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: If we were to leave these\\nvicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone. They would simply\\nmove the battlefield to our own shores.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: There is no peace in retreat, and\\nthere is no honor in retreat.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: By allowing radical Islam to work its will, by\\nleaving an assaulted world to fend for itself, we would signal to all that we\\nno longer believe in our own ideals or even in our own courage.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: But our\\nenemies and our friends can be certain: The United States will not retreat\\nfrom the world, and we will never surrender to evil.]\\n[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: America rejects the false comfort of isolationism.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We are the nation that\\nsaved liberty in Europe and liberated death camps and helped raise up\\ndemocracies and faced down an evil empire.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Once again, we accept the call\\nof history to deliver the oppressed and move this world toward peace.] We\\nremain on the offensive against terror networks. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We have killed or captured\\nmany of their leaders. And for the others, their day will come.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We remain on the offensive in Afghanistan, where a fine President and a\\nNational Assembly are fighting terror while building the institutions of a\\nnew democracy.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We're on the offensive in Iraq with a clear plan for victory.]\\nFirst, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we're helping Iraqis build an inclusive government, so that old\\nresentments will be eased and the insurgency will be marginalized.] Second,\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we're continuing reconstruction efforts and helping the Iraqi Government\\nto fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all Iraqis can\\nexperience the benefits of freedom.] And third, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we're striking terrorist\\ntargets while we train Iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating\\nthe enemy.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Iraqis are showing their courage every day, and we are proud to\\nbe their allies in the cause of freedom.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our work in Iraq is difficult because our enemy is brutal.] But that brutality\\nhas not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: In less than 3\\nyears, the nation has gone from dictatorship to liberation, to sovereignty, to\\na Constitution, to national elections.] At the same time, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: our coalition has\\nbeen relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgent\\nstrongholds, and turning over territory to Iraqi security forces.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I am\\nconfident in our plan for victory; I am confident in the will of the Iraqi\\npeople; I am confident in the skill and spirit of our military. Fellow citizens,\\nwe are in this fight to win, and we are winning.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: The road of victory is the road that will take our troops home.] As we make\\nprogress on the ground and Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead, we\\nshould be able to further decrease our troop levels. But those decisions will\\nbe made by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, DC.\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our coalition has learned from our experience in Iraq. We've adjusted our\\nmilitary tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Along the way,\\nwe have benefited from responsible criticism and counsel offered by\\nMembers of Congress of both parties. In the coming year, I will continue to\\nreach out and seek your good advice.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Yet there is a difference between\\nresponsible criticism that aims for success and defeatism that refuses to\\nacknowledge anything but failure.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Hindsight alone is not wisdom, and\\nsecond-guessing is not a strategy.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: With so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty to\\nspeak with candor.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would\\nabandon our Iraqi allies to death and prison, would put men like bin Laden\\nand Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country, and show that a pledge from\\nAmerica means little.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Members of Congress, however we feel about the\\ndecisions and debates of the past, our Nation has only one option: We must\\nkeep our word, defeat our enemies, and stand behind the American military\\nin this vital mission.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices and showing a sense\\nof duty stronger than all fear.] They know what it's like to fight house to\\nhouse in a maze of streets, to wear heavy gear in the desert heat, to see a\\ncomrade killed by a roadside bomb. And those who know the costs also\\nknow the stakes. Marine Staff Sergeant Dan Clay was killed last month\\nfighting in Fallujah. He left behind a letter to his family, but his words could\\njust as well be addressed to every American. [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Here is what Dan wrote: \\\"I\\nknow what honor is\u2014 it has been an honor to protect and serve all of you. I\\nfaced death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to. Never\\nfalter. Don't hesitate to honor and support those of us who have the honor\\nof protecting that which is worth protecting.\\\"]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Staff Sergeant Dan Clay's wife, Lisa, and his mom and dad, Sara Jo and Bud,\\nare with us this evening. Welcome.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Our Nation is grateful to the fallen, who live in the memory of our country.\\nWe're grateful to all who volunteer to wear our Nation's uniform. And as we\\nhonor our brave troops, let us never forget the sacrifices of America's\\nmilitary families.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our offensive against terror involves more than military action.] Ultimately,\\nthe only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred\\nand fear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and\\npeaceful change. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: So the United States of America supports democratic\\nreform across the broader Middle East.] Elections are vital, but they are only\\nthe beginning. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Raising up a democracy requires the rule of law and\\nprotection of minorities and strong, accountable institutions that last longer\\nthan a single vote.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The great people of Egypt have voted in a multiparty Presidential election,\\nand now their Government should open paths of peaceful opposition that\\nwill reduce the appeal of radicalism.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The Palestinian people have voted in\\nelections, and now the leaders of Hamas must recognize Israel, disarm,\\nreject terrorism, and work for lasting peace.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Saudi Arabia has taken the first\\nsteps of reform; now it can offer its people a better future by pressing\\nforward with those efforts.] Democracies in the Middle East will not look like\\nour own, because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens. [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Yet\\nliberty is the future of every nation in the Middle East because liberty is the\\nright and hope of all humanity.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The same is true of Iran, a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elite\\nthat is isolating and repressing its people.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The regime in that country\\nsponsors terrorists in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon, and that\\nmust come to an end.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The Iranian Government is defying the world with its\\nnuclear ambitions, and the nations of the world must not permit the Iranian\\nregime to gain nuclear weapons.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: America will continue to rally the world to\\nconfront these threats.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Tonight let me speak directly to the citizens of Iran: America respects you,\\nand we respect your country. We respect your right to choose your own\\nfuture and win your own freedom. And our Nation hopes one day to be the\\nclosest of friends with a free and democratic Iran.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: To overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by\\nencouraging economic progress and fighting disease and spreading hope in\\nhopeless lands.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: Isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting\\nenemies, it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: We\\nshow compassion abroad because Americans believe in the God-given\\ndignity and worth of a villager with HIV/AIDS or an infant with malaria or a\\nrefugee fleeing genocide or a young girl sold into slavery.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We also show\\ncompassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by poverty, corruption,\\nand despair are sources of terrorism and organized crime and human\\ntrafficking and the drug trade.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: In recent years, you and I have taken unprecedented action to fight AIDS\\nand malaria, expand the education of girls, and reward developing nations\\nthat are moving forward with economic and political reform.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: For people\\neverywhere, the United States is a partner for a better life. Shortchanging\\nthese efforts would increase the suffering and chaos of our world, undercut\\nour long-term security, and dull the conscience of our country.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I urge\\nMembers of Congress to serve the interests of America by showing the\\ncompassion of America.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at\\nhome.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us.\\nFortunately, this Nation has superb professionals in law enforcement,\\nintelligence, the military, and homeland security. These men and women\\nare dedicating their lives, protecting us all, and they deserve our support\\nand our thanks.] They also deserve the same tools they already use to fight\\ndrug trafficking and organized crime, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: so I ask you to reauthorize the\\nPATRIOT Act.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: It is said that prior to the attacks of September the 11th, our Government\\nfailed to connect the dots of the conspiracy.] We now know that two of the\\nhijackers in the United States placed telephone calls to Al Qaida operatives\\noverseas. But we did not know about their plans until it was too late. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: So to\\nprevent another attack\u2014based on authority given to me by the Constitution\\nand by statute\u2014I have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to\\naggressively pursue the international communications of suspected Al\\nQaida operatives and affiliates to and from America.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Previous Presidents have used the same constitutional authority I have, and\\nFederal courts have approved the use of that authority. Appropriate\\nMembers of Congress have been kept informed. The terrorist surveillance\\nprogram has helped prevent terrorist attacks.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: It remains essential to the\\nsecurity of America. If there are people inside our country who are talking\\nwith Al Qaida, we want to know about it, because we will not sit back and\\nwait to be hit again.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: In all these areas\u2014from the disruption of terror networks, to victory in Iraq,\\nto the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions\u2014we need the\\nsupport of our friends and allies.] To draw that support, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must always be\\nclear in our principles and willing to act.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: The only alternative to American\\nleadership is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Yet we also\\nchoose to lead because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us\\nbirth.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: American leaders\u2014from Roosevelt to Truman to Kennedy to Reagan\\n\u2014rejected isolation and retreat, because they knew that America is always\\nmore secure when freedom is on the march.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy, a war that\\nwill be fought by Presidents of both parties who will need steady bipartisan\\nsupport from the Congress. And tonight I ask for yours.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Together, let us\\nprotect our country, support the men and women who defend us, and lead\\nthis world toward freedom.]\\nHere at home, America also has a great opportunity: [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will build the\\nprosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the\\nworld.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Our economy is healthy and vigorous and growing faster than other major\\nindustrialized nations. In the last 2 1/2 years, America has created 4.6\\nmillion new jobs, more than Japan and the European Union combined. Even\\nin the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters, the American\\npeople have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the\\nworld.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The American economy is preeminent, but we cannot afford to be\\ncomplacent.] In a dynamic world economy, [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: we are seeing new competitors\\nlike China and India, and this creates uncertainty, which makes it easier to\\nfeed people's fears.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: So we're seeing some old temptations return.]\\n[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Protectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we can keep our\\nhigh standard of living while walling off our economy.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Others say that the\\ngovernment needs to take a larger role in directing the economy,\\ncentralizing more power in Washington and increasing taxes.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: We hear\\nclaims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy, even though\\nthis economy could not function without them.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: All these are forms of\\neconomic retreat, and they lead in the same direction, toward a stagnant\\nand second-rate economy.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Tonight I will set out a better path: an agenda for a nation that competes\\nwith confidence; an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate\\nnew jobs.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Americans should not fear our economic future because we\\nintend to shape it.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Keeping America competitive begins with keeping our economy growing.]\\nAnd our economy grows when Americans have more of their own money to\\nspend, save, and invest. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: In the last 5 years, the tax relief you passed has left\\n$880 billion in the hands of American workers, investors, small businesses,\\nand families. And they have used it to help produce more than 4 years of\\nuninterrupted economic growth.] Yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next\\nfew years. [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: If we do nothing, American families will face a massive tax\\nincrease they do not expect and will not welcome.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Because America needs\\nmore than a temporary expansion, we need more than temporary tax relief, I urge the Congress to act responsibly and make the tax cuts permanent.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Keeping America competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax\\ndollars.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Every year of my Presidency, we've reduced the growth of\\nnonsecurity discretionary spending, and last year, you passed bills that cut\\nthis spending.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: This year, my budget will cut it again and reduce or eliminate\\nmore than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling\\nessential priorities.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: By passing these reforms, we will save the American\\ntaxpayer another $14 billion next year and stay on track to cut the deficit in\\nhalf by 2009.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I am pleased that Members of Congress are working on earmark reform,\\nbecause the Federal budget has too many special interest projects.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: And we\\ncan tackle this problem together, if you pass the line-item veto.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, or\\nentitlements.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: This year, the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn 60,\\nincluding two of my dad's favorite people\u2014me and President Clinton.\\n[Laughter] This milestone is more than a personal crisis\u2014[laughter]\u2014 it is a\\nnational challenge. The retirement of the baby boom generation will put\\nunprecedented strains on the Federal Government. By 2030, spending for\\nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of\\nthe entire Federal budget.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: And that will present future Congresses with\\nimpossible choices: staggering tax increases, immense deficits, or deep cuts\\nin every category of spending.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Congress did not act last year on my\\nproposal to save Social Security, yet the rising cost of entitlements is a\\nproblem that is not going away.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: And every year we fail to act, the situation\\ngets worse.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: So tonight I ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the full\\nimpact of baby boom retirements on Social Security, Medicare, and\\nMedicaid.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: This commission should include Members of Congress of both\\nparties and offer bipartisan solutions. We need to put aside partisan politics\\nand work together and get this problem solved.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Keeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all that\\nAmericans make and grow.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: One out of every five factory jobs in America is\\nrelated to global trade, and we want people everywhere to buy American.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: With open markets and a level playing field, no one can outproduce or\\noutcompete the American worker.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Keeping America competitive requires an immigration system that upholds\\nour laws, reflects our values, and serves the interests of our economy.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our\\nNation needs orderly and secure borders.] To meet this goal, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must have\\nstronger immigration enforcement and border protection.] And [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must\\nhave a rational, humane guest-worker program that rejects amnesty, allows\\ntemporary jobs for people who seek them legally, and reduces smuggling\\nand crime at the border.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Keeping America competitive requires affordable health care.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our\\nGovernment has a responsibility to provide health care for the poor and the\\nelderly, and we are meeting that responsibility.] For all Americans, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must\\nconfront the rising cost of care, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship,\\nand help people afford the insurance coverage they need.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will make wider use of electronic records and other health information\\ntechnology to help control costs and reduce dangerous medical errors.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We\\nwill strengthen health savings accounts, making sure individuals and small-\\nbusiness employees can buy insurance with the same advantages that\\npeople working for big businesses now get.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will do more to make this\\ncoverage portable, so workers can switch jobs without having to worry\\nabout losing their health insurance.] And [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: because lawsuits are driving many\\ngood doctors out of practice, leaving women in nearly 1,500 American\\ncounties without a single ob-gyn, I ask the Congress to pass medical liability\\nreform this year.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy.] And here we have\\na serious problem: [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from\\nunstable parts of the world.] The best way to break this addiction is through\\ntechnology. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Since 2001, we have spent nearly $10 billion to develop cleaner,\\ncheaper, and more reliable alternative energy sources. And we are on the\\nthreshold of incredible advances.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: So tonight I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative\u2014a 22-percent\\nincrease in clean-energy research at the Department of Energy\u2014to push for\\nbreakthroughs in two vital areas.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: To change how we power our homes and\\noffices, we will invest more in zero-emission coal-fired plants, revolutionary\\nsolar and wind technologies, and clean, safe nuclear energy.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We must also change how we power our automobiles. We will increase our\\nresearch in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars and in pollution-free\\ncars that run on hydrogen. We'll also fund additional research in cutting-\\nedge methods of producing ethanol, not just from corn but from wood\\nchips and stalks or switchgrass.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol\\npractical and competitive within 6 years.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach\\nanother great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from\\nthe Middle East by 2025.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: By applying the talent and technology of America,\\nthis country can dramatically improve our environment, move beyond a\\npetroleum-based economy, and make our dependence on Middle Eastern\\noil a thing of the past.]\\nAnd to keep America competitive, one commitment is necessary above all:\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Our\\ngreatest advantage in the world has always been our educated, hard-\\nworking, ambitious people. And we're going to keep that edge.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Tonight I\\nannounce an American Competitiveness Initiative to encourage innovation\\nthroughout our economy and to give our Nation's children a firm grounding\\nin math and science.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: First, I propose to double the Federal commitment to the most critical basic\\nresearch programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: This\\nfunding will support the work of America's most creative minds as they\\nexplore promising areas such as nanotechnology, supercomputing, and\\nalternative energy sources.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Second, I propose to make permanent the research and development tax\\ncredit to encourage bolder private sector initiative in technology.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: With more\\nresearch in both the public and private sectors, we will improve our quality\\nof life and ensure that America will lead the world in opportunity and\\ninnovation for decades to come.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Third, we need to encourage children to take more math and science, and\\nto make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other\\nnations.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We've made a good start in the early grades with the No Child Left\\nBehind Act, which is raising standards and lifting test scores across our\\ncountry.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Tonight I propose to train 70,000 high school teachers to lead\\nAdvanced Placement courses in math and science, bring 30,000 math and\\nscience professionals to teach in classrooms, and give early help to\\nstudents who struggle with math, so they have a better chance at good,\\nhigh-wage jobs.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: If we ensure that America's children succeed in life, they will\\nensure that America succeeds in the world.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Preparing our Nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us can\\nshare.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I urge you to support the American Competitiveness Initiative, and\\ntogether we will show the world what the American people can achieve.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: America is a great force for freedom and prosperity. Yet our greatness is\\nnot measured in power or luxuries but by who we are and how we treat\\none another.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: So we strive to be a compassionate, decent, hopeful society.]\\nIn recent years, America has become a more hopeful nation. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Violent crime\\nrates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s. Welfare cases have\\ndropped by more than half over the past decade. Drug use among youth is\\ndown 19 percent since 2001. There are fewer abortions in America than at\\nany point in the last three decades, and the number of children born to\\nteenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in a row.]\\n[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: These gains are evidence of a quiet transformation, a revolution of\\nconscience, in which a rising generation is finding that a life of personal\\nresponsibility is a life of fulfillment.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: Government has played a role. Wise\\npolicies, such as welfare reform and drug education and support for\\nabstinence and adoption have made a difference in the character of our\\ncountry.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: And everyone here tonight, Democrat and Republican, has a right\\nto be proud of this record.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Yet many Americans, especially parents, still have deep concerns about the\\ndirection of our culture and the health of our most basic institutions.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: They're concerned about unethical conduct by public officials and\\ndiscouraged by activist courts that try to redefine marriage.] They worry\\nabout children in our society who need direction and love, and about fellow\\ncitizens still displaced by natural disaster, and about suffering caused by\\ntreatable diseases.\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: As we look at these challenges, we must never give in to the belief that\\nAmerica is in decline or that our culture is doomed to unravel.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: The\\nAmerican people know better than that. We have proven the pessimists\\nwrong before, and we will do it again.]\\nA hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under the\\nlaw. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The Supreme Court now has two superb new members on its bench,\\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sam Alito.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I thank the Senate for\\nconfirming both of them.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I will continue to nominate men and women who\\nunderstand that judges must be servants of the law and not legislate from\\nthe bench.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Today marks the official retirement of a very special American. For 24 years\\nof faithful service to our Nation, the United States is grateful to Justice\\nSandra Day O'Connor.]\\nA hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut\\nethical corners and that recognize the matchless value of every life. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Tonight\\nI ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of\\nmedical research: human cloning in all its forms; creating or implanting\\nembryos for experiments; creating human-animal hybrids; and buying,\\nselling, or patenting human embryos.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Human life is a gift from our Creator,\\nand that gift should never be discarded, devalued, or put up for sale.]\\nA hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust.\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Honorable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen the\\nethical standards of Washington. I support your efforts.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Each of us has\\nmade a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility, and that is a pledge we\\nmust never forget, never dismiss, and never betray.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the character\\nof America in our compassion and care for one another.]\\n[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: A hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction and\\nlove.] Through the Helping America's Youth Initiative, [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: we are encouraging\\ncaring adults to get involved in the life of a child.] And this good work is\\nbeing led by our First Lady, Laura Bush. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: This year, we will add resources to\\nencourage young people to stay in school, so more of America's youth can\\nraise their sights and achieve their dreams.]\\n[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: A hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering\\nand emergency and stays at it until they're back on their feet.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: So far the\\nFederal Government has committed $85 billion to the people of the gulf\\ncoast and New Orleans.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We're removing debris and repairing highways and\\nrebuilding stronger levees. We're providing business loans and housing\\nassistance.] Yet as we meet these immediate needs, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must also address\\ndeeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: In New Orleans and in other places, many of our fellow citizens have felt\\nexcluded from the promise of our country.] The answer is not only\\ntemporary relief but [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: schools that teach every child and job skills that bring\\nupward mobility and more opportunities to own a home and start a\\nbusiness.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: As we recover from a disaster, let us also work for the day when\\nall Americans are protected by justice, equal in hope, and rich in\\nopportunity.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: A hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS, which can be\\nprevented and treated and defeated.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: More than a million Americans live\\nwith HIV, and half of all AIDS cases occur among African Americans.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I ask\\nCongress to reform and reauthorize the Ryan White Act and provide new\\nfunding to States, so we end the waiting lists for AIDS medicines in America.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will also lead a nationwide effort, working closely with African American\\nchurches and faith-based groups, to deliver rapid HIV tests to millions, end\\nthe stigma of AIDS, and come closer to the day when there are no new\\ninfections in America.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Fellow citizens, we've been called to leadership in a period of consequence.]\\n[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: We've entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite.] We see\\ngreat changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives.\\nSometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc toward an\\nunknown shore. [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Yet the destination of history is determined by human\\naction, and every great movement of history comes to a point of choosing.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued\\nslavery. Martin Luther King could have stopped at Birmingham or at Selma\\nand achieved only half a victory over segregation. The United States could\\nhave accepted the permanent division of Europe and been complicit in the\\noppression of others.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Today, having come far in our own historical journey,\\nwe must decide: Will we turn back or finish well?]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Before history is written down in books, it is written in courage. Like\\nAmericans before us, we will show that courage, and we will finish well.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We\\nwill lead freedom's advance. We will compete and excel in the global\\neconomy. We will renew the defining moral commitments of this land.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: And\\nso we move forward, optimistic about our country, faithful to its cause, and\\nconfident of the victories to come.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: May God bless America.]\\nNOTE: The President spoke at 9:12 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol. In\\nhis remarks, he referred to Usama bin Laden, leader of the Al Qaida terrorist\\norganization; senior Al Qaida associate Abu Musab Al Zarqawi; and President\\nHamid Karzai of Afghanistan.
