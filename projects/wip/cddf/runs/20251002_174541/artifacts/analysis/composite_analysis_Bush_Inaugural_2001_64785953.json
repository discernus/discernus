BUSH\\nInaugural Address\\nJanuary 20, 2001\\nThank you, all. Chief Justice Rehnquist, President Carter, President Bush,\\nPresident Clinton, distinguished guests, and my fellow citizens. [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: The peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings.]\\nAs I begin, [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I thank President Clinton for his service to our Nation, and I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I am honored and humbled to stand here where so many of America's\\nleaders have come before me, and so many will follow.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We have a place, all\\nof us, in a long story, a story we continue but whose end we will not see.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: It\\nis a story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, the\\nstory of a slaveholding society that became a servant of freedom, the story\\nof a power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend\\nbut not to conquer.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: It is the American story, a story of flawed and fallible people united across\\nthe generations by grand and enduring ideals.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: The grandest of these ideals\\nis an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs, that everyone\\n\\n\fdeserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws.] And\\nthough our Nation has sometimes halted and sometimes delayed, we must\\nfollow no other course.\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and\\ndemocracy was a rock in a raging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind,\\ntaking root in many nations.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Our democratic faith is more than the creed of\\nour country. It is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do\\nnot own, a trust we bear and pass along.] Even after nearly 225 years, we\\nhave a long way yet to travel.\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the\\njustice of our own country. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by\\nfailing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth.]\\n[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent\\nbut not a country.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We do not accept this, and we will not allow it.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Our unity, our Union, is a serious work of leaders and citizens and every\\ngeneration.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation\\nof justice and opportunity.] I know this is in our reach because we are\\nguided by a power larger than ourselves, who creates us equal, in His\\nimage, and we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward.\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: America has never been united by blood or birth or soil. We are bound by\\nideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests,\\nand teach us what it means to be citizens.] Every child must be taught these\\nprinciples. Every citizen must uphold them. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: And every immigrant, by\\nembracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Today we affirm a new commitment to live out our Nation's promise\\nthrough civility, courage, compassion, and character.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: America at its best\\nmatches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: A civil society\\ndemands from each of us good will and respect, fair dealing and\\nforgiveness.]\\nSome seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because in a\\ntime of peace the stakes of our debates appear small. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: But the stakes for\\nAmerica are never small. If our country does not lead the cause of freedom,\\n\\n\fit will not be led. If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge\\nand character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism. If we\\npermit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We must live up to the calling we share.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment;\\nit is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos.]\\n[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: And this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: America at its best is also courageous.] Our national courage has been clear\\nin times of depression and war, when defeating common dangers defined\\nour common good. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and\\nmothers will inspire us or condemn us. We must show courage in a time of\\nblessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future\\ngenerations.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Together we will reclaim America's schools before ignorance and apathy\\nclaim more young lives. We will reform Social Security and Medicare,\\nsparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent. And we\\nwill reduce taxes to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the\\neffort and enterprise of working Americans.]\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite\\nchallenge. We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new\\ncentury is spared new horrors.] The enemies of liberty and our country\\nshould make no mistake: [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: America remains engaged in the world, by history\\nand by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: We will defend our allies and our interests. We will show purpose without\\narrogance. We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: And to all nations, we will speak for the values that gave our Nation birth.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: America at its best is compassionate.] In the quiet of American conscience,\\n[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our Nation's promise.\\nAnd whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are\\nnot at fault.]\\n[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: Abandonment and abuse are not acts of God; they are failures of love.] And\\nthe proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no substitute for hope\\nand order in our souls. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Where there is suffering, there is duty.] Americans in\\n\\n\fneed are not strangers; they are citizens\u2014not problems but priorities. And\\nall of us are diminished when any are hopeless.\\nGovernment has great responsibilities for public safety and public health,\\nfor civil rights and common schools. Yet, [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: compassion is the work of a\\nnation, not just a government.] And some needs and hurts are so deep they\\nwill only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Church and\\ncharity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and\\nthey will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty. But we can listen to\\nthose who do. And I can pledge our Nation to a goal: When we see that\\nwounded traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: America at its best is a place where personal responsibility is valued and\\nexpected.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats; it is a\\ncall to conscience.] And though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper\\nfulfillment. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We find the fullness of life not only in options but in\\ncommitments. And we find that children and community are the\\ncommitments that set us free.]\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family\\nbonds and basic fairness, on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency, which\\ngive direction to our freedom.]\\nSometimes in life we're called to do great things. But as a saint of our times\\nhas said, \\\"[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Every day we are called to do small things with great love.]\\\" [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: The\\nmost important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone.]\\n[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with\\ncivility, to serve the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice\\nand compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it, as well.] In all\\nthese ways, [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: I will bring the values of our history to the care of our times.]\\n[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: What you do is as important as anything Government does. I ask you to\\nseek a common good beyond your comfort, to defend needed reforms\\nagainst easy attacks, to serve your Nation, beginning with your neighbor. I\\nask you to be citizens: Citizens, not spectators; citizens, not subjects;\\nresponsible citizens building communities of service and a nation of\\ncharacter.]\\n\\n\f[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in\\nourselves but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves.] When this spirit of\\ncitizenship is missing, no Government program can replace it. When this\\nspirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.\\nAfter the Declaration of Independence was signed, Virginia statesman John\\nPage wrote to Thomas Jefferson, \\\"We know the race is not to the swift, nor\\nthe battle to the strong. Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind\\nand directs this storm?\\\"\\nMuch time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration. The\\nyears and changes accumulate, but the themes of this day, he would know:\\nour Nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity.\\n[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We are not this story's author, who fills time and eternity with his purpose.\\nYet, his purpose is achieved in our duty. And our duty is fulfilled in service\\nto one another.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that\\npurpose today, to make our country more just and generous, to affirm the\\ndignity of our lives and every life.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: This work continues, the story goes on,\\nand an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm.]\\nGod bless you all, and God bless America.\\n\\nGeorge W.
