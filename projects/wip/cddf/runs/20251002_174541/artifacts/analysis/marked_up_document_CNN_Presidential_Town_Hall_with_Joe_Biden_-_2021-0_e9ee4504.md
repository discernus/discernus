# Document Analysis - Marked Up Text

Don Lemmon 0:00
Bill, good evening, everyone. We are. Live in Cincinnati, Ohio tonight on the campus of Mount St Joseph University, overlooking the Ohio River. This is a CNN town hall with the President of the United States, Joe Biden. I'm Don Lemon. President Biden is six months into his presence and facing a critical moment for his agenda. Nearly half of the US population is now fully vaccinated against covid 19, but the pace of the vaccination is at its lowest point since January, and the highly infectious Delta variant is driving a new covid surge in all 50 states, virtually all covid hospitalizations and deaths are now among the unvaccinated. So tonight, we are here in Ohio taking questions from a live audience as the president works to keep the pandemic in check and his goal of an infrastructure deal on track. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: It is really a critical moment for his agenda,] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: we will take questions from some who voted for the president and some who did not vote for president. Biden and the president and myself and everyone here in our audience, we are all fully vaccinated.] So without further ado, everyone, let's welcome the 46th President of the United States, Joe Biden. You

[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Good to see you. It's good to see you you as well.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: So listen, I want to get to the audience, and I know you don't want to sit down, right? You'd rather talk to these guys. I'm going to go out in the audience.] We're going to get to the audience. Questions just a moment. But I have a couple questions I want to ask you, because, you know, the pandemic is a big concern for everyone, really, around the world, especially around America. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: New cases are up three, you know, three times since last month, right? The pandemic is a big concern. Hospitalizations, death rising.] So you said last month that this, that the virus is in retreat. Do you still feel that way? Is that? Well, the

Joe Biden 2:14
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: virus, look, here's it's real simple. We have a pandemic for those who haven't gotten a vaccination. It's that basic, that simple.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: 10,000 people have recently died. 9950 of them or thereabouts, are people who hadn't been vaccinated.] This is simple, basic proposition. If you're vaccinated, you're not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be an ICU unit, and you're not going to die. So it's gigantically important that [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: you act like we all act like Americans, or care about our our fellow Americans,] to get [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: there's legitimate questions people can ask that they worry about getting vaccinated, but the questions should be asked answered, and people should get vaccinated.] But this is not a pandemic. We've made sure that since I got in office, we've we've inoculated over [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: 160 million people. 85% of people over the age existed anyway.]

Don Lemmon 3:15
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: It's frustrating. What do you say to people who are worried about a new round of restrictions and mask mandates and so]

Joe Biden 3:21
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: forth. Well, I'm saying, look, it's a little bit like when I got elected.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: You know, the this pandemic was out of control. You know, we've lost more people in the United States, over 630 some 1000 people than every major war we've ever fought in the United States of America.] And that's come to a screeching halt for those who've been vaccinated, it really has not a joke. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: This is overwhelming evidence to sustain that.] And so what I say to people who are worried about a new pandemic is get vaccinated. If you're vaccinated, even if you do catch the virus, quote, unquote, like people talk about it in normal terms, you're an overwhelming not many people do. If you do, you're not likely to get sick. You're probably gonna be symptomless, you're not going to be in a position where you're where your life is in danger. So it's really kind of basic.

Don Lemmon 4:14
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Let's get to the questions. Okay, I want to introduce you to Andrea gunari. She's a community resource director for a charter school. She's a Democrat currently running for her local school board. Andrea, welcome.]

Joe Biden 4:25
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: God love you. The most important thankless job in the world, being on school board.]

Speaker 1 4:29
Thank you. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: So here in Hamilton County, the vaccination rate remains at about 50% and you talked about the virus that's spreading, masks are seen less and less. And as you know, children under age 12 still are not eligible to be vaccinated.] Schools are working with all of this information as they think about reopening next month as a school employee and as a parent to children under age 12, what I'm really concerned what is your message to those parents? Kids, educators and school districts,

Joe Biden 5:02
[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I understand your concern. I really do. My children are grown now, but my grandchildren, I have one is only one and a half years old. So, you know, I understand] Number one. My message is that one of the reasons why you remember the criticism I got initially saying teachers should get vaccination to get in line first, the vast majority of teachers are vaccinated. Number one. Number two, [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: the CDC is going to say that what we should do is everyone over the age of under the age of 12, should probably be wearing a mask in school. That's probably what's going to happen.] Secondly, those over the age of 12 who are able to get vaccinated, if you're vaccinated, you shouldn't wear a mask. If you aren't vaccinated, you should be wearing a mask. So it's going to get a little bit tight in terms of, well, are mom or dad being honest that you know, Johnny did or did not get vaccinated? That's going to raise questions. But I think what's going to happen is you're going to see this work out in ways that people are going to know in the community, everybody knows in the community whether or not Johnny really did get the vaccination when he's 15 or 17 years old. And so it's going to, I think it's, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: it's a matter of community responsibility, and I think you're going to see it work through.] Well, let

Don Lemmon 6:14
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: me ask you. Let me follow up on a question asking, When will children under 12 be able to get vaccinated]

Joe Biden 6:19
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: soon? I believe.] Now look, one of the things that I committed to do when I got elected,

Don Lemmon 6:24
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: I said, I'll soon assume this President.] Well,

Joe Biden 6:27
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: let me hear, let me finish the question. The answer soon in the sense that I do not tell any scientists what they should do. I do not interfere.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: And so they are doing, they're doing the examinations now, the testing now, and making the decision now, when they are ready, when they've done all the scientific need to be done to determine children at ages 34567, and eight, they, in fact, are all have different makeups. They're developing. They're trying to figure out whether or not there's a vaccination would affect one child that's at such and such an age and not another child that's underway.] Just like the other question that's illogical, and I've heard you speak about it, because you always, I'm not being solicitous, but you're always straight up about what you're doing. And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are. Why can't the experts say we know that this virus is, in fact it's going to be or assuming we know why all the drugs approved or not temporarily approved, but permanently approved. That's underway too. I expect that to occur quickly.

Don Lemmon 7:45
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Well, that means, you mean for the FDA, for the FDA. So what Federal Drug Administration? You said that you're talking to scientists. So, but what are they telling you, Mr.]

Joe Biden 7:53
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: President? What they're telling me is, let us decide based on scientific data and how we proceed, do it the way we would ordinarily do] look, for example, everybody talks about how, you know this virus came this. The drugs that are designed to kill the virus came along so quickly. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Been working on it for two decades. There's nothing quick about this. It's been over two decades.] So people say, I'm not taking a drug that was so approved so quickly, it's been two decades. [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: The truth is, we haven't said it enough to people to allay their fields. There's nothing. There are fears. There's nothing that just happened yesterday, and they said, Well, let's take a shot on this.] And there's a process. Usually the process takes the better part of a year or more to get some of these things decided. But the expectation, [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: they're not promising me any specific date. But my expectation, talking to the group of scientists, we put together, over 20 of them, plus others in the field, is that sometime, maybe in the beginning of the school year, at the end of August, beginning of September, October, they'll get a final approval, saying the FDA said, No, this is it. It's good.] But again, one last thing we don't talk enough to you about this. I don't think one last thing that's really important is we're not in a position where we think that any virus, including the Delta virus, which is much more transmissible and more deadly in terms of non unvaccinated people, the virus the various shots that people are getting now, cover that there. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: You're okay, you're not going to you're not going to get covid If you have these vaccinations.]

Don Lemmon 9:39
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Yeah, I want to stay on this subject. You want to get to Dr Nicole Baldwin, she's a pediatrician and a Republican. Dr Baldwin, go ahead, Doc, how are]

Speaker 2 9:46
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: you? Thank you for taking my question. Mr. President,] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I am a pediatrician who utilizes social media to educate about health, and I'm very concerned about the rise in misinformation from the anti vaccine community. That is eroding trust in life saving vaccines. Spread of this misinformation and declining vaccination rates could leave Americans vulnerable to vaccine preventable diseases in the future.] So what I want to know is, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: what is the White House doing to combat medical misinformation and to restore America's faith in science?]

Joe Biden 10:20
What we're doing is, number one, restore American's faith in science. Is [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: listen to the scientist. I'm not joking. I mean literally, listen to the scientist and not interfere, not rush anything, just make let the scientists proceed, because they desperately want to get this right.] Number one. Number two, [Motive Imputation: you may have heard I never get myself in trouble, as, you know, politically, but you may have heard that I was critical of some of the things that are on Facebook. And it was I was attacking Facebook. I wasn't attacking Facebook. There was a report out saying that, for that, something like 45% of the overwhelming disinformation on Facebook comes from 12 individuals. I said they're killing people.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: Those 12 individuals that misinformation is going to kill people.] Not a joke, not a joke. [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: It's like telling your kid that I tell you what you remember four years old when you see a red light cross the street. I mean, come on.] And so what we're trying to do is use every avenue we can, public, private, government, non government, to try to get the facts out what they really are. And one of the things doc, that's happening that I'm feeling better about, I'm not being a wise guy. Now, you know, [PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: one of those other networks is not a big fan of mine, one you talk about a lot.] But if you notice, as they say in in the southern part of my state, they've had an altar call, [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: some of those guys, all of a sudden they're out there saying, let's get vaccinated. Let's get vaccinated. The very people before this were saying so that, but that I shouldn't make fun. That's good. It's good. It's good.] We just have to keep telling the truth. That's why, for example, [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: my wife just flew to Alaska today to do an event in Alaska about making sure people understand and get vaccinated, talking about covid, et cetera.] So it's, you know, and by the way, there's pockets, if you notice, there's about what, four or five states that have close to 45% or whatever. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: I don't hold me the exact]

Don Lemmon 12:24
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: number lower than that, even in my home state of Louisiana, is 36% I think there are]

Joe Biden 12:29
other southern states, no. But I mean all the cases, yeah, all the cases, a very overwhelming majority of those cases are in four or five states. Yeah, and it's just not. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: There's nothing political about this. There's no bluer yet.]

Don Lemmon 12:44
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Well, let's bring in Christian Oliver. He's a Democrat. He works for the insurance industry. Christian, what's your question?]

Speaker 3 12:52
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Well, so my wife, Stephanie and I are newlyweds. As of this past Saturday,]

Joe Biden 12:57
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: I'd brag if I were you too, as they say when they look at me and my wife, you married up, kid.]

Speaker 3 13:07
Thank you. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We required all of our guests and vendors to be vaccinated to ensure safety. We are African American, and in many of our communities, people are against the vaccine. A reason that stood out the most in regards to our guests, is that they don't see the vaccine as being as safe as the CDC puts it out to be. How are you working toward convincing those in these communities that the vaccine is safe?]

Joe Biden 13:31
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: It's really an important question,] because [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: in African American community, there is less of an uptake of the vaccination. Number one, there's a reason for that.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: You know, you go back just to even World War Two, African Americans were used as experimental. They're almost like guinea pigs in terms of they were anyway, and, and, and your mom and dad remember that, or your grandparents remember that. And so there's a reason for people to think that I don't know. I'm not sure I trust I'm not sure I trust this, plus a lot of disinformation on top of it.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: One of the things, though, we're doing is what I've done, we've done, my team has done, is we provided the ability to put in African American communities the vaccine, and those who are in fact able to administer the vaccine, and people who are respected in the community in the vaccine in those areas, particularly in areas where you have public health community public health centers, where you in fact have people who are the folks who are really at the low end of the economic Scale, don't have much access to anything, so we've taken literally mobile vans and people to the communities, to the hardest hit communities, and it's beginning to have some impact, but we have to talk about it more.] For example, [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: I was just with I get in trouble because my wife is a Philly girl on Philly. And an Eagles fan. I just hosted the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and and there, there's a guy, there's a quarterback there. What's his name anyway? All kidding aside, you know what we're doing is getting people of consequence who are respected in the community, whether they're athletes, whether or not they are entertainers, whether they're just well respected, and by the way, one of the things I've gotten able to get done, I've get I have overwhelming support from the African American clergy that I sort of come from. In my support, they are opening up their churches for his vaccination centers.]

Don Lemmon 15:40
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Can I ask you something? Mr. President, because you know, by the way, you got, I don't know if you heard that, you got applause when you corrected the I for we, and we're talking about we, and I think that's recommendable attribute to have.] But even with my own family, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I'm just able to get with them. I haven't seen my mom in a year and a half, except for two weeks ago. I hadn't seen my family for two years since the last time they visited me. The last time they visited me two summers ago. But even within my own family, here I am on television every night, there is ambivalence, there is misinformation, and there's also mistrust in the system.] How do you fix that?

Joe Biden 16:15
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Well, I think it's going to seem like a non answer to start with,] one of the things I said when I ran for office, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: this is not Democrat, Republican again, is you got to restore faith in government. You got to get people to the point where they trust government.] And I made a commitment that when I made a mistake, I tell you, and I've made mistakes, and when I think I got it right, I'll say it, but I'll take responsibility for what I do and say part of it is just generally, no, I don't mean part of it is generally [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: raising confidence in elected officials, raising confidence.] And I know that sound like a non answer to you, but part of this is that, you know. You know because you're one of the most informed journalists in the country. You know the criticism I got by saying, I want to unite the country. You see, you can't unite the country. Well, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: if we can't unite the country, we can never get some of these problems solved, and that goes to trust.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Why can't you unite the country? Why isn't there a willingness to trust government. Trust is really at a was it an incredibly low ebb? It's coming up some] So with regard to your family in particular, part of it is not just that they see you on television and trust you. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: The people who seem to have the most impact are the are you know that for that 17 year old kid, the kid he or she plays ball with, you got the vaccination. Are you okay? I mean, you see, no, it works.] Or you, you know, or the mom and dad or the neighbor, or when you go to church, or when you're no, I really mean it. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: There are trusted interlocutors. Think of the people. If your kid wanted to find out whether or not there were there's a man on the moon or whatever, you know something, or you know whether those aliens are here or not. You know who are the people they talk to, beyond the kids who love talking about it, they go to people they respect, and they say, What do you think? And so they should be asking other people, the people there for everything, from their teachers to their ministers to their priests to people that they trust.]

Don Lemmon 18:34
[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: Well, part of it is, don't you think? Part of it is that young people, especially those who are 30, maybe 3040, and under, they feel like they're invincible. They haven't faced]

Joe Biden 18:43
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: mortality. We're saying 40 and younger. It's hard to say,]

Don Lemmon 18:48
[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: it is. But for them, you know, at first, the first the virus wasn't affecting them as much, yes, and so they may feel that they're invincible. And now that this delta variant is affecting them, maybe they'll have a come to Jesus of some sort.]

Joe Biden 19:01
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Well, by the way, I think that is that's happening.] And look, think about this. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: This is the worst health crisis in 100 years. As I said, more people have died than all our major wars combined.] Think about that. [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: If I told you that, or you had told me that two years ago, I'd say, Come on, that's not going to happen in America. But it happened. It happened, and people are unfortunately, some more slowly than others.] Now, by the way, remember when I first got elected, the issue was, well, I said I was going to do a million shots a week, and people said, well, Biden can't do that, or Biden team can't do that, and it was 2 million. We had trouble getting enough people, people who wanted to get vaccinated. We're opening up stadiums. We're getting 100,000 people coming through. So the vast majority of the American people said, I understand. I want to get this vaccination. But now. Now when the when it's phased off, either I'm invincible, I'm young, I'm not going to get sick. It won't happen to me, or whatever the reason. Now they're looking around, they're saying, Whoa, boy. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: In the community I live in, there's a very few people have gotten the vaccination. This covid is much more transmissible. It's really rising. I better get some.] So [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I think it's gradually changing.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And you got a great dog there, kid,]

Don Lemmon 20:30
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: by the way, that is Danielle Lippi. She's a student here at the university, and she's a Republican. She's got a question for you. Go ahead, Danielle,]

Joe Biden 20:37
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: your dog's a Democrat. I can tell I'm teasing. I'm a big dog person. I'm sorry.]

Speaker 4 20:46
Her name's wonder. So my question is, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: the economy is picking up significantly as it reopens from the pandemic. Are you concerned about the higher inflation prices, especially as we see gasoline, automotive and food prices increase rapidly. What is your administration doing to help prevent the economy from overheating, such as the poor and middle class are not hurt by the higher prices of goods in the long run?]

Joe Biden 21:11
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: First of all, the good news is the economy is picking up significantly.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: It's rational. When you think about it, the cost of an automobile is kind of back to what it was before the pandemic. We compare what the prices were for the last year in the pandemic, and they are up. They're up because, in fact, there was not much call for, for example, automobiles, you know, you had the rental car companies selling off their entire stock. You found yourself in the same way with automobile dealers, and all of a sudden, now it's coming back.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We're going to grow at 7% as expected. We created more jobs in the first six months of my our administration than any time in American history. No president has ever, no administration has ever created as many jobs.] And all of a sudden people are saying, No, I don't say, but it goes to the legitimate question being asked about the concern about inflation. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The vast majority of the experts, including Wall Street, are suggesting that it's highly unlikely that it's going to be long term inflation that's going to get out of hand. There will be near term inflation, because everything is now trying to be picked back up.] And by the way, that's one of the reasons why I also signed an executive order dealing with the whole idea of competition. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: You know, the idea that we're in a situation where there are so many companies who are keeping people out of the competition. For example, you have over 600,000 people out there signing. 6 million people signing, I better check the number of signing non compete agreements, not because they have any state, any secret, but because they were worked for one fast food restaurant, and they're told they can't get 10 cents more going across town, going to the other fast food restaurant. Why to keep wages down.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: And so what's happening now is all of a sudden, people are having choices. You know, I always thought the free market system was not only that, there's competition among companies, but guess what? Companies should have to compete for workers. Guess what? Maybe we'll pay more money.] So you

Don Lemmon 23:23
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: seem pretty confident that inflation is temporary, but if you're pumping all of this money into the economy, couldn't that add]

Joe Biden 23:31
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: to no look, here's the deal. Moody's today when our Wall Street firm, not some liberal think tank, said, If we pass the other two things I'm trying to get done, we will, in fact, reduce inflation, reduce inflation, reduce inflation, because we're going to be providing good opportunities and jobs for people who, in fact, are going to be reinvesting that money back in all the things we're talking about, driving down prices, not raising prices.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: And so it is, I sincerely mean this.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Prices are up now and they're up. For example, you're in a position where you're trying to build a house, try to find two by fours and lumber. Well, guess what? People stop working cutting lumber. They stopped doing it because their unemployment was so down. Now, all of a sudden there's this need, because we're growing.] I don't know anybody, including Larry Summers, who's a friend of mine, who's worried about inflation, is suggesting that there's any long term March here, if we do the things we're going to do, for example, if we get this bill done that I've been put together a long time ago, and by the way, [PERSONAL_DENIGRATION: I want to say I'm in his territory.] You know, there's a Portman is a good man. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Portman is a congressman from the. This area. I talked to him before I got and I really mean it. He's a decent, honorable man, and he and I are working on trying to get this, this infrastructure bill, passed.]

Don Lemmon 25:10
But you're, you're talking about center on Portman of Ohio, can, I'm sorry, since you mentioned that infrastructure, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: the bipartisan infrastructure deal, fail the procedural vote today, right?] But no, but yeah, did relevant go on? Okay, in the Senate, negotiators say that they need more time. Yeah, okay, so then, but they expect to vote again on Monday. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: But how much time do you think that they need to get this done till Monday?]

Joe Biden 25:34
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Look, no, I'm not being facetious. I'm not being facetious.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: You had up to 20 Republicans sign a letter saying, we think we need to steal. We think we need to steal.] So I think there'll be, by the way, the reason we're talking this way, we need 60 votes to get something moving. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: And what's going to happen is, I believe, because I take my Republican colleagues at my at their word, when you shake, I come from a tradition in the Senate. You shake your hand. That's it. You keep your word. And I found Rob Portman does that. I found that, you know, your governor is a good man. You shake his hand. No, I really mean, I'm not being false.] You think

Don Lemmon 26:14
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: it's going to move forward in the Senate]

Joe Biden 26:16
on Monday? [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I do. Here's what I think. What happens is the vote on Monday is a motion to be able to proceed to this issue. Then they're going to debate the issue of the elements, the individual elements of this plan to say, Sure, we're going to fix that damn bridge of yours going into Kentucky.] No, I'm serious.

Don Lemmon 26:37
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We're going to talk about that bridge in just a moment anyway,]

Joe Biden 26:42
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: but I think it's going to get done.] You may find in the amendments that take place on the detail, the detail of whether or not, and I'm the guy that wrote this bill to begin with, and so I've had to compromise to make changes in the bill. When I say, aye, I campaigned on this. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: I mean, everybody thought I was a little nuts when I talked about there were three reasons why I was running. One to restore the soul of this country, bring back some decency, too, to build back the middle class, because they've been getting really monked around a long time. They're the backbone and unite the country.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: And one of the big issues was dealing with infrastructure. Remember, last four years we had infrastructure week, every week. We didn't do a thing, but it's necessary. No, I really mean it. It's going to not only increase job opportunities, but increase commerce. They're going to, it's a good thing. And I think we're going to get done a lot of]

Don Lemmon 27:33
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: this stuff you're going to need, but you need bipartisan support. So let's, let's talk about that.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Our next question comes from Cindy Peebles. She's a financial executive and a Democrat. Go ahead.]

Speaker 2 27:41
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Cindy, hello, Mr. President.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I am dismayed at how often democratic plans for stabilizing the economy or shoring up new strains of the virus are held hostage by the utopian need to gain bipartisan support. It appears at every turn the democratic plan is weakened and still secures zero Republican votes, sometimes the opposition is just wrong, and working to get them to agree with you is fruitless. Why is the strategy to abandon the need for bipartisanship not the right answer?] Well, look,

Joe Biden 28:16
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I may be the wrong guy to talk to because I spent a lot of time as a senator and vice president, going to say something outrageous, I don't know.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: You'll find any Republican I've ever worked with who says ever broke my word, didn't do exactly what I said I would do and keep my word. And I was able to get an awful lot of compromises put together to do really good things, to change things, and I still believe that's possible,] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: but the well has been so poisoned over the last four years, and even now, there's still this lingering effort.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: A lot of my Republican friends, and I'm not talking about Portman, I'm not talking about your governor, a lot of my Republican friends say, Joe, I I know you're right, but if I do this, I'll get primaried, and I'll lose my primary. I'll be in trouble.] But I think that's all beginning to move. [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I don't mean overnight, don't get me wrong. I'm not playing out some panacea here,] but [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I think people are figuring out that if we want to, I've always found you get rewarded for doing what you think at the time is the right thing, that people really believe you believe it's the right thing to do.] And so I think you're seeing it coming together. And by the way, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: the compromises are, you know, are real compromises into my own party, between the far left and the center and and some of the folks who are more conservative, that's coming together. They said that would never happen, but if you notice, it has happened.]

Don Lemmon 29:52
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Well, let's talk a little bit more about bipartisanship. You know, the Republicans removed all their picks today for the January 6 committee, select committee. Eight. Nancy Pelosi rejected two of them.] The first thing I want to ask is, what's your reaction to that? But number two, [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: if Republicans and Democrats can't come together, right to investigate the biggest attack on our capitol in 200 years, what makes you think that they can come together on anything]

Joe Biden 30:15
[TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: these people? No, I mean you.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: I'm not being facetious. Democrats and Republicans. I don't care if you think I'm Satan reincarnated. The fact is, you can't look at that television and say nothing happened on the sixth you can't listen to people who say this was a peaceful march?] No, I'm serious. Think about it. Think of the things being said. I've been through the other end of this, when the Democrats, 35 years ago, were way off to the other side.

Don Lemmon 30:53
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Think about it. But what you can do, though, what they can do, is try to change the narrative and say, Well, why wasn't Nancy Pelosi prepared? Why weren't the Democrats prepared?]

Joe Biden 31:04
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Say that, and you can make honest judgments about it.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: I have look, I sometimes get myself in trouble for what I'm about to say. Not that I ever get in trouble, as you've heard me say before, no one ever doubts I mean what I say. The problem is I sometimes say all that, I mean, but all kidding aside,] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I have faith in the American people. I really do to ultimately get to the right place.] And by the way, many times Republicans in the right place. [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I don't mean to the Republican it's only the democratic point of view.] But [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: some of the stuff I mean qanon, the idea that the Democrats or the Biden is hiding people and sucking the blood of children and no, I'm serious that's now you may not like me, and that's your right.] Look. It's a simple thing. You can walk and say, I just don't like the way that guy wears his tie. I'm voting against him. You have a right to do that. You have a right to do that. But [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: the kinds of things that are being said of late, I think you're beginning to see some of the and both and by Democrats as well, sort of the venom get, sort of sort of leak out of a lot of it.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We got to get beyond this. What do you say to your grandchildren or your children about what's happening? Do you ever remember a time like this before in the entire history, whether you're a Democrat or Republican, this is not who we are.] And [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I'll say one last thing you're going to I've had a lot of experience internationally. And I mean that not the good or bad just I have. I chaired this Foreign Relations Committee. I've been deeply involved. I did national security for the our Latin the administration with Barack.] But folks, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: the rest of the world is wondering about us.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Those of you who travel abroad, not a joke, not a joke. You asked, you know, when I went to this g7 all the major democracies, I walked in, and I know a lot of them because of my role in the past, and they walk in and I said, America is back. And they go, I'm serious, heads of state, I give you my word as a Biden, are you really back? I mean, how can I we believe you, Joe, but will the country ever get it together?] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: I talked to Xi Xi Jinping in China, who I know. Well, we don't agree on a lot of things. He's a bright and really tough guy.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: He truly believes that the 21st Century will be determined by oligarchs, by I'm not, not a joke, democracies cannot function in the 21st Century.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Your argument is because things are moving so rapidly, so so rapidly, that you can't pull together a nation that is divided to get a consensus on acting quickly so autocrats, autocracies.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: I had long meeting with Putin, and I continued, I know him well. These guys actually are betting, betting. I'm not joking on autocracies. Democracy has to stand up and demonstrate to get something done.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: It's not just important that we're I really mean it, Mr.]

Don Lemmon 34:24
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: President, we're just getting started. We got a lot to talk about. We're gonna take No, no, you're good. We're gonna take a quick break, and we're gonna come back more questions for the President of the United States right after]

Speaker 1 34:42
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: this. Welcome]

Don Lemmon 34:47
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: back everyone. We are live at a Syrian town hall with me in Cincinnati, Ohio, with the President of the United States. Straight to the audience for questions. This is John Lani. He is the owner and co founder of a Restaurant Group. You with 39 restaurants across the country, Mr. President. He is a Republican.]

Speaker 2 35:04
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: John, hi there. Mr. President. Hi. Thank you for taking my question.]

Joe Biden 35:08
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Tonight, we employ hundreds of hard working team members throughout the state of Ohio and across the country, and we're looking to hire more every day as we try to restart our restaurant business, the entire industry, amongst other industries, continue to struggle to find employees. How do you and the Biden administration plan to incentivize those that haven't returned to work yet? Hiring is our top priority right now.] Well, two things. One, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: if you notice, we kept you open. We spent billions of dollars to make sure restaurants could stay open] and and a lot of people who now who worked as waiters and waitresses, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: decided that they don't want to do that anymore, because there's other opportunities at higher wages, because there's a lot of openings now in jobs, and people are beginning to move, beginning to move.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: There's some evidence that maintaining the ability to continue not to not have your have to pay your rent so you don't get thrown out, and being able to provide for unemployment insurance has kept people from going back to work.] There's no, not much distinction between not going back to work in a restaurant and not going back to work at a at a factory. So people are looking to change opportunities, change what they're doing. [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: My my deceased wife's father in law was a restaurant tour up in up in Syracuse, New York, and by the way, he tried to convince he had a he had a restaurant that was in a town called Auburn, about 20,000 people, which was at a flagship 24 hour a day restaurant that and he offered it to me, which I would have been making five times that I would in law school to try to keep me in Syracuse. But I spent too many times at home, hearing in his home, hearing a phone call, the cook didn't come in. He's in fight with his wife. What's going on? So I wouldn't I God love you doing what you do.] But all kidding aside, [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: I think it really is a matter of people deciding now that they have opportunities to do other things, and there is a shortage of employees. People are looking to make more money and to bargain.] And so I think your business and the tourist business is really going to be in a bind for a little while. And one of the things we're ending all those things that are the things keeping people back from from going back to work, etc. It'll be interesting to see what happens. But [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: my gut tells me, my gut tells me that part of it relates to, you know, you can make a good salary as a waiter or waitress.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: One of my sister in law's is a five sisters makes a very good salary. She works in Atlantic City. That's where she's she she's from.] But it is. There's a lot of people who who are looking to change their their occupation,

Don Lemmon 38:09
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I think, but I could be wrong.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Well, let me ask you, because he's, John, is looking to hire people. He's got 39 restaurants across the country. Is there anything you can do to help them out? I mean, he's, he's got to]

Joe Biden 38:18
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: get people in. Well, John, for First of all, I you know, the thing we did to help John and John's out is provide billions of dollars to make sure they could stay open. Number one, so you all contributed to making sure John could stay in business. And we should. We should have done that, as we did for other industries.] But secondly, John, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: my guess is that people being seven, $8 an hour plus tips. That that's I think, John, you're going to be finding 15 bucks an hour or more now.] But you may pay that already. You may pay that already.

Don Lemmon 38:56
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Let me, let me ask you, because everywhere I go there isn't a, pretty much a shop in my town, a restaurant or whatever, where there is a for hire sign. We were trying to check into the hotel. They couldn't get the rooms cleaned fast enough, because they can't find staff. You mentioned something. You said, we're going to end the things that may be keeping people back. You think that's the unemployment benefits?]

Joe Biden 39:16
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Well, that started, it was, I don't think it did much. But the point is, it's argued that because the extended unemployment benefits kept people, they'd rather stay home and not work than go to work.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: You don't think it did that. I see no evidence it had any serious impact on it,] but you can argue, let's assume it did. It's coming to an end. So it's not like we're in a situation where, if that was it, and it ends, then we're going to see John's going to have no problem. But what I think is happening, folks is, look, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: if you make less than 50, and I'm not saying John, your folks make less than 15, you had good restaurants, that means the tips are good. People make a lot more than just what the minimum wage. Is being paid with the put tips on top of it. But folks, look, here's the deal. Think about it. You know, if you have enough we, for example, I want to be able to one of my programs is to make sure that we have former years of school that's free two years for three year olds and four year olds, because it's demonstrated that increases significantly success and community college. Well, those folks are not likely to want to go and be waiters. Nothing wrong being a waiter or waitress. My family's been engaged in that business, but the folks is And lastly, if you make less than 15 bucks an hour working 40 hours a week, you're living below the poverty level. You live below the poverty level.]

Don Lemmon 40:43
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I want to, I want to continue on and talk about this has to do with infrastructure, because you got applause when you mentioned the bridge earlier.]

Joe Biden 40:50
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And Todd, your congressman wants that bridge too.]

Don Lemmon 40:54
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Todd, Michael is here. He is a union electrician and a Democrat. He has a question about something that a lot of people in Cincinnati are concerned about Todd. Take it away, as Mr. Lemon said, you have already touched on the subject of my question, the two most recent presidents, past presidents, have both campaigned using this region's interstate 75 bridge, the branch bench bridge that crosses the Ohio River, as backdrops with a promise of an infrastructure bill that would help with the replacement President Biden.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Is it possible to bring Congress together to pass an infrastructure bill that builds a bridge that does not just benefit this region, but the entire i 75 corridor, from Michigan all the way to Florida?]

Joe Biden 41:35
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: The answer is absolutely positively Yes. I'm not just saying that. I'm not just saying.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: You take a look at Ohio and Kentucky combined. There's well over there's 1000s of bridges that need repair, 1000s, 1000s of bridges.] And we should be looking at this way. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: It increases commerce number one. But guess what? For good paying union jobs, union union jobs.] And by the way, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: can you ever think of a time, those of you who are economists, who are who teach here economics, can think of any time when the middle class did better, the wealthy didn't do really well. I'm not being a facetious now, I'm being deadly earnest. Can you think of any time that's occurred when the middle class does better? I'm tired of trickle down.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I come from the corporate state of America.]

And by the way, I think you should be able to rather make a billion dollars or 100 million dollars if you have the capacity to do it. But ask one thing, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: pay your fair share.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Just pay your fair share. I really mean it. If you know anything about me, check me out. We have more corporations registered in Delaware than all the rest of America combined, combined, combined. I represented it for 36 years.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I've never seen a time when we have the middle class growing that the wealthy didn't do very, very, very well. So that's what we have to do, build it out and up, not just down.]

Don Lemmon 43:24
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: So the people like our next guest, who just graduated from law school, by the way, his name is Corey Markham. He's at a graduate from the University of Cincinnati law school, and he is getting, excuse me, graduate. He's heading to law school. I'm wrong in the fall. So Corey, good luck in law school.]

Joe Biden 43:38
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And what's your question your freshman year? Wish you had already graduated. I know me too.]

Speaker 5 43:43
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Yeah.] So my question is [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: last week regarding the GOP efforts to restrict voting rights, you said those efforts were, quote, The most dangerous threat to voting and the integrity of free affair elections in our history. End. Quote. While you have condemned these attacks, you and congressional members of your party have done little to actually stop these assaults. If these efforts are really the most dangerous in our history, isn't it logical to get rid of the filibuster so we can protect our democracy and secure the right to vote the]

Joe Biden 44:26
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I stand by what I said.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Never before has there been an attempt by state legislatures to take over the ability to determine who won. Not count the votes determine who won. We have election officials across the board that they're deciding to push out of the way.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: And if, in fact, tomorrow, let's, let's say we're running last time and we're this these laws have been in effect. That are these changes in Georgia, the Georgia legislature Biden won. By multiple 1000 votes, they could say, we don't think it was legit, and the state legislative votes, we're going to send electors up to Congress to vote for Trump, not Biden.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: That's never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever been tried before. This is Jim Crow on on steroids, what we're talking about.] And so it takes go to your second point. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I've been saying for a long, long time, the abuse of the filibuster is pretty overwhelming] when I got to the United States Senate at a time when we had guys like Jim Eastland and Strom Thurmond and Robert F Byrd and a whole range of people who were very, very, very, very, very conservative on race, to say the least. Even then, if you were to filibuster, you had to stand on the floor and hold the floor. And that's why Strom, I think, set the record at 24 straight hours or something. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Don't hold me the number, but you know, so you had to take there were significantly fewer filibusters in those days in the middle of]

Don Lemmon 46:07
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: the Civil Rights Movement. But let me, let me do let me talk to you about that.] Let me finish

Joe Biden 46:11
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: my answer.] Because [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: I tell you what I do, I would go back to that where you have to maintain the floor. You have to stand there and talk and hold the floor. You can't just say, I understand]

Don Lemmon 46:22
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: that. But what difference is that, if you hold the floor for, you know, a day or a year, what difference does it make? Here's the thing for me, you talked about people, and this is important for people who look like me. My grandmother would sit around when I was a kid fifth grade. Had a fifth grade education. I learned that she couldn't read when I was doing my homework, she would tell me stories about people asking her to count the number of jelly beans in the jar or the soap and so why is protecting the filibuster? Is that more important than protecting voting rights, especially for people who fought and died for that? No, it's not.]

Joe Biden 47:01
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I not. I want to see United States Congress, United States Senate, pass s1 and s4 the John Lewis act. Get on my desk so I can sign them.] But here's the deal. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: What I also want to do. I want to make sure we bring along, not just all the Democrats, we bring along Republicans who I know know better. They know better than this.] And what I don't want to do is get wrapped up right now in the argument whether or not this is all about the filibuster or look, [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: the American public, you can't stop them from voting. You tried last time. More people voted last time than any time in American history. In the middle of the worst pandemic in American history, more people did and they showed up. They're going to show up again. They're going to do it again.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: But what I want to do is I'm trying to bring the country together, and I don't want the debate to only be about whether or not we have a filibuster, or exceptions of the filibuster, or the going back to the way the filibuster had]

Don Lemmon 48:06
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: to be used before. Isn't that the only way you're going to get it done right now?] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: I don't believe that.] I think we can get it done if you, if you, you agree with the former president, he is called your as you call him your old boss, that it is a relic of Jim Crow. If it's a relic of Jim Crow, it's been used to fight against civil rights legislation historically. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Why protect it?]

Joe Biden 48:25
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: There's no reason to protect it, other than you're going to throw the entire Congress into chaos and nothing will get done. Nothing at all will get done.] And there's a lot at stake. [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: The most important one is the right to vote. That's the single most important one and your vote. Count it and count it by someone who honestly counts it.] But it goes beyond that. For example, [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: wouldn't my friends in the other side love to have a debate about the filibuster instead of passing the Recovery Act?] Or wouldn't they love doing it instead of being in a position where we provide for how many of you have children under the age of 17? Raise your hand. Guess what? You're getting a lot of money in a monthly check now, aren't you? [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: No, you deserve no, no, no. I really mean it. Republicans used to fight for it as well. It's called the child tax credit. If you have a child under the age of seven, you get 300 bucks a month, 350 bucks a month. If you have a child under between seven and 17, you get a total of 200 bucks a month. And guess what? It's cutting child poverty in half, in half,] Mr.

Don Lemmon 49:35
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: President, we're gonna talk about something else that affects people a lot, and it's the children as well. The next question, and it's about gun violence. This is from a paralegal. She's an advocate. Her name is Andrea Solis canto. She's a Democrat. Andrea, go ahead.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I stay a public defender, kiddo,]

Joe Biden 49:51
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: thanks for what you're doing.]

Speaker 6 49:53
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Thank you.] So [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: gun violence has been on the rise across the country, and as a recent student and young professional living in over. The Rhine, I've seen this firsthand. Gun violence has taken the lives of so many young students and young people. I'm tired, and I want to see change. It's going to make our cities like Cincinnati safer. So how will you address gun violence from a federal point of view, to actually bring about change and make our local cities safer?]

Joe Biden 50:19
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Now I'm not being a wise guy.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: There's no reason you should have you seen my gun violence legislation I've introduced, as you know, because you're so involved. Actually, crime is down. Gun violence and murder rates are up. Guns I'm the only guy that ever got passed legislation when I was a senator to make sure we eliminated assault weapons. The idea you need a weapon that can have the ability to fire 2030, 4050, 120 shots from that weapon, whether it's a whether it's a nine millimeter pistol or whether it's a rifle, is ridiculous. I'm continuing to push to eliminate the sale of those things, but I'm not likely to get that done in the near term.] So here's what I've done. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The people who, in fact, are using those weapons, are acquiring them illegally, illegally. And so what happens is I've gotten ATF, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. I have them increase their budget and increase their capacity, along with the Justice Department, to go after the gun shops that are not abiding by the law of doing background checks for real that's number one. Number two. Number two, we're in a position where you most of the cities, and I don't know enough, I think you've had a lot of gun violence here in Cincinnati. I think it was up to what? How many, how many dead, 500 over a period. Don't hold me the number, whatever it was. But my point is all across the country, and it's not because the gun shops in the cities are selling these guns. They are either shadow gun dealers and or gun shops that are not abiding by the law. So we're going to do major investigations and shut those guys down and put some of them in jail, and for what they're doing, selling these weapons, there's also a thing called ghost guns that are being sold now and being used and so but in addition to that, what we have to do is we have to deal with the larger problem of the whole issue of law enforcement generally. We're in a situation where as much as the we need to pass the Floyd act and all that. But here's the deal, cops are having real trouble. They're not all bad guys. They're a lot of good guys. We need more policemen, not fewer policemen, but we need them involved in community policing, community policing.] And when we did that, violent crime went down all the criticisms about the original crime bill, guess what? [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Crime went down until we stopped doing community policing.] So it's about getting we have availability now of over billion lots of money for cops to be able to hire psychologists, psychiatrists as well as social workers to be engaged in the process, Mr.

Don Lemmon 53:24
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: President, we're going to put a period, maybe a comma right here, because we have more to come. We got to take a quick break. We'll be right back more from President Joe Biden, right after]

[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: this, welcome back to our CNN town hall with the President of the United States, Joe Biden,] I just want I said we were going to put a comma on it, because I want to continue this conversation. You said that you need, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we need more police, right? Your words. So then, how do you respond to Republicans who try to paint you and your party as anti police?]

Joe Biden 53:56
[TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: They're lying.] No look. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Never once we have to change police conduct. We have to have rules where things are open. We have to have rules where you can be able to determine what the background how many times a cop has violated the rules, and be able to have access to what's going on in police departments so the Justice Department can get involved in whether or not they have to change their pattern and practices.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I've always said]

Don Lemmon 54:27
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: that, what about defunding the police? Though? Because there's]

Joe Biden 54:29
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: never, never, never said defunding the police.] Look, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I don't know any community, particularly the communities that are in the most need and the poorest and the most at risk that don't want police. They want police, though, to look at them as equals. They want police to treat them in a way they don't want police abusing] and [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: what happened was we got in the position where we used to have community policing, where the cop, my deceased son, was the Attorney General of the State of Delaware. Yeah. And what we did when the original bill got passed was he would go down in the tough neighborhoods in my in my state, in my city of Wilmington, which is overwhelming minority city, and he'd go where the bet you everybody can tell me where the best basketball is played in a playground here in this city. You know where it is. You know who the best ball players are. You know where they are. He'd go down and sit there on the bench with his son, my my grandson, who's now 16, when he was five and six years old, and let them know he was there. He'd go over and knock on the window of the local cop, who was sitting there by himself in a squadron. Said, get out of the car, meet people.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Because what used to happen was cops used to when at first community policing came about, they'd go in, they knew who the minister was in the church, they knew who owned the local liquor store, the local drug store, the local grocery store, and they'd walk in and say, Look, I'm Joe Biden. I'm going to be in this speech. Here's my cell number. You have a problem. Call me. Here's my cell number.]

Don Lemmon 56:01
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: You said it's tough right now. You said police are up against, well, they're up against the narrative that you know the country's anti police. Democrats are anti police. Joe Biden is anti police. And then you have]

Joe Biden 56:11
[TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: They aren't saying Joe Biden is anti police. Cops are not saying that about Joe Biden. They know me, period. Go on. They're not saying it.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Republicans are saying it on the far. I'm not anyway.]

Don Lemmon 56:28
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: No, I want you to talk about this because, I mean, it's an important narrative. There is no more important issue, I think, right now than safety. You can, you can rebuild a home. You can, you know, get a lot of things back, but Mr. President, you cannot get back a life. That's exactly right. Yeah, and if police aren't doing their jobs, that increases.]

Joe Biden 56:46
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: No. If police aren't doing their job, they should be held accountable. They should be fired. If they're not doing their job, they should I have no I make no excuses for that, that we should have. For example, the George Floyd act, where chokeholds are against the law, where a whole lot of things that are laid out in that legislation.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: And by the way, I grew up in a neighborhood where you became a cop, a firefighter or a priest, I wouldn't qualify for any one of them. So here I am. But all kidding aside, I'm not joking the guys who grew up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, steeltown, that's what we did. That's what they did, as my friends did.] And here's the point. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The point is that they doesn't justify maltreating the public. You have no right to do that, none. But now what's happening is, because they become it's become so tough across the spectrum, we've actually cut down on a number of police unrelated to anybody asking for it, the towns and cities aren't spending as much money on it. There's not as much federal money to hire police. And now what's happening is police are not wanting to be a cop. Raise your hand if you want to be a cop. Now, what do you think? Huh,] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: so what we got to do is we got to give them the help they need to be better at their job. The idea that you have someone sitting on a ledge saying they're going to jump off a ledge, and you call the cop and sending a guy or a woman who's a law enforcement officer has a criminal justice degree, when you could send with him or her, you could send with him a psychologist or a social worker or somebody can talk to them. No, I mean it. I'm serious.] Mr.

Don Lemmon 58:24
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: President, I want to get to more questions. Now. I want to bring in Lynn Miller. She's an attorney and a Democrat. Lynn, what's your]

Speaker 2 58:30
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: question? Mr. President,] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: the opioid crisis continues, and in this part of the country, it remains a huge problem, while the over prescription of opiates is part of that problem, the drugs available in the black market are a growing issue, as many of these contain fentanyl that took the life of our son. How can your administration combat the issue of illegal opiates, many of which our young people buy online. Someone should bear responsibility for delivering death through the mail,]

Joe Biden 59:01
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: they should bear responsibility.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: You may or may not be aware, even in the period when I was out of office, I was railing against the fact that drug companies were selling on the open market. There was one case which really got me was you had two drug stores in a small town in West Virginia having something like prescription for 4000 pills. And it was obviously drug trafficking. That's what was going on. So what we did was, what they did was they went after they just settled with Johnson and some of the drug companies who make opioids for 26 was it 26 billion or 27 today? If I'm not mistaken, the settlement took place.] But here's the deal. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: In addition to that, you have the Chinese sending fentanyl to Mexico, in large part, that's being mixed with opioids and or heroin and other drugs, which is a dead set killer of people. And so what we have to do, I've had this. Encounter with China, we're going to continue it, but we've also increased the number of de agents, what we're doing at the border and how we're going to deal with the intercepting that drug trade. In addition to that, the Justice Department is moving on dealing with the whole opioid issue by increasing significantly the number the number the number of people in Justice Department working on this issue,] and so there's much more to say about it, but [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: it is incredibly, incredibly dangerous.]

Don Lemmon 1:00:31
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Mr. President, I believe there's no better way than to speak about this. From experience. I don't think there's probably a family in this room who hasn't been affected by addiction. You've been very open about your son, Hunter's problems with addiction. This is personal for you. Listen, I've dealt with it in my own family. Every family deals with it, but this is personal for]

Joe Biden 1:00:51
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: you, yes, and I'm so damn proud of my son. My son just wrote a book about how he overcame being addicted, and he did it, and he's doing it, and he is in good shape. Thank God.] Here's the thing, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we don't have nearly enough people involved in mental health and drug addiction services. Number one, number one, number two, number two. We shouldn't be sending people to jail for use, we should be sending them mandatory rehabilitation. Mandatory rehabilitation. Number three, when people are in fact in jail, they should be getting if that's not the main crime, but they're also, they should be getting treatment while they are in jail. Fourth, when people get out of jail, whether it's for drug addiction or any other crime, if they've served their time, they should have full access to everything from Pell grants to public housing to the like.] And by the way, by the way, folks, [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: it's not just the right thing to do. It's the smart thing for us to do.] Because what happens? Years ago, [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: there was a guy named Arlen Specter from Pennsylvania. He and I introduced legislation that was the second chance.] What meant that right now, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: when you get out of jail and most prisons in the states around the country, what happens you get a bus ticket and 25 bucks, you end up under the bridge, just like you did before. You're almost almost guaranteed to get back in in whatever, whatever your problem was before. So they should have access to drug treatment, they should have access to housing. They should have access to whatever they qualify based on their income. And we should in prisons as well, be training people differently.] But the mind, the big thing here is [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we have to deal with the idea of addiction by providing for we all know it's a disease of the brain. It's a disease of the brain, and has to be treated as such.]

Don Lemmon 1:02:50
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I think it's, I think addiction and mental health issues have to be dealt with just as if you break your arm and go to the doctor we should be able to talk to there should be, I agree, shouldn't be a stigma about it.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: I want to bring in now Medina Nolan. Medina Nolan is a writer and editor. She's a Democrat. Medina, what's your question?]

Joe Biden 1:03:04
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Hi, Medina, good evening, Mr. President, Vice President Harris said to Guatemalans, don't come.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Recently, you have indicated you are in favor of refugees coming to this country. Could you please explain your administration's basic stance on immigration, yes, they should not come.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: What we're trying to set up is in the countries like in particular, Northern Triangle, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, et cetera. We are setting up in those countries. If you seek asylum in the United States, you can seek it from the country from your in place. You can seek it from an American embassy, you can go in and seek and see whether or not you qualify. We've significantly increased the number of officers who can hear cases as to whether or not you qualify under the law for being here as a refugee. That is, that's what we've done. Thirdly, we have been able to move significantly to change the number there were 1000s of people in in in custody with the Border Patrol. It's now cut by 90% where there's considerably down.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: What I do say is the one place you may heard that I'm talking about more immigrants coming in are those folks from Afghanistan who help the American soldiers, who will be they and their family will be victimized very badly as a consequence of what happens if they're left behind. And so we're providing for them to be able to see whether they qualify to meet this special requirement, to be able to come to the United States as a refugee and as ultimately earning citizenship. Here, it seems to me, it's the only decent thing that we can do.] In the meantime, we're going to send people. Possible to American bases where they're not gonna leave the base while their cases are being determined whether they qualify, and also other bases. I want

Don Lemmon 1:05:08
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: to talk to you about DACA. I got two questions on immigration. The quick questions I want to ask you about because just last week, there was a federal judge who ruled the program unlawful, blocked it from accepting new applications. What do you say to dreamers who are really worried about their futures here in the United]

Joe Biden 1:05:22
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: States, I'm not letting this go. Look, guys, let's just put it. Let's just put this.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: You know, we talk about dreamers sort of generically. Let's think about it. Now. What it really means you're five years old, you're nine years old, your mom or your dad says, I'm going to take you across the Rio Grande, and we're legally going to go into the United States. What are you supposed to say? Not me asking against the law. I'm not I'm being deadly earnest. What could a kid say? What could they do?] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: They come here with really no choice, and they're here, and they're good, good people. They've done well. 10,000 of them are first line workers. These are kids who've done well.] And so [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: what we're going to do is, first of all, appeal the case number one. But number two, we're going to make sure that a number of my Republican colleagues say they support the right of dreamers to come.] Let's call the question they should be able to stay in the United States of America when their child comes.

Speaker 4 1:06:38
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Mr. President,]

Don Lemmon 1:06:41
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: you've been the big guy for six months now in the White House. Can you take us behind the scenes, something that was extraordinary or unusual, that happened that stands out to you?]

Joe Biden 1:06:50
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Yeah, Mr. President, didn't close the door. Mr. President, what the hell are you going out at this time for? You know, it's a wonderful honor. I here, as you can tell, I hope I have very good manners, but I'm not very hung up on protocol and I and the Secret Service is wonderful, and because things are so]

[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: because things are are so crazy out there, it is very hard to get comfortable,]

[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: like I would ordinary Be. For example, I think all of the all the help that's there, providing meals, and all the rest, I think they love us. You say, Don't come in for breakfast. We can get our own breakfast, because I like to walk out of my robe and go in. No, no. You think I'm joking. I'm not. You know what I mean.] And so it's just a, you know, the only place I have felt like what the office connotes is when I went to Europe and watched the rest of the heads of state react to me, not me, because I'm the president of the United States of America, the United States of America. And here's what happened. [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: It's the first time I ever felt like you always hear say, leader of the free world. Well, I realize when I'm sitting across from Putin who I know. He knows who I am. I know who he is. He knows I mean what I say, and can do what I say. He understands doesn't mean he will do it or not do it. But tornadoes, it's the first time I've ever felt the notion that I am in the office that is the leader of the free world, and we must be the leader of the free world if we don't do it, nobody good is likely to do it, has the capacity to do it. I really mean it. I genuinely mean it.] So it's the thing, [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Don that is the only time. And by the way, the first time I walked downstairs and they played Hail to the Chief. I wonder, where is he? No, you think I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. You know, I mean, it's a great tune, is it? It's a great tune, but I, you know, you feel a little self conscious, but you think I'm kidding. I'm not, but I am not at all self conscious about the power that goes with the office as it relates to resolving issues. These are issues I've dealt with my whole life, whether I'm good or bad. I have more experience coming to the office than anyone who's ever held that office. I have done I've been deeply steeped in foreign policy, the justice system, the economic not that I'm right. I don't mean that, but nothing's come before me where I've gone. Oh. My God, I never, I never thought, you know what the difference is.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: I used to kid Barack, he's a good friend President Obama. And, you know, at one point, I'd always be the I was always the last guy in the room for real on every important decision. I got to give my advice. I gave him all the way, but I'd be the last guy before I walked out. And one day he thanked me. I said, Mr. President, here's the deal. I should be paying you, not you me, because I get to give you the advice, and then I get to leave. I'm serious.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Think about it. The one thing that is real, that is different, I don't and I feel comfortable with it, but is, you're the last guy in the room. You decide is the decision I'm about to make, will that cause war? Will that cause conflict? The decision I'm about to make, is that going to hurt people, it's going to help people. That's the part that is different, but the living conditions.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: I mean, it's such a great, great honor to live in the White House, but quite frankly, I kid the Vice President, like one day Barack came over to nave ops, called naval operations, the vice president's residence, which is on about, I guess, 8090, acres. It's a beautiful, beautiful spot, and there's a fence around the whole property that you miss that, don't you? I do. And Brock came over and he said, This is great. And I said, I'll tell you. I said, trade you only if the power goes with it.] But the point is that there, it was totally different. You can walk out in your shorts with a short sleeve shirt on, and you can walk around and there wasn't anybody there. You can't walk out anywhere now. But [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I'm not complaining. I'm trying to answer your question as honestly as I can. I just It's the greatest honor I think, could ever be bestowed on an American that a majority of the American citizens said, I want you to lead the country.] And [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: it's a great honor, a great honor, when you have presidents and prime ministers or the rest of the world saying, you know, what does the United States think you're the leader of the free world? I was able to go to the g7 and change their mind about a whole range of things they never once had included China in any criticism of what was going on. They're very reluctant to be able to be in a position you and I have talked about this, about whether or not they're going to do business with China in a way that, you know, pushes America aside all of a sudden, if you notice, we're getting a great deal, not because of me, but because of the administration I've put together. And America is back. Traditional America is more back, and they're willing to follow us. I think,] Well, Mr.

Don Lemmon 1:12:51
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: President, Mr. President, here's the deal. Mr. President, here's the deal. I'm the last guy that gets to ask you questions tonight. Oh yeah, and then I get to leave.]

Joe Biden 1:13:05
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Thank you. Thanks, man. I appreciate it.]

Don Lemmon 1:13:07
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: We're so glad that you guys are here and that you got to ask questions with the President of the United States. Thank you so much. Thank you to our audience, for everyone for being here, taking questions, of course. Thank you to the President of United States. We want to thank Mount St Joseph's University, right here in]

Joe Biden 1:13:21
