# Document Analysis - Marked Up Text

GEORGE W. BUSH
Address to a Joint Session of Congress
January 28, 2003

[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Thank you all. Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress,
members of the Supreme Court and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests,
and fellow citizens:] Today our Nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous
woman who called America to its founding ideals and carried on a noble
dream. [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the
husband who was taken so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of
Coretta Scott King.]
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Every time I'm invited to this rostrum, I'm humbled by the privilege and
mindful of the history we've seen together.] We have gathered under this
Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement.
We have served America through one of the most consequential periods of
our history, and it has been my honor to serve with you.
In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there
will always be differences and debate. [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: But even tough debates can be
conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden
into anger.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of
good will and respect for one another, and I will do my part.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Tonight the
state of our Union is strong, and together we will make it stronger.]
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: In this decisive year, you and I will make choices that determine both the
future and the character of our country.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: We will choose to act confidently in
pursuing the enemies of freedom, or retreat from our duties in the hope of
an easier life.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: We will choose to build our prosperity by leading the
world
economy, or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity.] In a complex
and challenging time, [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem
broad and inviting, yet it ends in danger and decline.] The only way to
protect our people, the only way to secure the peace, the only way to
control our destiny is by our leadership. [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: So the United States of America will
continue to lead.]
Abroad, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: our Nation is committed to an historic, long-term goal: We seek the
end of tyranny in our world.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism.] In reality, the future security of America depends on it. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: On September the
11th, 2001, we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive
state 7,000 miles away could bring murder and destruction to our country.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Dictatorships shelter terrorists, and feed resentment and radicalism, and
seek weapons of mass destruction.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Democracies replace resentment with
hope, respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbors, and join the
fight against terror.] Every step toward freedom in the world makes our
country safer, [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: so we will act boldly in freedom's cause.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Far from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great story
of our time. In 1945, there were about two dozen lonely democracies in the
world. Today, there are 122. And we're writing a new chapter in the story of
self-government—with women lining up to vote in Afghanistan, and millions
of Iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink, and men and women from
Lebanon to Egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of
freedom. At the start of 2006, more than half the people of our world live in
democratic nations.] And we do not forget the other half—in places like Syria
and Burma, Zimbabwe, North Korea, and Iran—[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: because the demands of
justice and the peace of this world require their freedom as well.]
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: No one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight
against it.] And one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: radical
Islam—the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror
and death.] [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: Terrorists like bin Laden are serious about mass murder, and all
of us must take their declared intentions seriously.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: They seek to impose a
heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the Middle East and arm
themselves with weapons of mass murder.]
[MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: Their aim is to seize power in Iraq and use it as a safe haven to launch
attacks against America and the world.] Lacking the military strength to
challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear. [DEHUMANIZING_LANGUAGE: When
they murder children at a school in Beslan or blow up commuters in
London or behead a bound captive, the terrorists hope these horrors will
break our will, allowing the violent to inherit the Earth.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: But they have
miscaluculated: We love our freedom, and we will fight to keep it.]
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: In a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our
commitments and retreating within our borders.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: If we were to leave these
vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone. They would simply
move the battlefield to our own shores.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: There is no peace in retreat, and
there is no honor in retreat.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: By allowing radical Islam to work its will, by
leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself, we would signal to all that we
no longer believe in our own ideals or even in our own courage.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: But our
enemies and our friends can be certain: The United States will not retreat
from the world, and we will never surrender to evil.]
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: America rejects the false comfort of isolationism.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We are the nation that
saved liberty in Europe and liberated death camps and helped raise up
democracies and faced down an evil empire.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Once again, we accept the call
of history to deliver the oppressed and move this world toward peace.] We
remain on the offensive against terror networks. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We have killed or captured
many of their leaders. And for the others, their day will come.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We remain on the offensive in Afghanistan, where a fine President and a
National Assembly are fighting terror while building the institutions of a
new democracy.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We're on the offensive in Iraq with a clear plan for victory.]
First, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we're helping Iraqis build an inclusive government, so that old
resentments will be eased and the insurgency will be marginalized.] Second,
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we're continuing reconstruction efforts and helping the Iraqi Government
to fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all Iraqis can
experience the benefits of freedom.] And third, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we're striking terrorist
targets while we train Iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating
the enemy.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Iraqis are showing their courage every day, and we are proud to
be their allies in the cause of freedom.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our work in Iraq is difficult because our enemy is brutal.] But that brutality
has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: In less than 3
years, the nation has gone from dictatorship to liberation, to sovereignty, to
a Constitution, to national elections.] At the same time, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: our coalition has
been relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgent
strongholds, and turning over territory to Iraqi security forces.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I am
confident in our plan for victory; I am confident in the will of the Iraqi
people; I am confident in the skill and spirit of our military. Fellow citizens,
we are in this fight to win, and we are winning.]
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: The road of victory is the road that will take our troops home.] As we make
progress on the ground and Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead, we
should be able to further decrease our troop levels. But those decisions will
be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, DC.
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our coalition has learned from our experience in Iraq. We've adjusted our
military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction.] [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Along the way,
we have benefited from responsible criticism and counsel offered by
Members of Congress of both parties. In the coming year, I will continue to
reach out and seek your good advice.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Yet there is a difference between
responsible criticism that aims for success and defeatism that refuses to
acknowledge anything but failure.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Hindsight alone is not wisdom, and
second-guessing is not a strategy.]
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: With so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty to
speak with candor.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would
abandon our Iraqi allies to death and prison, would put men like bin Laden
and Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country, and show that a pledge from
America means little.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Members of Congress, however we feel about the
decisions and debates of the past, our Nation has only one option: We must
keep our word, defeat our enemies, and stand behind the American military
in this vital mission.]
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices and showing a sense
of duty stronger than all fear.] They know what it's like to fight house to
house in a maze of streets, to wear heavy gear in the desert heat, to see a
comrade killed by a roadside bomb. And those who know the costs also
know the stakes. Marine Staff Sergeant Dan Clay was killed last month
fighting in Fallujah. He left behind a letter to his family, but his words could
just as well be addressed to every American. [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Here is what Dan wrote: "I
know what honor is— it has been an honor to protect and serve all of you. I
faced death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to. Never
falter. Don't hesitate to honor and support those of us who have the honor
of protecting that which is worth protecting."]
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Staff Sergeant Dan Clay's wife, Lisa, and his mom and dad, Sara Jo and Bud,
are with us this evening. Welcome.]
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Our Nation is grateful to the fallen, who live in the memory of our country.
We're grateful to all who volunteer to wear our Nation's uniform. And as we
honor our brave troops, let us never forget the sacrifices of America's
military families.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our offensive against terror involves more than military action.] Ultimately,
the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred
and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and
peaceful change. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: So the United States of America supports democratic
reform across the broader Middle East.] Elections are vital, but they are only
the beginning. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Raising up a democracy requires the rule of law and
protection of minorities and strong, accountable institutions that last longer
than a single vote.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The great people of Egypt have voted in a multiparty Presidential election,
and now their Government should open paths of peaceful opposition that
will reduce the appeal of radicalism.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The Palestinian people have voted in
elections, and now the leaders of Hamas must recognize Israel, disarm,
reject terrorism, and work for lasting peace.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Saudi Arabia has taken the first
steps of reform; now it can offer its people a better future by pressing
forward with those efforts.] Democracies in the Middle East will not look like
our own, because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens. [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Yet
liberty is the future of every nation in the Middle East because liberty is the
right and hope of all humanity.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The same is true of Iran, a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elite
that is isolating and repressing its people.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The regime in that country
sponsors terrorists in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon, and that
must come to an end.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The Iranian Government is defying the world with its
nuclear ambitions, and the nations of the world must not permit the Iranian
regime to gain nuclear weapons.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: America will continue to rally the world to
confront these threats.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: Tonight let me speak directly to the citizens of Iran: America respects you,
and we respect your country. We respect your right to choose your own
future and win your own freedom. And our Nation hopes one day to be the
closest of friends with a free and democratic Iran.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: To overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by
encouraging economic progress and fighting disease and spreading hope in
hopeless lands.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: Isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting
enemies, it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: We
show compassion abroad because Americans believe in the God-given
dignity and worth of a villager with HIV/AIDS or an infant with malaria or a
refugee fleeing genocide or a young girl sold into slavery.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We also show
compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by poverty, corruption,
and despair are sources of terrorism and organized crime and human
trafficking and the drug trade.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: In recent years, you and I have taken unprecedented action to fight AIDS
and malaria, expand the education of girls, and reward developing nations
that are moving forward with economic and political reform.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: For people
everywhere, the United States is a partner for a better life. Shortchanging
these efforts would increase the suffering and chaos of our world, undercut
our long-term security, and dull the conscience of our country.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I urge
Members of Congress to serve the interests of America by showing the
compassion of America.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at
home.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us.
Fortunately, this Nation has superb professionals in law enforcement,
intelligence, the military, and homeland security. These men and women
are dedicating their lives, protecting us all, and they deserve our support
and our thanks.] They also deserve the same tools they already use to fight
drug trafficking and organized crime, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: so I ask you to reauthorize the
PATRIOT Act.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: It is said that prior to the attacks of September the 11th, our Government
failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy.] We now know that two of the
hijackers in the United States placed telephone calls to Al Qaida operatives
overseas. But we did not know about their plans until it was too late. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: So to
prevent another attack—based on authority given to me by the Constitution
and by statute—I have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to
aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected Al
Qaida operatives and affiliates to and from America.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Previous Presidents have used the same constitutional authority I have, and
Federal courts have approved the use of that authority. Appropriate
Members of Congress have been kept informed. The terrorist surveillance
program has helped prevent terrorist attacks.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: It remains essential to the
security of America. If there are people inside our country who are talking
with Al Qaida, we want to know about it, because we will not sit back and
wait to be hit again.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: In all these areas—from the disruption of terror networks, to victory in Iraq,
to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions—we need the
support of our friends and allies.] To draw that support, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must always be
clear in our principles and willing to act.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: The only alternative to American
leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Yet we also
choose to lead because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us
birth.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: American leaders—from Roosevelt to Truman to Kennedy to Reagan
—rejected isolation and retreat, because they knew that America is always
more secure when freedom is on the march.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy, a war that
will be fought by Presidents of both parties who will need steady bipartisan
support from the Congress. And tonight I ask for yours.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Together, let us
protect our country, support the men and women who defend us, and lead
this world toward freedom.]
Here at home, America also has a great opportunity: [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will build the
prosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the
world.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Our economy is healthy and vigorous and growing faster than other major
industrialized nations. In the last 2 1/2 years, America has created 4.6
million new jobs, more than Japan and the European Union combined. Even
in the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters, the American
people have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the
world.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: The American economy is preeminent, but we cannot afford to be
complacent.] In a dynamic world economy, [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: we are seeing new competitors
like China and India, and this creates uncertainty, which makes it easier to
feed people's fears.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: So we're seeing some old temptations return.]
[BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Protectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we can keep our
high standard of living while walling off our economy.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: Others say that the
government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy,
centralizing more power in Washington and increasing taxes.] [BAD_FAITH_DISMISSAL: We hear
claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy, even though
this economy could not function without them.] [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: All these are forms of
economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction, toward a stagnant
and second-rate economy.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Tonight I will set out a better path: an agenda for a nation that competes
with confidence; an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate
new jobs.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Americans should not fear our economic future because we
intend to shape it.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Keeping America competitive begins with keeping our economy growing.]
And our economy grows when Americans have more of their own money to
spend, save, and invest. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: In the last 5 years, the tax relief you passed has left
$880 billion in the hands of American workers, investors, small businesses,
and families. And they have used it to help produce more than 4 years of
uninterrupted economic growth.] Yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next
few years. [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: If we do nothing, American families will face a massive tax
increase they do not expect and will not welcome.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Because America needs
more than a temporary expansion, we need more than temporary tax relief, I urge the Congress to act responsibly and make the tax cuts permanent.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Keeping America competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax
dollars.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Every year of my Presidency, we've reduced the growth of
nonsecurity discretionary spending, and last year, you passed bills that cut
this spending.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: This year, my budget will cut it again and reduce or eliminate
more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling
essential priorities.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: By passing these reforms, we will save the American
taxpayer another $14 billion next year and stay on track to cut the deficit in
half by 2009.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I am pleased that Members of Congress are working on earmark reform,
because the Federal budget has too many special interest projects.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: And we
can tackle this problem together, if you pass the line-item veto.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, or
entitlements.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: This year, the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn 60,
including two of my dad's favorite people—me and President Clinton.
[Laughter] This milestone is more than a personal crisis—[laughter]— it is a
national challenge. The retirement of the baby boom generation will put
unprecedented strains on the Federal Government. By 2030, spending for
Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of
the entire Federal budget.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: And that will present future Congresses with
impossible choices: staggering tax increases, immense deficits, or deep cuts
in every category of spending.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Congress did not act last year on my
proposal to save Social Security, yet the rising cost of entitlements is a
problem that is not going away.] [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: And every year we fail to act, the situation
gets worse.]
[AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: So tonight I ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the full
impact of baby boom retirements on Social Security, Medicare, and
Medicaid.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: This commission should include Members of Congress of both
parties and offer bipartisan solutions. We need to put aside partisan politics
and work together and get this problem solved.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Keeping America competitive requires us to open more markets for all that
Americans make and grow.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: One out of every five factory jobs in America is
related to global trade, and we want people everywhere to buy American.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: With open markets and a level playing field, no one can outproduce or
outcompete the American worker.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Keeping America competitive requires an immigration system that upholds
our laws, reflects our values, and serves the interests of our economy.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our
Nation needs orderly and secure borders.] To meet this goal, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must have
stronger immigration enforcement and border protection.] And [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must
have a rational, humane guest-worker program that rejects amnesty, allows
temporary jobs for people who seek them legally, and reduces smuggling
and crime at the border.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Keeping America competitive requires affordable health care.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Our
Government has a responsibility to provide health care for the poor and the
elderly, and we are meeting that responsibility.] For all Americans, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must
confront the rising cost of care, strengthen the doctor-patient relationship,
and help people afford the insurance coverage they need.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will make wider use of electronic records and other health information
technology to help control costs and reduce dangerous medical errors.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We
will strengthen health savings accounts, making sure individuals and small-
business employees can buy insurance with the same advantages that
people working for big businesses now get.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will do more to make this
coverage portable, so workers can switch jobs without having to worry
about losing their health insurance.] And [TRUTH_AS_WEAPON: because lawsuits are driving many
good doctors out of practice, leaving women in nearly 1,500 American
counties without a single ob-gyn, I ask the Congress to pass medical liability
reform this year.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Keeping America competitive requires affordable energy.] And here we have
a serious problem: [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from
unstable parts of the world.] The best way to break this addiction is through
technology. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Since 2001, we have spent nearly $10 billion to develop cleaner,
cheaper, and more reliable alternative energy sources. And we are on the
threshold of incredible advances.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: So tonight I announce the Advanced Energy Initiative—a 22-percent
increase in clean-energy research at the Department of Energy—to push for
breakthroughs in two vital areas.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: To change how we power our homes and
offices, we will invest more in zero-emission coal-fired plants, revolutionary
solar and wind technologies, and clean, safe nuclear energy.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We must also change how we power our automobiles. We will increase our
research in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars and in pollution-free
cars that run on hydrogen. We'll also fund additional research in cutting-
edge methods of producing ethanol, not just from corn but from wood
chips and stalks or switchgrass.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol
practical and competitive within 6 years.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach
another great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from
the Middle East by 2025.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: By applying the talent and technology of America,
this country can dramatically improve our environment, move beyond a
petroleum-based economy, and make our dependence on Middle Eastern
oil a thing of the past.]
And to keep America competitive, one commitment is necessary above all:
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Our
greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated, hard-
working, ambitious people. And we're going to keep that edge.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Tonight I
announce an American Competitiveness Initiative to encourage innovation
throughout our economy and to give our Nation's children a firm grounding
in math and science.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: First, I propose to double the Federal commitment to the most critical basic
research programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: This
funding will support the work of America's most creative minds as they
explore promising areas such as nanotechnology, supercomputing, and
alternative energy sources.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Second, I propose to make permanent the research and development tax
credit to encourage bolder private sector initiative in technology.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: With more
research in both the public and private sectors, we will improve our quality
of life and ensure that America will lead the world in opportunity and
innovation for decades to come.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Third, we need to encourage children to take more math and science, and
to make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other
nations.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: We've made a good start in the early grades with the No Child Left
Behind Act, which is raising standards and lifting test scores across our
country.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Tonight I propose to train 70,000 high school teachers to lead
Advanced Placement courses in math and science, bring 30,000 math and
science professionals to teach in classrooms, and give early help to
students who struggle with math, so they have a better chance at good,
high-wage jobs.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: If we ensure that America's children succeed in life, they will
ensure that America succeeds in the world.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Preparing our Nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us can
share.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: I urge you to support the American Competitiveness Initiative, and
together we will show the world what the American people can achieve.]
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: America is a great force for freedom and prosperity. Yet our greatness is
not measured in power or luxuries but by who we are and how we treat
one another.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: So we strive to be a compassionate, decent, hopeful society.]
In recent years, America has become a more hopeful nation. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Violent crime
rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s. Welfare cases have
dropped by more than half over the past decade. Drug use among youth is
down 19 percent since 2001. There are fewer abortions in America than at
any point in the last three decades, and the number of children born to
teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in a row.]
[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: These gains are evidence of a quiet transformation, a revolution of
conscience, in which a rising generation is finding that a life of personal
responsibility is a life of fulfillment.] [CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: Government has played a role. Wise
policies, such as welfare reform and drug education and support for
abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the character of our
country.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: And everyone here tonight, Democrat and Republican, has a right
to be proud of this record.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Yet many Americans, especially parents, still have deep concerns about the
direction of our culture and the health of our most basic institutions.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: They're concerned about unethical conduct by public officials and
discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine marriage.] They worry
about children in our society who need direction and love, and about fellow
citizens still displaced by natural disaster, and about suffering caused by
treatable diseases.
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: As we look at these challenges, we must never give in to the belief that
America is in decline or that our culture is doomed to unravel.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: The
American people know better than that. We have proven the pessimists
wrong before, and we will do it again.]
A hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under the
law. [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: The Supreme Court now has two superb new members on its bench,
Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sam Alito.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: I thank the Senate for
confirming both of them.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I will continue to nominate men and women who
understand that judges must be servants of the law and not legislate from
the bench.]
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Today marks the official retirement of a very special American. For 24 years
of faithful service to our Nation, the United States is grateful to Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor.]
A hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut
ethical corners and that recognize the matchless value of every life. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: Tonight
I ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of
medical research: human cloning in all its forms; creating or implanting
embryos for experiments; creating human-animal hybrids; and buying,
selling, or patenting human embryos.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Human life is a gift from our Creator,
and that gift should never be discarded, devalued, or put up for sale.]
A hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust.
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: Honorable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen the
ethical standards of Washington. I support your efforts.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Each of us has
made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility, and that is a pledge we
must never forget, never dismiss, and never betray.]
[COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: As we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the character
of America in our compassion and care for one another.]
[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: A hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction and
love.] Through the Helping America's Youth Initiative, [AUTHENTIC_ENGAGEMENT: we are encouraging
caring adults to get involved in the life of a child.] And this good work is
being led by our First Lady, Laura Bush. [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: This year, we will add resources to
encourage young people to stay in school, so more of America's youth can
raise their sights and achieve their dreams.]
[CHARITABLE_INTERPRETATION: A hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering
and emergency and stays at it until they're back on their feet.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: So far the
Federal Government has committed $85 billion to the people of the gulf
coast and New Orleans.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We're removing debris and repairing highways and
rebuilding stronger levees. We're providing business loans and housing
assistance.] Yet as we meet these immediate needs, [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: we must also address
deeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: In New Orleans and in other places, many of our fellow citizens have felt
excluded from the promise of our country.] The answer is not only
temporary relief but [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: schools that teach every child and job skills that bring
upward mobility and more opportunities to own a home and start a
business.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: As we recover from a disaster, let us also work for the day when
all Americans are protected by justice, equal in hope, and rich in
opportunity.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: A hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like HIV/AIDS, which can be
prevented and treated and defeated.] [TRUTH_WITH_CARE: More than a million Americans live
with HIV, and half of all AIDS cases occur among African Americans.] [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: I ask
Congress to reform and reauthorize the Ryan White Act and provide new
funding to States, so we end the waiting lists for AIDS medicines in America.]
[ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: We will also lead a nationwide effort, working closely with African American
churches and faith-based groups, to deliver rapid HIV tests to millions, end
the stigma of AIDS, and come closer to the day when there are no new
infections in America.]
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Fellow citizens, we've been called to leadership in a period of consequence.]
[IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: We've entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite.] We see
great changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives.
Sometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc toward an
unknown shore. [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Yet the destination of history is determined by human
action, and every great movement of history comes to a point of choosing.]
[TRUTH_WITH_CARE: Lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued
slavery. Martin Luther King could have stopped at Birmingham or at Selma
and achieved only half a victory over segregation. The United States could
have accepted the permanent division of Europe and been complicit in the
oppression of others.] [IRRECONCILABLE_DIVISION: Today, having come far in our own historical journey,
we must decide: Will we turn back or finish well?]
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: Before history is written down in books, it is written in courage. Like
Americans before us, we will show that courage, and we will finish well.] [COMMON_GROUND_SEEKING: We
will lead freedom's advance. We will compete and excel in the global
economy. We will renew the defining moral commitments of this land.] [DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: And
so we move forward, optimistic about our country, faithful to its cause, and
confident of the victories to come.]
[DIGNIFIED_EXPRESSION: May God bless America.]
