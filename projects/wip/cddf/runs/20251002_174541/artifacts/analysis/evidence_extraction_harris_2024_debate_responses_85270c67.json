And what I said that if we come up with something and we are working on things, we're going to do it and we're going to replace it. But remember this, I inherited Obamacare because Democrats wouldn't change it, they wouldn't vote for it. They were unanimous. They wouldn't vote to change it. If they would have done that, we would have had a much better plan than Obamacare. But the Democrats came up, they wouldn't vote for it. I had a choice to make when I was president. Do I save it and make it as good as it can be? Never going to be great, or do I let it rot, and I felt I had an obligation, even though, politically, it would have been good to just let it rot and let it go away. I decided, and I told my people, the top people, and they're very good people. I have a lot of good people in this that administration. We read about the bad ones. We had some real bad ones too. And so do they. They have really bad ones. The difference is they don't get rid of but let me just explain. I had a choice to make. Do I save it and make it as good as it can be, or do I let it rot and I saved it? I did the right thing, but it's still never going to be great and it's too expensive for people. And what we will do is we're looking at different plans, if we can come up with a plan that's going to cost our people, our population less money and be better health care than Obamacare, then I would absolutely do it, but until then, I'd run it as good as it can be run.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"dimension\": \"authentic_engagement\",\n    \"raw_score\": 0.2,\n    \"quote\": \"concepts of a plan.

Get rid of the Affordable Care Act. You have no plan, and what the Affordable Care Act has done is eliminate the ability of insurance companies to deny people with preexisting conditions. I don't have to tell the people watching tonight. You remember what that was like? Remember when an insurance company could deny if a child had asthma, if someone was a breast cancer survivor, if a if a grandparent had diabetes.

On behalf of you, the American people, Donald Trump said he was going to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. He never did. We did, and now we have capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month.
