> [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: To the authoritarian, the aesthetics of power are all-important, even more important than *actual* vehicles of power. It is a kind of sympathetic magic: Put up a bunch of Roman columns and hope they will bless you with the power of Rome. Put a Punisher skull decal on your cop car in the hope it will give you the power of vengeance. And put your soldiers in snappy jackboots in the hopes they will turn obedient to your anti-democratic goals. Authoritarians invoke power symbolically, even at the expense of systems that would actually give them power, because they are too dumb and lazy to put in the work of building power through systems. They want you to give them your power, so they insist on performing the theater of pretending they are powerful.]

For those that don’t know, the reason Russia keeps losing their generals is because (other than the ones that get thrown out windows) they put them on the front lines. The US is the opposite and keeps their generals far away from direct danger because they know they’re too valuable to risk like that. If the US ever has a brigadier general picking up a rifle, things have gone so unbelievably wrong that we’ve already lost the war]

>
> [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: At its core, it was an event that came from a very insecure place. Two men, but mostly Hegseth, desperate to feel superior to hundreds of men each with decades of military service and experience, forced them all into a room to tell them how actually *they're* the ones who are weak, because they dared to be open to diversity, don't actively torture people and recruits, and don't resort to violence at the first opportunity in every situation.]

Actual military leaders are able to separate effectiveness from propaganda, and Hegseth and Trump made it very clear that they are incapable of doing that.]

Suddenly several private media reported the "could-have-been-an-email" meme. But would Trump force all US generals to be in one place at a time, merely for that lousy speech given to them by him and Hegseth? That makes no sense to me. In particular what Hegseth babbled made no sense - bla bla bla we prefer peace but now we must prepare for war bla bla bla. 1984 novel reloaded, peace is war, war is peace and ... by the way, war against WHOM? Venezuela? China? I don't even think Trump would have the courage and will to war down China (and economically it also makes no sense considering China holds so many US bonds).]

> [MOTIVE_IMPUTATION: I am still convinced that the outrage on several media, not only reddit, seems to have caused them to change whatever they really planned. IF this is correct, then it means that The people have more power than they thought; but also that any plan was probably delayed. Trump is planning something still; I think it is just delayed, not aborted. They may plan something that is not good for later...]

> [ISSUE_FOCUSED_CRITIQUE: And, obviously, it's more and more common that drones flown by some kid sitting on his couch a thousand miles away will be inflicting all the damage, through their monitor and joystick. And even better, autonomous AI drones get unleashed by the 100,000s into the warzone.]
