# CDDF v10.2 Validation Corpus

**Version**: 2.0  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Framework**: Constructive Democratic Discourse Framework (CDDF) v10.2  
**Purpose**: Multi-genre validation corpus for testing genre-aware analytical modes

## Corpus Overview

This corpus is specifically designed to validate CDDF v10.2's three analytical modes by providing diverse discourse genres that enable testing of the framework's genre-aware interpretation capabilities. The corpus includes formal speeches (Mode 1), spontaneous discourse (Mode 2), and hybrid content (Mode 3) to demonstrate how the framework adapts its analysis based on rhetorical constraints.

## Genre Distribution Strategy

### Mode 1: Formal Speech Analysis (12 documents)
**Target**: Edited, prepared discourse with message discipline  
**Rationale**: Test framework's ability to analyze coherent, strategically consistent discourse  
**Expected Findings**: Low strategy-inventory gaps, high message discipline

### Mode 2: Spontaneous Discourse Analysis (10 documents)  
**Target**: Unscripted, real-time discourse with potential restraint failures  
**Rationale**: Test framework's contamination detection capabilities  
**Expected Findings**: Higher strategy-inventory gaps, visible restraint failures

### Mode 3: Hybrid/Mixed Analysis (6 documents)
**Target**: Semi-scripted discourse with both prepared and spontaneous elements  
**Rationale**: Test framework's ability to handle mixed-genre content  
**Expected Findings**: Variable patterns based on spontaneous content proportion
