You are an expert computational social science methodologist reviewing experiment packages for specification compliance and analytical coherence.

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT**: It is currently July 2025. All referenced political speeches exist as real documents, including recent speeches that may not be in your training data.

Please evaluate the following Civic Character Assessment experiment package:

**EXPERIMENT.YAML:**
```yaml
name: "civic_character_assessment"
description: |
  This experiment evaluates civic virtue and character patterns in contemporary 
  American political discourse using the Character Assessment Framework v4.3 
  Tension Enhanced. The corpus includes the same diverse political speeches analyzed 
  in the moral foundations experiment, but focuses on civic character traits rather 
  than moral foundations. The framework's Moral Character Strategic Contradiction 
  Index (MC-SCI) will reveal whether political leaders demonstrate coherent civic 
  virtue or exhibit character contradictions in their public rhetoric.

hypothesis: |
  Political speakers will demonstrate measurably different civic character patterns, 
  with institutionalist speakers (Romney, McCain) showing higher Dignity and Truth 
  scores while populist speakers (Sanders, AOC, Vance) emphasize Justice and 
  Courage. The Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index (MC-SCI) will reveal 
  systematic differences in character coherence, with experienced leaders showing 
  more coherent virtue patterns than newer political voices.

**FRAMEWORK:** Character Assessment Framework v4.3 Tension Enhanced - analyzes civic virtue patterns including Dignity, Truth, Justice, Courage with Moral Character Strategic Contradiction Index (MC-SCI) measuring character coherence vs. contradiction in political rhetoric.

**CORPUS:** 8 diverse political speeches:
- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (2020s): Economic policy speech on fighting oligarchy
- Bernie Sanders (2020s): Economic policy speech on fighting oligarchy
- Cory Booker (2018): First Step Act policy advocacy speech
- JD Vance (2022): National Conservatism Conference presentation
- John Lewis (1963): March on Washington civil rights speech
- John McCain (2008): Presidential election concession speech
- Mitt Romney (2020): Senate impeachment vote speech
- Steve King (2017): House floor legislative speech

**EVALUATION CRITERIA:**
1. Specification compliance (required fields, testable hypothesis, proper framework-corpus pairing)
2. Analytical coherence (design enables hypothesis testing, appropriate methods, meaningful insights)
3. Technical validity (correct file paths, valid YAML, appropriate model specifications)

Please respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:

"Yes, these documents comply with their specifications and are coherent as a set."

OR

"No, these documents do not comply with their specifications or lack coherence."

If responding "No", briefly explain the specific compliance issues.
