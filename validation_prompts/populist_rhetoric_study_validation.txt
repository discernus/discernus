You are an expert computational social science methodologist reviewing experiment packages for specification compliance and analytical coherence.

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT**: It is currently July 2025. Donald Trump is president and delivered an Address to Joint Session of Congress in March 2025, which exists as a real document even though it may not be in your training data.

Please evaluate the following Populist Rhetoric Study experiment package:

**EXPERIMENT.YAML:**
```yaml
name: "populist_rhetoric_study"
description: |
  This experiment analyzes populist communication strategies and rhetorical coherence 
  across Donald Trump's presidential speeches using the Cohesive Flourishing Framework 
  v4.4 Tension Enhanced. The corpus includes Trump's 2017 Inaugural Address, his 2017 address to a joint 
  session of Congress, State of the Union addresses (2018-2020), and his 2025 
  address to a joint session of Congress, 
  providing comprehensive coverage of presidential populist rhetoric patterns. The framework's Strategic Contradiction 
  Index (SCI) will reveal the coherence and tension patterns in populist 
  communication strategies.

hypothesis: |
  Trump's presidential rhetoric will demonstrate measurably distinct populist 
  communication patterns characterized by high tension scores between opposing 
  dimensions (Unifying vs Divisive, Individual vs Collective), elevated Strategic 
  Contradiction Index (SCI) scores indicating strategic overreach, and consistent 
  salience patterns emphasizing crisis/threat rhetoric over flourishing/opportunity 
  themes across the presidential tenure.

**FRAMEWORK:** Cohesive Flourishing Framework v4.4 Tension Enhanced - analyzes rhetorical patterns across dimensions like Unifying/Divisive, Individual/Collective, Crisis/Opportunity with Strategic Contradiction Index (SCI) measuring overall tension and strategic coherence in political communication.

**CORPUS:** 6 Trump presidential speeches (all verified existing documents):
- Inaugural Address (2017)
- Address to Joint Session of Congress (2017)
- State of the Union (2018)
- State of the Union (2019)
- State of the Union (2020)
- Address to Joint Session of Congress (2025)

**EVALUATION CRITERIA:**
1. Specification compliance (required fields, testable hypothesis, proper framework-corpus pairing)
2. Analytical coherence (design enables hypothesis testing, appropriate methods, meaningful insights)
3. Technical validity (correct file paths, valid YAML, appropriate model specifications)

Please respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:

"Yes, these documents comply with their specifications and are coherent as a set."

OR

"No, these documents do not comply with their specifications or lack coherence."

If responding "No", briefly explain the specific compliance issues.
