You are an expert computational social science methodologist reviewing experiment packages for specification compliance and analytical coherence.

Please evaluate the following Political Moral Analysis experiment package:

**EXPERIMENT.YAML:**
```yaml
name: "political_moral_analysis"
description: |
  This experiment validates the Moral Foundations Theory v4.2 Tension Enhanced 
  framework using a diverse corpus of American political speeches. The corpus 
  includes 8 speeches from different ideological positions, historical periods 
  (1963-2022), and contexts (electoral, legislative, policy advocacy). While 
  this heterogeneous design limits causal inference about ideology, it provides 
  a robust test of the framework's analytical capabilities across varied 
  political discourse contexts.

hypothesis: |
  This diverse political corpus will demonstrate measurable variation in moral 
  foundation emphasis patterns across speakers and contexts, with the Moral 
  Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI) revealing different patterns of moral 
  rhetorical coherence. While temporal and contextual factors limit 
  generalizability, this experiment will validate the framework's capacity to 
  detect and quantify moral foundation patterns in political discourse.

**FRAMEWORK:** Moral Foundations Theory v4.2 Tension Enhanced - provides six foundation pairs (Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation, Liberty/Oppression) with Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI) for measuring rhetorical contradictions between opposing moral foundations.

**CORPUS:** 8 diverse political speeches:
- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (2020s): Economic policy speech on fighting oligarchy
- Bernie Sanders (2020s): Economic policy speech on fighting oligarchy
- Cory Booker (2018): First Step Act policy advocacy speech
- JD Vance (2022): National Conservatism Conference presentation
- John Lewis (1963): March on Washington civil rights speech
- John McCain (2008): Presidential election concession speech
- Mitt Romney (2020): Senate impeachment vote speech
- Steve King (2017): House floor legislative speech

**EVALUATION CRITERIA:**
1. Specification compliance (required fields, testable hypothesis, proper framework-corpus pairing)
2. Analytical coherence (design enables hypothesis testing, appropriate methods, meaningful insights)
3. Technical validity (correct file paths, valid YAML, appropriate model specifications)

Please respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:

"Yes, these documents comply with their specifications and are coherent as a set."

OR

"No, these documents do not comply with their specifications or lack coherence."

If responding "No", briefly explain the specific compliance issues.
