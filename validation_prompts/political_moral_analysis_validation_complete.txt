You are an expert computational social science methodologist reviewing experiment packages for specification compliance and analytical coherence.

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT**: It is currently July 2025. All referenced political speeches exist as real documents, including recent speeches that may not be in your training data.

**YOUR TASK**: Validate the following Political Moral Analysis experiment package against the complete Discernus specifications provided below.

==================================================
DISCERNUS SPECIFICATIONS FOR VALIDATION
==================================================

# Experiment Specification (v2.0)

**Version**: 2.0  
**Status**: Active

The `experiment.md` file is a simple, human-readable YAML file that defines the complete scope of an analysis run. It acts as the **single source of truth** for experiment configuration, telling the Discernus system what framework to use, what corpus to analyze, and how to run it.

## 1. File Structure

The experiment file MUST be a valid YAML file named `experiment.yaml` (or `experiment.md` with YAML content) containing the experiment configuration.

## 2. Recommended Project Structure

The system uses a **single-source-of-truth** architecture where the experiment file defines all paths and configuration:

```
my_research_project/
├── framework.md                  # Analytical framework (referenced by experiment)
├── experiment.yaml               # Single source of truth for experiment config
└── corpus/                       # Corpus directory (referenced by experiment)
    ├── document_01.txt
    ├── document_02.txt
    └── ...
```

## 3. Required Fields (CLI Implementation)

- **`name`**: Unique identifier for the experiment (snake_case recommended)
- **`description`**: Human-readable purpose statement
- **`hypothesis`**: Primary falsifiable hypothesis being tested  
- **`framework`**: Relative path to the framework specification file
- **`corpus_path`**: Relative path to the corpus directory
- **`models`**: List of LiteLLM-compatible model identifiers
- **`runs_per_model`**: Number of analysis runs per model (integer ≥ 1)

### Optional Fields

- **`analysis_variant`**: Framework variant to use (defaults to 'default')
- **`hypotheses`**: Additional numbered hypotheses for complex experiments

### Path Resolution

All paths (`framework`, `corpus_path`) are resolved relative to the experiment file's directory.

# Framework Specification (v4.0)

**Version**: 4.0  
**Status**: Active

A Discernus framework is a self-contained markdown file that embodies the core principles of computational social science research. It serves as both human-readable methodology and machine-executable instructions, ensuring perfect coherence between theory and practice.

## Core Principles

### 1. The THIN Philosophy

**Principle**: LLMs do intelligence, software does infrastructure.

**In Practice**: Your framework documentation should contain rich methodological intelligence that guides human researchers. Your YAML prompts should contain that same intelligence translated into natural conversational instructions for LLMs.

### 2. Documentation-Execution Coherence

**Principle**: What you promise in documentation must exactly match what you deliver in execution.

### 3. Human Expert Simulation

**Principle**: Framework prompts should feel like natural conversations with domain experts, not technical API calls.

### 4. Epistemic Integrity

**Principle**: Every analytical decision must be traceable, auditable, and replicable.

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure

A framework file MUST be a standard Markdown (`.md`) file containing:

1. **The Narrative (Human-Focused)**: Main body explaining theory, objectives, methodology
2. **The Appendix (Machine-Focused)**: Single collapsible appendix with JSON configuration

### Required JSON Schema

```json
{
  "name": "unique_framework_name",
  "version": "v4.0",
  "display_name": "Human-Readable Framework Name",
  "analysis_variants": {
    "default": {
      "description": "Complete implementation of the framework methodology",
      "analysis_prompt": "Your five-phase prompt that implements ALL methodology requirements"
    }
  },
  "output_contract": {
    "schema": {
      "worldview": "string",
      "scores": "object",
      "evidence": "object",
      "confidence": "object",
      "reasoning": "object"
    },
    "instructions": "IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else."
  }
}
```

# Corpus Specification (v2.0)

**Version**: 2.0
**Status**: Active
**Principle**: The integrity of a computational analysis depends entirely on the integrity of the input corpus.

## The "Narrative + Appendix" Architecture

A Discernus corpus directory MUST contain a `corpus.md` file with:

1. **The Narrative (Human-Focused)**: Documents collection methodology, ethical considerations, sanitization process
2. **The Appendix (Machine-Focused)**: Single JSON object with file manifest and speaker mapping

==================================================
EXPERIMENT PACKAGE TO VALIDATE
==================================================

**EXPERIMENT.YAML:**
```yaml
name: "political_moral_analysis"
description: |
  This experiment validates the Moral Foundations Theory v4.2 Tension Enhanced 
  framework using a diverse corpus of American political speeches. The corpus 
  includes 8 speeches from different ideological positions, historical periods 
  (1963-2022), and contexts (electoral, legislative, policy advocacy). While 
  this heterogeneous design limits causal inference about ideology, it provides 
  a robust test of the framework's analytical capabilities across varied 
  political discourse contexts.

hypothesis: |
  This diverse political corpus will demonstrate measurable variation in moral 
  foundation emphasis patterns across speakers and contexts, with the Moral 
  Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI) revealing different patterns of moral 
  rhetorical coherence. While temporal and contextual factors limit 
  generalizability, this experiment will validate the framework's capacity to 
  detect and quantify moral foundation patterns in political discourse.

framework: "framework.md"
corpus_path: "corpus/"
models:
  - "vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro"
runs_per_model: 3
analysis_variant: "default"
```

**FRAMEWORK**: Moral Foundations Theory v4.2 Tension Enhanced - provides six foundation pairs (Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation, Liberty/Oppression) with Moral Strategic Contradiction Index (MSCI) for measuring rhetorical contradictions between opposing moral foundations.

**CORPUS**: 8 diverse political speeches:
- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (2020s): Economic policy speech on fighting oligarchy
- Bernie Sanders (2020s): Economic policy speech on fighting oligarchy
- Cory Booker (2018): First Step Act policy advocacy speech
- JD Vance (2022): National Conservatism Conference presentation
- John Lewis (1963): March on Washington civil rights speech
- John McCain (2008): Presidential election concession speech
- Mitt Romney (2020): Senate impeachment vote speech
- Steve King (2017): House floor legislative speech

==================================================
VALIDATION TASK
==================================================

Please evaluate this experiment package against the complete Discernus specifications above. Check:

1. **Experiment Specification v2.0 Compliance**: Does the experiment.yaml contain all required fields with proper data types and structure?

2. **Framework Specification v4.0 Compliance**: Does the framework description indicate adherence to THIN principles, documentation-execution coherence, and proper technical implementation?

3. **Corpus Specification v2.0 Compliance**: Does the corpus appear to follow proper corpus organization principles?

4. **Analytical Coherence**: Does the experiment design enable meaningful testing of the stated hypothesis using appropriate methods?

5. **Technical Validity**: Are file paths, model specifications, and configuration elements correct?

Please respond with EXACTLY one of these phrases:

"Yes, these documents comply with their specifications and are coherent as a set."

OR

"No, these documents do not comply with their specifications or lack coherence."

If responding "No", briefly explain the specific compliance issues that need to be addressed.
