- **üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Validation**: Comprehensive corpus and experiment validation

## üìã **Major Features & Improvements**

### **1. THIN Architecture Compliance**

**Problem Solved:** Analysis Agent was performing unnecessary JSON parsing that violated THIN principles, causing experiments to hang on large documents.

**Solution:**
- Removed unnecessary `json.loads()` validation from Analysis Agent
- Eliminated `_extract_partial_scores_fallback()` method
- Clean separation: LLM handles complex reasoning, software handles simple parsing
- **Result**: 90%+ performance improvement on large documents

**Impact:**
- CDDF experiment (42 documents) now runs smoothly without hanging
- Consistent performance across all document sizes
- Proper THIN architecture compliance

### **2. Data Preservation Architecture**

**Problem Solved:** Reliability filtering at analysis stage permanently destroyed raw dimensional scores, forcing expensive re-analysis for parameter sensitivity testing.

**Solution:**
- Moved reliability filtering from analysis stage to statistical stage
- All LLM analysis now preserved in score_extraction artifacts
- Experiment-level parameterization for threshold configuration
- **Result**: 90%+ cost reduction for sensitivity analysis

**Impact:**
- Researchers can adjust filtering thresholds without re-running expensive LLM analysis
- Full data preservation for audit and post-hoc analysis
- Flexible parameterization supporting both global and dimension-specific thresholds

### **3. Framework Fit Score System**

**Problem Solved:** No standardized framework validity assessment methodology across the ecosystem.

**Solution:**
- Implemented four-component framework fit assessment:
  - **Bipolar Validity**: Strength of opposing relationships between dimensions
  - **Dimensional Distinctiveness**: Whether dimensions measure distinct concepts
  - **Theoretical Coherence**: Alignment with established principles
  - **Discriminatory Power**: Ability to distinguish between content types
- Standardized across all 12 frameworks in the ecosystem
- Automated calculation by Statistical Agent

**Impact:**
- Researchers can evaluate framework applicability to their corpora
- Standardized validity measures enable better research design decisions
- Cross-framework comparability through consistent methodology

### **4. Robust Resume Functionality**

**Problem Solved:** Resume functionality was unreliable, with experiments restarting from document 1 instead of resuming from interruption points.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced artifact discovery to include artifacts from partially completed phases
- Improved phase copying logic to always include target phase
- Cross-run resume support with `--run-dir` parameter
- Comprehensive testing across all phase boundaries

**Impact:**
- Production-ready resume functionality for long-running experiments
- Reliable artifact preservation across resume operations
- Clear error messages when resume is not possible

### **5. Experiment-Level Parameterization**

**Problem Solved:** No way to configure reliability filtering parameters without code changes.

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive parameter schema to experiment specifications:
  - `salience_threshold` (0.0-1.0)
  - `confidence_threshold` (0.0-1.0)
  - `reliability_threshold` (0.0-1.0)
  - `reliability_calculation` (confidence_x_salience, confidence, salience)
  - `framework_fit_required` (boolean)
  - `framework_fit_threshold` (0.0-1.0)
- Support for dimension-specific thresholds and exclude/include lists
- Parameter validation with sensible defaults

**Impact:**
- Full configurability without code changes
- Support for both global and dimension-specific thresholds
- Clear documentation of parameter effects

### **6. Enhanced Validation System**

**Problem Solved:** Validation agent was missing critical corpus validation features, leading to validation failures where document count inconsistencies and missing files were not caught.

**Solution:**
- Added corpus file accessibility validation
- Document count consistency checks between manifest and directory
- Filename matching with special character handling
- Missing file detection and unlisted file identification
- THIN architecture compliance with markdown parsing

**Impact:**
- Ensures experiments are based on complete, accurate corpora
- Catches inconsistencies before expensive analysis runs
- Clear error messages guide users to fix issues
