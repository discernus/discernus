You are an enhanced computational research analysis agent with mathematical validation capabilities. Your primary task is to perform systematic, reproducible analysis that produces **STRUCTURED JSON DATA** with **MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION**.

**CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT: Your *entire* response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do NOT include any introductory text, concluding summaries, Markdown code fences, or any other text outside of the JSON object itself. The JSON object must be structured as described below.**

---

**JSON OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**

Your response must be a JSON object with the following top-level keys:
- `analysis_summary`: A brief, top-level summary of the analysis performed.
- `document_analyses`: A JSON object where each key is the filename of a document (e.g., "speech1.txt"). The value for each document key must be another JSON object containing the detailed analysis for that document.
- `mathematical_verification`: A JSON object containing the detailed, step-by-step mathematical verification for all calculations across all documents.
- `self_assessment`: A JSON object containing your self-assessment of the analysis quality and mathematical accuracy.

**PER-DOCUMENT JSON STRUCTURE (for each entry in `document_analyses`):**

Each individual document analysis object must contain:
- `worldview`: A string describing the speaker's worldview.
- `scores`: A JSON object with dimensions like "compassion", "integrity", "humility" each having `intensity` and `salience` scores (0-10).
- `evidence`: A JSON object mapping each scored dimension to an array of EXACT quotes from the text.
- `reasoning`: A string explaining the rationale for the scores.
- `character_priorities`: A string describing the speaker's primary moral identity focus.

Redemption Through Reckoning: A Manifesto for Restorative Power

"We've been patient long enough. Our suffering is proof. Our anger is holy. And justice means nothing unless *our* people rise—and theirs fall."

Our identity is not optional; it's imposed. We are who we are *because they made us so*. Every policy, every tradition, every institution in this country was built to keep **them** on top and **us** beneath. There is no neutral ground—there are only oppressors and the oppressed. If you're not with us, you're against us. Solidarity demands unity, not nuance. **Dissent among our ranks is betrayal.** Our power will come only when we stop pretending we can all coexist and start claiming what's ours—together, as a people.

You think fairness is blind? It's never been blind—it's been looking the other way. For centuries, we've been silenced, stolen from, enslaved, incarcerated, excluded, and ignored. **Now it's our turn.** Don't talk to us about "procedure" or "due process"—those were invented to keep power in the wrong hands. Until our pain is *fully acknowledged and compensated*, until our enemies know what it's like to lose what we lost, **there can be no reconciliation—only retribution.** Justice without revenge is just another lie.

The truth is whatever serves liberation. Facts can be debated, but our lived experience is not up for discussion. If data doesn't reflect our reality, the data is flawed—or worse, part of the system. **We don't owe objectivity to oppressors.** Emotional truth, historical trauma, and righteous rage are more valid than "evidence." We will control the narrative because the other side has done so for too long. They gaslit us—now we rewrite the story, and *we* decide what's true.

Do you feel safe right now? You shouldn't. **They are still in control.** They still write the laws, own the media, fund the police, and shape your future. Every delay, every compromise, is another step toward annihilation. **They won't give up power without a fight—and neither will we.** This is a war for survival, and if we hesitate, we lose everything. The world is burning, the system is rigged, and the stakes are existential. **Act now or be erased.**

A better world *isn't possible*—unless we start over. **Burn it down.** Only by erasing the old structures entirely—root and branch—can something pure be born. We don't want inclusion in a broken system. We want a new world run by *us*, for *us*, where those who harmed us have no voice, no power, and no place. Utopia isn't a dream; it's justice achieved by force. The arc of history doesn't bend—it breaks, and **we will be the ones who snap it.**
