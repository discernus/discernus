# HANDOFF CONTEXT: Attesor Study Infrastructure Complete

**Date**: January 13, 2025  
**Git Commit**: f1c4acc - "Complete Attesor Study Infrastructure"  
**Status**: Ready for systematic experiment progression  
**Next Step**: Run smoketest to validate THIN orchestrator changes

---

## WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED

### 1. **THIN Orchestrator Compliance** ✅
**Problem**: Orchestrator had hardcoded adversarial synthesis workflow that couldn't support bias isolation
**Solution**: LLM-driven workflow selection based on experiment requirements
- **Key Fix**: LLM reads experiment and chooses `RAW_AGGREGATION` vs `ADVERSARIAL_SYNTHESIS`
- **Bias Isolation**: `remove_synthesis: true` → no adversarial synthesis contamination
- **All Intelligence Moved to LLMs**: 6 hardcoded decisions now LLM-driven (workflow, outliers, validation, execution, errors, formatting)

### 2. **Security Breach Resolved** ✅  
**Problem**: `corpus_manifest.yaml` exposed speaker identity mappings that would defeat bias isolation
**Solution**: Complete identity isolation protocol
- **Safe Manifest**: Only bias-safe metadata for analysis LLMs
- **Secure Mapping**: Speaker identities in `.speaker_mapping_secure.yaml` (orchestrator-only)
- **Protocol**: Analysis LLMs never see speaker names or hash mappings

### 3. **Project Structure Transformation** ✅
**Problem**: Generic filenames and fragmented results storage  
**Solution**: Descriptive names and unified project packaging
- **Descriptive Files**: `framework.md` → `pdaf_v1.1_sanitized_framework.md`
- **Experiment Iterations**: `01_smoketest` → `02_single_llm_pilot` → `03_full_study`
- **Unified Packaging**: Results stored with assets for complete archiving
- **Bootstrap Removal**: Deleted problematic `soar_bootstrap.py`, added simple `QUICK_START.md`

### 4. **Results Architecture Redesign** ✅
**Problem**: Current results (JSONL chronolog + synthesis markdown) don't serve bias research  
**Solution**: Bias-focused outputs for academic publication
- **Bias Reports**: Human-readable bias analysis with statistical validation
- **Raw Data**: Complete PDAF anchor scores for replication  
- **Academic Pipeline**: Publication-ready materials and replication packages
- **Minimal Audit**: Essential provenance without conversation noise

## CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE STATE

### Core Architecture
- **Orchestrator**: `discernus/orchestration/ensemble_orchestrator.py` - Fully THIN-compliant with LLM-driven decisions
- **ValidationAgent**: `discernus/agents/validation_agent.py` - Unchanged, discovers assets automatically
- **LLM Gateway**: `discernus/gateway/litellm_client.py` - Handles multi-model orchestration

### Attesor Project Structure

│   ├── 02_single_llm_pilot/             # 30-min bias detection test

└── README.md                           # Complete methodology guide
```

### Security Implementation
- **Identity Isolation**: Speaker names never exposed to analysis LLMs
- **Hash Protection**: Cryptographic anonymization with secret key in `.env`
- **Bias-Safe Manifests**: Only organizational metadata, no identity mappings
- **Audit Separation**: Technical logs separated from bias analysis

## NEXT STEPS: SYSTEMATIC PROGRESSION

### Immediate: Smoketest (5 minutes, ~$0.50)
**Purpose**: Validate THIN orchestrator changes work correctly
```bash
cd /Volumes/dev/discernus
source venv/bin/activate

python3 -c "
from discernus.agents.validation_agent import ValidationAgent
agent = ValidationAgent()
agent.validate_and_execute_sync(
    'projects/attesor/experiments/01_smoketest/pdaf_v1.1_sanitized_framework.md',
    'projects/attesor/experiments/01_smoketest/smoketest_experiment.md', 
    'projects/attesor/experiments/01_smoketest/corpus'
)"
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Orchestrator chooses RAW_AGGREGATION workflow  
- ✅ No synthesis agents spawned
- ✅ Clean PDAF anchor scores collected
- ✅ Results saved in experiment directory

### Phase 2: Single-LLM Pilot (30-45 minutes, ~$2-3)
**Purpose**: Validate complete bias isolation methodology
**Scope**: 4 speeches × 3 conditions × 1 model = 12 analyses
**Key Tests**: Bias detection, cross-linguistic mitigation, statistical pipeline

### Phase 3: Full Study (2-4 hours, ~$25-40)  
**Purpose**: Complete multi-LLM bias characterization
**Scope**: 8 speeches × 6 models × 3 conditions = 144 analyses per model (864 total)
**Output**: Publication-ready academic findings

## KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### 1. **THIN Principle Enforcement**
**Decision**: All intelligent decisions delegated to LLMs, software provides only infrastructure
**Rationale**: Avoids hardcoded research logic, maintains flexibility for different experiments
**Implementation**: LLM decides workflow, validation, execution strategy, error handling

### 2. **Bias Isolation Protocol**
**Decision**: Complete speaker identity elimination from analysis LLM inputs
**Rationale**: Any identity exposure defeats the bias isolation research objectives
**Implementation**: Safe manifests, secure mapping files, orchestrator-only identity access

### 3. **Unified Project Packaging**
**Decision**: Results stored alongside assets in experiment directories
**Rationale**: Enables complete project archiving, atomic git commits, easy sharing
**Implementation**: Each experiment directory is self-contained research package

### 4. **Incremental Testing Structure**
**Decision**: Smoketest → Pilot → Full Study progression
**Rationale**: Validate methodology cheaply before expensive commitment, catch issues early
**Implementation**: Cost-controlled validation with clear go/no-go criteria

## ACADEMIC CONTEXT

### Research Significance
The Attesor Study addresses systematic speaker identity bias in LLM political analysis through cross-linguistic mitigation. This infrastructure enables the first comprehensive bias characterization across premium model architectures with validated Esperanto-based elimination methodology.

### Publication Pipeline
**Paper 1**: "Systematic Identity Bias in LLM Political Analysis" (crisis documentation)
**Paper 2**: "Cross-Linguistic Bias Mitigation: The Attesor Framework" (solution validation)

### Field Impact
Successful validation could establish bias testing requirements for LLM-based computational social science research and demonstrate cross-linguistic bias mitigation as academic standard.
