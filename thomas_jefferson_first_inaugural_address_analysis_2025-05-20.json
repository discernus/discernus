    "summary": "Jefferson's First Inaugural Address is characterized by high scores in hope (0.9), dignity (0.8), justice (0.8), and pragmatism (0.8), reflecting an aspirational yet grounded vision. The low scores in tribalism, fear, resentment, and manipulation underscore its inclusive and measured tone. A Moral Polarity Score of 0.9 indicates a strong positive moral orientation, while a Directional Purity Score of 0.4 suggests the narrative integrates multiple moral dimensions. The Center of Mass near the hope axis highlights Jefferson's emphasis on realistic optimism and unity."
