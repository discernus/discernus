# Three Wells Political Discourse Framework

## Overview

The Three Wells Political Discourse framework models contemporary political discourse (2010-present) through three competing gravitational wells that transcend traditional left-right categories: **Intersectionality Theory**, **Tribal Domination Theory**, and **Pluralist Individual Dignity Theory**.

## Framework Type

**Independent Wells** - These three theories represent fundamentally incompatible worldviews about human nature, social organization, and political legitimacy. Unlike traditional political spectrums, these are not opposite pairs but competing gravitational forces that attract political discourse.

## Historical Context

This framework emerges from the collapse of the 20th century **Classical Liberal-Communist-Fascist Triangle** (1900-1989). After 1989, new gravitational forces emerged organized around **identity, dignity, and belonging** questions rather than traditional economic redistribution.

### Evolution of Political Gravitational Wells
- **20th Century**: Economic/state-focused (Classical Liberalism, Communism, Fascism)
- **21st Century**: Identity/dignity-focused (Intersectionality, Tribal Domination, Pluralist Dignity)

## The Three Wells

### Intersectionality Theory (0°)
- **Core Focus**: Multiple overlapping identity categories and systemic oppression analysis
- **Key Principles**: Group-based remedies, structural inequality focus, demographic representation
- **Historical Context**: Evolution from 20th century communism's class-based analysis to identity-based oppression analysis
- **Recognition Pattern**: Emphasis on lived experience, marginalized communities, targeted programs

### Tribal Domination Theory (120°)
- **Core Focus**: In-group loyalty and out-group exclusion with flexible tribal boundaries
- **Key Principles**: Group supremacy, dominance seeking, loyalty over universal principles
- **Historical Context**: Evolution of 20th century fascist themes with flexible boundaries (ethnic, religious, ideological, cultural)
- **Recognition Pattern**: Us-versus-them rhetoric, exclusionary practices, cultural purity emphasis

### Pluralist Individual Dignity Theory (240°)
- **Core Focus**: Universal human dignity and cross-group cooperation
- **Key Principles**: Individual moral agency, merit-based institutions, pluralistic inclusion
- **Historical Context**: Synthesis addressing classical liberalism's failures while maintaining individual dignity commitment
- **Recognition Pattern**: Shared humanity emphasis, merit-based evaluation, civic cooperation

## Key Theoretical Insight

These represent **independent competing theories**, not dipole oppositions. Contemporary politics is organized around fundamental disagreements about:
- Whether individuals should be understood primarily through group membership or as autonomous agents
- Whether social organization should be particularistic (group-specific) or universalistic (all people)
- Whether institutions should promote integration or maintain group boundaries

## Framework Applications

### Contemporary Political Analysis
- **Presidential speeches** and campaign rhetoric
- **Social movement** discourse and organizing
- **Policy debates** and legislative language
- **Media coverage** and political commentary
- **International relations** and diplomatic discourse

### Research Questions
- How do political narratives show gravitational attraction to different theories?
- Which theoretical assumptions drive specific policy positions?
- How do politicians navigate between competing gravitational wells?
- What are the long-term implications for democratic governance?

## Framework-Specific Metrics

- **Gravitational Pull Strength**: Total magnitude of theoretical forces across all wells
- **Theoretical Coherence Score**: Consistency with single theoretical framework vs. mixed pulls
- **Center of Mass**: Overall positioning across the three competing worldviews

## Analytical Approach

### Independent Wells Recognition
- Narratives can show attraction to **multiple wells simultaneously**
- Scores represent **gravitational pull strength**, not presence/absence
- **Center of mass** shows overall theoretical orientation
- **No dipole oppositions** - these are competing alternatives

### Key Analytical Questions
1. Does the narrative organize around group identity and systemic oppression?
2. Does it emphasize in-group loyalty and out-group exclusion?
3. Does it focus on universal dignity and cross-group cooperation?
4. Which assumptions about human nature drive the discourse?
5. How are individuals positioned - as group representatives or autonomous agents?

## Contemporary Relevance

This framework explains seemingly contradictory political phenomena:
- **Cross-cutting coalitions** that defy traditional left-right analysis
- **Identity politics** emergence across the political spectrum
- **Populist movements** combining different theoretical elements
- **Institutional capture** by competing worldviews
- **Democratic polarization** as natural result of theoretical competition

## Comparison to Historical Framework

| Aspect | 20th Century Triangle | Contemporary Three Wells |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Focus** | Economic/state organization | Identity/dignity/belonging |
| **Primary Question** | How should economy be organized? | How should individuals relate to groups? |
| **Collapse Event** | 1989 - End of Soviet communism | TBD - Framework still active |
| **Institutional Impact** | Revolutionary replacement | Institutional capture/redirection |

## Usage Examples

### Political Speech Analysis
```
Barack Obama 2008: Strong Pluralist Individual Dignity pull
"There is not a liberal America and a conservative America... there is the United States of America"

Donald Trump 2016: Strong Tribal Domination pull  
"Make America Great Again" with us-versus-them framing

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Strong Intersectionality pull
Emphasis on systemic inequality and group-based representation
```

### Policy Debate Analysis
- **Healthcare**: Different wells approach through different lenses (universal coverage vs. group-specific programs vs. tribal/national preference)
- **Immigration**: Intersectionality (refugee/asylum focus), Tribal Domination (border security), Pluralist Dignity (merit-based systems)
- **Education**: Different approaches to achievement gaps, curriculum, and institutional design

This framework provides a more accurate map of contemporary political terrain than traditional ideological categories, explaining the gravitational dynamics that organize modern political discourse.
