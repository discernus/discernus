# Historical Ideological Triangle Framework

## Overview

The Historical Ideological Triangle framework models the three competing ideological systems that defined 20th century political discourse (1900-1989): **Classical Liberalism**, **Communism**, and **Fascism**.

## Framework Type

**Independent Wells** - These three ideologies represent fundamentally incompatible worldviews that competed for dominance, not dipole oppositions. Each created its own "gravitational pull" attracting movements, policies, and rhetoric.

## The Three Wells

### Classical Liberalism (0°)
- **Core Focus**: Individual rights, limited government, market economics
- **Key Principles**: Natural rights, constitutional governance, voluntary exchange
- **Historical Context**: Enlightenment principles, but with "profoundly wretched historical record" of colonial violence and exploitation

### Communism (120°) 
- **Core Focus**: Collective ownership and class-based analysis
- **Key Principles**: Historical materialism, revolutionary transformation, international solidarity
- **Historical Context**: Marx and Engels' critique of both liberalism and nationalism, focusing on economic relations as fundamental

### Fascism (240°)
- **Core Focus**: State supremacy with organic nationalism
- **Key Principles**: Authoritarian leadership, ethnic identity, rejection of both liberalism and communism
- **Historical Context**: Reaction against both liberal democracy and socialist internationalism

## Key Historical Insight

All three frameworks viewed **Classical Liberalism as their greatest threat** - a crucial dynamic that shaped 20th century politics.

## Framework Collapse

This ideological triangle collapsed in **1989** with the end of Soviet communism, creating space for the contemporary Three Wells Model (Intersectionality Theory, Tribal Domination Theory, Pluralist Individual Dignity Theory).

## Applications

- Analyzing historical political texts (1900-1989)
- Understanding ideological evolution and transitions
- Comparing 20th century vs. contemporary political dynamics
- Research on political ideologies and intellectual history

## Framework-Specific Metrics

- **Ideological Purity Score**: Consistency with single ideological system
- **Historical Coherence Score**: Alignment with documented historical expressions
- **Center of Mass**: Overall positioning across the three competing worldviews
