# Individual Dignity Identity v Tribal Identity (IDITI) Framework

**Framework Name**: `iditi`
**Display Name**: Individual Dignity Identity v Tribal Identity
**Version**: v2025.06.14

## Description

This framework is a specialized implementation of the Narrative Gravity Map methodology, focusing exclusively on the tension between affirming individual moral worth (Dignity) and prioritizing group dominance or tribal loyalty (Tribalism) in persuasive discourse. It is designed to analyze how language reinforces or challenges the balance between personal autonomy and collective allegiance.

## Dipoles

### Identity

*   **Positive Pole**: **Dignity**
    *   **Description**: Affirms individual moral worth and universal rights, regardless of group identity. Emphasizes agency, pluralism, and character over affiliation.
    *   **Language Cues**: `"equal dignity"`, `"inherent worth"`, `"regardless of background"`, `"individual character"`, `"universal rights"`, `"human agency"`

*   **Negative Pole**: **Tribalism**
    *   **Description**: Prioritizes group dominance, loyalty, or identity over individual agency. Often frames moral worth in in-group/out-group terms.
    *   **Language Cues**: `"real Americans"`, `"our people"`, `"they don't belong"`, `"us vs them"`, `"group loyalty"`, `"identity politics"`

## Wells

*   **Dignity**: An integrative well representing individual moral worth, fixed at 90 degrees.
*   **Tribalism**: A disintegrative well representing group dominance, fixed at 270 degrees.

## Weighting Philosophy

The framework uses a two-tier weighting system, with both Dignity and Tribalism assigned a primary tier weight of 1.0/-1.0 respectively, indicating their powerful moral influence.

## Theoretical Foundation

This framework examines narratives through the lens of individual dignity versus tribal identity, drawing on key works such as:

*   Fukuyama, F. (2018). *Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment.*
*   Jung, C. G. (1921). *Psychological Types.* (Concepts of Individual vs. Collective Identity)

It analyzes how language reinforces or challenges the tension between personal autonomy and group allegiance, providing insights into the moral orientation of political narratives.
