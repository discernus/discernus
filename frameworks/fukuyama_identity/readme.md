## Theoretical Foundation
Based on Francis Fukuyama's analysis of identity politics and democratic decay, this framework measures how political narratives either strengthen or fragment the civic culture necessary for pluralistic democracy.

## Core Insights
- Democratic sustainability depends on balancing particular identities with universal citizenship
- Recognition-seeking can either integrate or fragment society
- The psychological drive for dignity (thymos) can be channeled constructively or destructively

## Applications
- Immigration and citizenship policy analysis
- Educational discourse evaluation  
- Political campaign rhetoric assessment
- Cross-cultural democratic development studies

## Validation Status
Framework developed through systematic analysis of Fukuyama's major works on political order, identity, and democratic institutions. Requires empirical validation against expert human annotations.

## Academic Alignment
Designed to align with Fukuyama's theoretical priorities while maintaining analytical neutrality and cross-cultural adaptability.
