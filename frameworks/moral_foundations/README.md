# Moral Foundations Framework

## Overview

This is the original 5-dipole moral psychology framework based on Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory, adapted for political and ethical text analysis through the Moral Gravity Wells approach.

## Theoretical Basis

### Core Concept
Moral judgments emerge from competing psychological forces that can be modeled as dipolar tensions. Each dipole represents a fundamental dimension of moral reasoning, with integrative forces promoting social cohesion and disintegrative forces undermining it.

### Dipole Structure

**Primary Tier (Weight: 1.0)**
- **Identity Dipole**: Dignity vs Tribalism
  - Most powerful moral motivators according to Haidt research
  - Core to group membership and individual worth

**Secondary Tier (Weight: 0.8)**  
- **Integrity Dipole**: Truth vs Manipulation
- **Fairness Dipole**: Justice vs Resentment
  - Universalizable principles that transcend group membership
  - Cognitive rather than purely emotional

**Tertiary Tier (Weight: 0.6)**
- **Aspiration Dipole**: Hope vs Fantasy  
- **Stability Dipole**: Pragmatism vs Fear
  - "Cool" cognitive processes, easily overridden by stronger forces
  - Moderate and contextual rather than absolute

## Mathematical Model

### Elliptical Coordinate System
- **Semi-major axis**: 1.0 (vertical)
- **Semi-minor axis**: 0.7 (horizontal)  
- **Scaling factor**: 0.8 (overall system scaling)

### Well Positions (Degrees)
- **Dignity**: 90° (top, +Y axis)
- **Truth**: 45° (upper right)
- **Hope**: 20° (right, near +X axis)
- **Justice**: 135° (upper left)  
- **Pragmatism**: 160° (left, near -X axis)
- **Tribalism**: 270° (bottom, -Y axis)
- **Fear**: 200° (lower left)
- **Resentment**: 225° (lower left)
- **Manipulation**: 315° (lower right)
- **Fantasy**: 340° (lower right)

## Usage

This framework is designed for:
- **Political speech analysis** - Understanding moral appeals in campaign rhetoric
- **Policy debate analysis** - Mapping moral arguments in policy discussions  
- **Cross-cultural comparison** - Comparing moral emphasis across different societies
- **Historical analysis** - Tracking moral themes across time periods

## Validation

The framework has been tested on:
- Nelson Mandela's 1994 Inaugural Address
- Hugo Chávez's 2006 Presidential Speech
- Various political manifestos and policy documents

Results show clear differentiation between integrative and disintegrative moral orientations, with metrics correlating with expected political and ethical patterns.
