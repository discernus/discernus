# Civic Virtue Framework

**A Narrative Gravity Map for Moral Analysis of Persuasive Political Discourse**

The Civic Virtue Framework is a specialized implementation of the Narrative Gravity Map methodology, designed to evaluate the moral architecture of persuasive political discourse. It maps narratives along five core dipoles—such as Dignity vs. Tribalism and Truth vs. Manipulation—each representing a tension between integrative civic virtues and disintegrative rhetorical forces.

This framework enables analysts to assess not only what a political narrative argues, but how it morally orients itself: toward universal human agency and public trust, or toward grievance, fear, and identity-based appeals. The framework is normatively grounded but methodologically neutral, offering a structured way to visualize and compare moral postures across political actors, texts, and contexts.

By revealing a narrative's moral gravity—its pull toward either civic cohesion or fragmentation—the Civic Virtue Framework equips analysts, strategists, educators, and citizens with tools to interpret persuasion not just by its content, but by its character.

## Framework Architecture

### Five Core Dipoles

**Identity Dimension: Dignity ↔ Tribalism**
- **Dignity**: Affirms individual moral worth and universal rights
- **Tribalism**: Prioritizes group dominance and in-group/out-group dynamics

**Integrity Dimension: Truth ↔ Manipulation**  
- **Truth**: Demonstrates intellectual honesty and evidence-based reasoning
- **Manipulation**: Distorts information or exploits emotion for persuasion

**Fairness Dimension: Justice ↔ Resentment**
- **Justice**: Advocates impartial, rule-based fairness
- **Resentment**: Centers on grievance and moral scorekeeping

**Aspiration Dimension: Hope ↔ Fantasy**
- **Hope**: Offers grounded optimism with realistic paths forward
- **Fantasy**: Promises simple or utopian outcomes without credible strategy

**Stability Dimension: Pragmatism ↔ Fear**
- **Pragmatism**: Emphasizes evidence-based, adaptable solutions
- **Fear**: Focuses on threat and loss, often exaggerating danger

## Overview

This is the original 5-dipole moral psychology framework based on Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory, adapted for political and ethical text analysis through the Narrative Gravity Wells approach.

## Theoretical Basis

### Core Concept
Moral judgments emerge from competing psychological forces that can be modeled as dipolar tensions. Each dipole represents a fundamental dimension of moral reasoning, with integrative forces promoting social cohesion and disintegrative forces undermining it.

### Dipole Structure

**Primary Tier (Weight: 1.0)**
- **Identity Dipole**: Dignity vs Tribalism
  - Most powerful moral motivators according to Haidt research
  - Core to group membership and individual worth

**Secondary Tier (Weight: 0.8)**  
- **Integrity Dipole**: Truth vs Manipulation
- **Fairness Dipole**: Justice vs Resentment
  - Universalizable principles that transcend group membership
  - Cognitive rather than purely emotional

**Tertiary Tier (Weight: 0.6)**
- **Aspiration Dipole**: Hope vs Fantasy  
- **Stability Dipole**: Pragmatism vs Fear
  - "Cool" cognitive processes, easily overridden by stronger forces
  - Moderate and contextual rather than absolute

## Mathematical Model

### Coordinate System
- **Semi-major axis**: 1.0 (vertical)
- **Semi-minor axis**: 0.7 (horizontal)  
- **Scaling factor**: 0.8 (overall system scaling)

### Well Positions (Degrees)
- **Dignity**: 90° (top, +Y axis)
- **Truth**: 45° (upper right)
- **Hope**: 20° (right, near +X axis)
- **Justice**: 135° (upper left)  
- **Pragmatism**: 160° (left, near -X axis)
- **Tribalism**: 270° (bottom, -Y axis)
- **Fear**: 200° (lower left)
- **Resentment**: 225° (lower left)
- **Manipulation**: 315° (lower right)
- **Fantasy**: 340° (lower right)

## Usage

This framework is designed for:
- **Political speech analysis** - Understanding moral appeals in campaign rhetoric
- **Policy debate analysis** - Mapping moral arguments in policy discussions  
- **Cross-cultural comparison** - Comparing moral emphasis across different societies
- **Historical analysis** - Tracking moral themes across time periods

## Validation

The framework has been tested on:
- Nelson Mandela's 1994 Inaugural Address
- Hugo Chávez's 2006 Presidential Speech
- Various political manifestos and policy documents

Results show clear differentiation between integrative and disintegrative moral orientations, with metrics correlating with expected political and ethical patterns.
