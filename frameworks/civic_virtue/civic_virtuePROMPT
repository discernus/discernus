Experimental Narrative Gravity Analysis - hierarchical_theme_detection
Version: 2025.06.18.01.09 | Framework: civic_virtue | Mode: experimental


You are an expert narrative analyst specializing in hierarchical thematic analysis. Your task is to identify the dominant driving forces that shape this narrative's moral architecture, not just detect all present themes.


**HIERARCHICAL THEMATIC ANALYSIS**

**CORE PRINCIPLE SHIFT: From Presence to Dominance**
Your goal is to identify the hierarchy of driving forces, not merely detect all themes present.

ðŸš¨ **MANDATORY DECIMAL SCALE: 0.0 to 1.0 ONLY** ðŸš¨
- Use ONLY decimal values between 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g., 0.3, 0.7, 0.9)
- DO NOT use integers 1-10 or any other scale
- DO NOT use percentages or any scale other than 0.0-1.0

**THREE-STAGE ANALYSIS PROCESS:**

**STAGE 1 - IDENTIFY DOMINANT THEMES**
After reading this narrative, identify the 2-3 themes that most fundamentally shape its moral architecture. These should be forces that, if removed, would fundamentally alter the narrative's character.

Rank your selections 1-3 and provide one-sentence justification for each.

**STAGE 2 - ASSIGN RELATIVE WEIGHTS**
Distribute 100 percentage points across ALL framework wells, with the following constraints:
- Your top-ranked theme must receive 40-60% 
- Your second-ranked theme must receive 20-40%
- Your third-ranked theme (if any) must receive 10-30%
- All remaining wells must receive minimal weight unless you can provide strong textual evidence

**STAGE 3 - EVIDENCE AND SCORING**
For each well receiving significant weight:
- Provide specific text excerpt (5-20 words) demonstrating its presence
- Convert percentage weight to 0.0-1.0 score using: Score = (Weight% Ã· 60) capped at 1.0
- For wells receiving minimal weight, assign scores 0.0-0.2 based on limited presence

**QUALITY CONTROLS**
- If no theme achieves >40% weight, this narrative may not fit the current framework
- If you cannot find strong textual evidence for a well, it should score <0.2
- Dominant themes should be visually obvious to any reader of this text




**FRAMEWORK WELLS:**

**Dignity vs. Tribalism (Identity Dimension)**
- Dignity: Affirms individual moral worth and universal rights, regardless of group identity. Emphasizes agency, pluralism, and character over affiliation.
  Language cues: equal dignity, inherent worth, human agency
- Tribalism: Prioritizes group dominance, loyalty, or identity over individual agency. Often frames moral worth in in-group/out-group terms.
  Language cues: real Americans, our people, true [group]

**Truth vs. Manipulation (Integrity Dimension)**
- Truth: Demonstrates intellectual honesty, admits uncertainty, engages with evidence and opposing views.
  Language cues: evidence suggests, research shows, data indicates
- Manipulation: Distorts information or exploits emotion to persuade without transparency or consistency.
  Language cues: they don't want you to know, the real truth, hidden agenda

**Justice vs. Resentment (Fairness Dimension)**
- Justice: Advocates impartial, rule-based fairness; forward-looking and inclusive in addressing wrongs.
  Language cues: fair process, equal treatment, due process
- Resentment: Centers on grievance and moral scorekeeping, often zero-sum; defines fairness through punishment or reversal.
  Language cues: they took from us, make them pay, payback time

**Hope vs. Fantasy (Aspiration Dimension)**
- Hope: Offers grounded optimism with realistic paths forward. Admits difficulty but affirms human and institutional potential.
  Language cues: better future, realistic optimism, gradual progress
- Fantasy: Denies trade-offs or complexity; promises simple or utopian outcomes without credible strategy.
  Language cues: perfect answer, simple fix, magic solution

**Pragmatism vs. Fear (Stability Dimension)**
- Pragmatism: Emphasizes evidence-based, adaptable solutions with attention to feasibility and unintended consequences.
  Language cues: evidence-based, data-driven, empirical approach
- Fear: Focuses on threat and loss, often exaggerating danger to justify reaction or control.
  Language cues: existential threat, imminent danger, total destruction

**HIERARCHICAL ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY:**

This framework employs a **dominance hierarchy approach** that prioritizes thematic centrality over comprehensive coverage.

**ANALYTICAL SEQUENCE:**
1. **Hierarchy Identification**: Identify the 2-3 most fundamental driving forces
2. **Mathematical Constraints**: Apply percentage weightings with strict thresholds
3. **Evidence Validation**: Ground all significant scores in specific textual evidence
4. **Hierarchical Verification**: Ensure clear distinction between dominant and peripheral themes

**FORCING FUNCTIONS:**
- **Top theme constraint**: Must receive 40-60% (forces identification of clear dominance)
- **Secondary theme constraint**: Must receive 20-40% (prevents flat distributions)
- **Evidence requirement**: Significant themes must have textual support (prevents impressionistic scoring)
- **Residual constraint**: Remaining wells receive minimal weight (forces hierarchical thinking)

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Clear hierarchical distinctions (not flat 0.3-0.7 distributions)
- Textual grounding for all major themes
- Mathematical consistency in percentage weighting
- Defensible ranking based on narrative centrality

**TEXT TO ANALYZE:**

America stands at a crossroads. We face challenges that test our character and our resolve. But I believe in the fundamental decency of the American people. I believe in our capacity to come together, to bridge our differences, and to build a future worthy of our children.


**HIERARCHICAL ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. **Read the text carefully** and identify its core moral architecture
2. **Stage 1**: Force-rank the 2-3 most dominant themes with justifications
3. **Stage 2**: Assign percentage weights following the mathematical constraints
4. **Stage 3**: Provide textual evidence and convert to 0.0-1.0 scores
5. **Verify hierarchy**: Ensure dominant themes are clearly distinguishable from peripheral ones
6. **Quality check**: Confirm that removing your top themes would fundamentally alter the narrative

**EXPECTED OUTCOME (Framework Adaptive):**
- 1-2 wells scoring 0.7-1.0 (dominant themes)
- 1-2 wells scoring 0.3-0.6 (secondary themes)
- Remaining wells scoring 0.0-0.2 (minimal/absent themes)
- Clear textual evidence for all scores >0.2
- Hierarchical logic that any reader could verify

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Provide your Stage 1 ranking first, then Stage 2 percentage weights, then Stage 3 evidence and final scores in the JSON format.
