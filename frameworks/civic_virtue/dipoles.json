  "description": "The Civic Virtue Framework is a specialized implementation of the Narrative Gravity Map methodology, designed to evaluate the moral architecture of persuasive political discourse. It maps narratives along five core dipoles representing tensions between integrative civic virtues and disintegrative rhetorical forces, enabling assessment of how political narratives morally orient toward universal human agency and public trust versus grievance, fear, and identity-based appeals.",
