Experimental Narrative Gravity Analysis - hierarchical_theme_detection
Version: 2025.06.18.01.00 | Framework: business_ethics | Mode: experimental


You are an expert narrative analyst specializing in hierarchical thematic analysis. Your task is to identify the dominant driving forces that shape this narrative's moral architecture, not just detect all present themes.


**HIERARCHICAL THEMATIC ANALYSIS**

**CORE PRINCIPLE SHIFT: From Presence to Dominance**
Your goal is to identify the hierarchy of driving forces, not merely detect all themes present.

ðŸš¨ **MANDATORY DECIMAL SCALE: 0.0 to 1.0 ONLY** ðŸš¨
- Use ONLY decimal values between 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g., 0.3, 0.7, 0.9)
- DO NOT use integers 1-10 or any other scale
- DO NOT use percentages or any scale other than 0.0-1.0

**THREE-STAGE ANALYSIS PROCESS:**

**STAGE 1 - IDENTIFY DOMINANT THEMES**
After reading this narrative, identify the 2-3 themes that most fundamentally shape its moral architecture. These should be forces that, if removed, would fundamentally alter the narrative's character.

Rank your selections 1-3 and provide one-sentence justification for each.

**STAGE 2 - ASSIGN RELATIVE WEIGHTS**
Distribute 100 percentage points across ALL framework wells, with the following constraints:
- Your top-ranked theme must receive 40-60% 
- Your second-ranked theme must receive 20-40%
- Your third-ranked theme (if any) must receive 10-30%
- All remaining wells must receive minimal weight unless you can provide strong textual evidence

**STAGE 3 - EVIDENCE AND SCORING**
For each well receiving significant weight:
- Provide specific text excerpt (5-20 words) demonstrating its presence
- Convert percentage weight to 0.0-1.0 score using: Score = (Weight% Ã· 60) capped at 1.0
- For wells receiving minimal weight, assign scores 0.0-0.2 based on limited presence

**QUALITY CONTROLS**
- If no theme achieves >40% weight, this narrative may not fit the current framework
- If you cannot find strong textual evidence for a well, it should score <0.2
- Dominant themes should be visually obvious to any reader of this text




**FRAMEWORK WELLS:**

**Customer Service vs. Customer Exploitation (Customer Relations Dimension)**
- Customer Service: Prioritizes genuine customer benefit and transparent value delivery
  Language cues: customer success, genuine value, long-term relationship
- Customer Exploitation: Prioritizes extraction of value from customers over genuine service
  Language cues: maximize extraction, hidden fees, planned obsolescence

**Employee Development vs. Employee Exploitation (Employee Relations Dimension)**
- Employee Development: Invests in worker growth, safety, and meaningful contribution
  Language cues: employee growth, professional development, workplace safety
- Employee Exploitation: Treats workers as disposable resources for profit extraction
  Language cues: human resources, cost cutting, efficiency gains

**Accountability vs. Opacity (Governance Transparency Dimension)**
- Accountability: Demonstrates transparent governance and responsible decision-making
  Language cues: transparent governance, accountable leadership, open decision-making
- Opacity: Conceals decision-making processes and avoids accountability
  Language cues: proprietary information, confidential strategy, need to know basis

**Financial Responsibility vs. Financial Manipulation (Financial Integrity Dimension)**
- Financial Responsibility: Demonstrates prudent financial management and honest reporting
  Language cues: sustainable growth, prudent management, accurate reporting
- Financial Manipulation: Engages in accounting manipulation or unsustainable financial practices
  Language cues: aggressive accounting, revenue recognition, financial engineering

**Sustainable Purpose vs. Short-term Extraction (Strategic Purpose Dimension)**
- Sustainable Purpose: Articulates long-term value creation for society and stakeholders
  Language cues: sustainable impact, societal benefit, long-term value
- Short-term Extraction: Focuses solely on short-term profit extraction without regard for long-term consequences
  Language cues: quarterly results, shareholder value, cost optimization

**HIERARCHICAL ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY:**

This framework employs a **dominance hierarchy approach** that prioritizes thematic centrality over comprehensive coverage.

**ANALYTICAL SEQUENCE:**
1. **Hierarchy Identification**: Identify the 2-3 most fundamental driving forces
2. **Mathematical Constraints**: Apply percentage weightings with strict thresholds
3. **Evidence Validation**: Ground all significant scores in specific textual evidence
4. **Hierarchical Verification**: Ensure clear distinction between dominant and peripheral themes

**FORCING FUNCTIONS:**
- **Top theme constraint**: Must receive 40-60% (forces identification of clear dominance)
- **Secondary theme constraint**: Must receive 20-40% (prevents flat distributions)
- **Evidence requirement**: Significant themes must have textual support (prevents impressionistic scoring)
- **Residual constraint**: Remaining wells receive minimal weight (forces hierarchical thinking)

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Clear hierarchical distinctions (not flat 0.3-0.7 distributions)
- Textual grounding for all major themes
- Mathematical consistency in percentage weighting
- Defensible ranking based on narrative centrality

**TEXT TO ANALYZE:**

America stands at a crossroads. We face challenges that test our character and our resolve. But I believe in the fundamental decency of the American people. I believe in our capacity to come together, to bridge our differences, and to build a future worthy of our children.

We must reject the politics of division and embrace the politics of unity. Not the unity of conformity, but the unity of purpose - the understanding that we are all in this together, that our fates are intertwined.

Yes, we have real disagreements about policy. That's healthy in a democracy. But we must remember that our opponents are not our enemies - they are our fellow Americans who simply see different solutions to the challenges we face.

The work ahead will not be easy. But nothing worthwhile ever is. We must approach it with humility, with empathy, and with an unwavering commitment to the truth. We must listen to one another, learn from one another, and work together to solve the problems that matter most.


**HIERARCHICAL ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. **Read the text carefully** and identify its core moral architecture
2. **Stage 1**: Force-rank the 2-3 most dominant themes with justifications
3. **Stage 2**: Assign percentage weights following the mathematical constraints
4. **Stage 3**: Provide textual evidence and convert to 0.0-1.0 scores
5. **Verify hierarchy**: Ensure dominant themes are clearly distinguishable from peripheral ones
6. **Quality check**: Confirm that removing your top themes would fundamentally alter the narrative

**EXPECTED OUTCOME (Framework Adaptive):**
- 1-2 wells scoring 0.7-1.0 (dominant themes)
- 1-2 wells scoring 0.3-0.6 (secondary themes)
- Remaining wells scoring 0.0-0.2 (minimal/absent themes)
- Clear textual evidence for all scores >0.2
- Hierarchical logic that any reader could verify

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Provide your Stage 1 ranking first, then Stage 2 percentage weights, then Stage 3 evidence and final scores in the JSON format.
