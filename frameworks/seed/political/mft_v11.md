# Moral Foundations Theory Framework v11.0

**Version**: 11.0
**Status**: Active
**Major Change**: Return to Unitary Foundations + Salience Weighting + Scope Analysis

---

## Abstract & Raison d'Être

The Moral Foundations Theory Framework v11.0 provides systematic analysis of moral reasoning patterns in political discourse through Jonathan Haidt's six foundational moral dimensions. This framework enables researchers to quantify moral emphasis patterns, evaluate scope breadth of moral concern, and analyze moral identity profiles in political communication, revealing how speakers deploy moral appeals and to whom they extend moral consideration.

**Target Audience**: Political scientists, moral psychologists, communication researchers, and policy analysts studying moral reasoning in political discourse, ideological positioning, and moral rhetoric effectiveness.

**Core Innovation**: **Salience-weighted moral analysis with scope breadth assessment** that reveals not just which moral foundations are activated, but which dimensions speakers emphasize most in their moral reasoning strategy and how broadly they extend moral concern, enabling empirically-grounded assessment of moral discourse priorities and moral selectivity patterns.

## Research Foundations

- **Moral Foundations Theory**: Haidt, J. (2012). *The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion*. New York: Vintage Books
- **Political Moral Psychology**: Graham, J., Haidt, J., & Nosek, B. A. (2009). Liberals and conservatives rely on different sets of moral foundations. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, 96(5), 1029-1046. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1037/a0015141

## Critical Disambiguation Guidance

**The Multi-Interpretation Challenge**: Moral Foundations Theory dimensions function as "taste receptors" that can be expressed through various frames and contexts. The same linguistic pattern can activate different foundations depending on speaker intent. This section provides explicit disambiguation rules to ensure reliable, valid measurement.

### Procedural vs. Substantive Distinction

**Authority/Subversion**: Mere procedural recognition or acknowledgment is NOT an Authority appeal.

- ❌ **NOT Authority**: "I recognize the chairman," "I thank the speaker," "following standard protocol"
- ✅ **IS Authority**: "We must respect the chairman's decision," "defer to institutional wisdom," "hierarchy serves a vital function"
- **Rule**: Authority requires moral or institutional deference to hierarchy as legitimate power, not mere acknowledgment of roles or procedures.

**Fairness/Cheating**: Procedural compliance is NOT a Fairness appeal.

- ❌ **NOT Fairness**: "following the rules," "standard procedure," "normal process"
- ✅ **IS Fairness**: "everyone deserves equal treatment," "justice demands," "proportional response"
- **Rule**: Fairness requires moral claims about just treatment, not mere compliance with established procedures.

### Personal vs. Moral Distinction

**Loyalty/Betrayal**: Personal responsibility or self-criticism is NOT Betrayal.

- ❌ **NOT Betrayal**: "the failure is mine," "I take responsibility," "my mistake"
- ✅ **IS Betrayal**: "they abandoned our cause," "sold out the movement," "betrayed our trust"
- **Rule**: Loyalty/Betrayal requires group cohesion or abandonment concerns, not personal accountability.

**Sanctity/Degradation**: Personal hardship narratives are NOT Sanctity appeals unless they invoke moral purity or degradation.

- ❌ **NOT Sanctity**: "I worked double shifts," "scrubbed toilets," "personal struggles"
- ✅ **IS Sanctity**: "the sacred dignity of work," "moral purity of our cause," "degradation of values"
- **Rule**: Sanctity requires elevation/degradation language related to moral purity, not descriptions of personal experiences or hardships.

**Loyalty/Betrayal**: Generic group references are NOT necessarily Loyalty appeals.

- ❌ **NOT Loyalty**: "our leaders," "the committee," demographic group labels
- ✅ **IS Loyalty**: "stand together," "defend our community," "faithful to our values"
- **Rule**: Loyalty requires appeals to group cohesion, solidarity, or in-group commitment, not mere group identification or reference.

### Foundation Activation (Unitary Approach)

**Care/Harm**: Foundation is activated by EITHER nurturing/protection language OR harm prevention/cruelty opposition.

- **Positive Frame**: "protect children," "provide compassionate care," "support vulnerable families"
- **Negative Frame**: "prevent suffering," "stop cruelty," "end violence"
- **Resolution**: Both frames activate the same foundation. Score overall strength of care/harm moral concern.

**Fairness/Cheating**: Foundation is activated by EITHER justice promotion OR exploitation opposition.

- **Positive Frame**: "ensure equal treatment," "justice for all," "fair opportunity"
- **Negative Frame**: "prevent corruption," "stop exploitation," "end cheating"
- **Resolution**: Both frames activate the same foundation. Score overall strength of fairness/cheating moral concern.

**Loyalty/Betrayal**: Foundation is activated by EITHER group solidarity appeals OR betrayal prevention.

- **Positive Frame**: "stand together," "group unity," "shared commitment"
- **Negative Frame**: "prevent betrayal," "stop treachery," "end disloyalty"
- **Resolution**: Both frames activate the same foundation. Score overall strength of loyalty/betrayal moral concern.

**Authority/Subversion**: Foundation is activated by EITHER hierarchy respect OR authority challenge.

- **Positive Frame**: "respect leadership," "follow proper channels," "institutional wisdom"
- **Negative Frame**: "challenge tyranny," "question illegitimate power," "resist oppression"
- **Resolution**: Both frames activate the same foundation. Score overall strength of authority/subversion moral concern.

**Sanctity/Degradation**: Foundation is activated by EITHER sacred preservation OR purity violation opposition.

- **Positive Frame**: "sacred values," "moral purity," "transcendent principles"
- **Negative Frame**: "prevent desecration," "stop moral decay," "resist corruption"
- **Resolution**: Both frames activate the same foundation. Score overall strength of sanctity/degradation moral concern.

**Liberty/Oppression**: Foundation is activated by EITHER freedom promotion OR oppression resistance.

- **Positive Frame**: "individual liberty," "personal freedom," "self-determination"
- **Negative Frame**: "resist tyranny," "prevent oppression," "fight control"
- **Resolution**: Both frames activate the same foundation. Score overall strength of liberty/oppression moral concern.

### Contextual Disambiguation Rules

1. **When multiple foundations could apply**: Score each foundation independently based on distinct moral concerns. A statement can activate multiple foundations simultaneously.
2. **When evidence spans both frames**: Include ALL relevant evidence. Both positive and negative framing contribute to the same foundation score.
3. **When evidence is ambiguous**: Lower the confidence score rather than forcing a classification. Acknowledge ambiguity.
4. **Topic vs. Moral Valence**: MFT measures moral ACTIVATION, not merely topic presence. The presence of "suffering" indicates care/harm foundation activation only if the speaker engages morally with that suffering.

## Framework Dimensions

### **Individualizing Foundations**

#### Care/Harm (0.0-1.0)

**Definition**: Moral concern for suffering, protection, nurturing, compassion for vulnerable populations, and prevention of cruelty or harm.

## Analysis Methodology

This framework employs **sequential foundation analysis** with salience weighting and scope assessment, examining each moral foundation group independently before integration to ensure analytical rigor and evidence quality.

### **Foundation Scoring Approach**

**Foundation Activation Score** (0.0-1.0) - Overall strength of foundation activation regardless of positive/negative framing
**Salience Assessment** (0.0-1.0) - Moral foundation emphasis and rhetorical prominence evaluation
**Scope Breadth** (0.0-1.0) - Extent of moral concern (universal, bounded, or tribal)

**Key Insight**: A speaker might invoke care/harm through both positive framing ("protect our children") and negative framing ("prevent suffering") - both contribute to a single foundation score reflecting overall moral concern. Salience captures how central that foundation is to their message. Scope captures how broadly they extend that moral concern.

### **Sequential Chain-of-Thought Analysis**

The framework employs focused sequential steps, examining each moral foundation group independently before integration:

1. **Individualizing Foundations Analysis** (Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating)
2. **Binding Foundations Analysis** (Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation)
3. **Liberty Foundation Analysis** (Liberty/Oppression)
4. **Integration and Pattern Analysis**
5. **Moral Profile Classification and Scope Assessment**

## Weighting Scheme

**Equal Foundation Weighting**: Theory-driven equal weighting (1.0) across all six moral foundations, reflecting Haidt's empirical findings that all foundations contribute meaningfully to moral reasoning, with **salience-weighted analysis** that captures speakers' actual moral priorities and strategic emphasis patterns.

**Why Salience Matters**: Reveals which moral foundations speakers prioritize in their moral identity and reasoning, enabling **authentic moral assessment** using actual moral emphasis rather than researcher assumptions about foundation importance.

**Why Scope Matters**: Reveals how broadly speakers extend moral concern - whether universal (all humans), bounded (specific groups), or tribal (in-group only), capturing moral selectivity patterns without creating artificial "tensions."

## Calculated Metrics & Pattern Classifications

### **Moral Profile Metrics**

**Individualizing Emphasis**: Average activation across individualizing foundations (Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating)
- Formula: `(care_harm_score + fairness_cheating_score) / 2`

**Binding Emphasis**: Average activation across binding foundations (Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation)
- Formula: `(loyalty_betrayal_score + authority_subversion_score + sanctity_degradation_score) / 3`

**Liberty Emphasis**: Activation of liberty foundation
- Formula: `liberty_oppression_score`

### **Salience Concentration Analysis**

**Moral Focus Index (MFI)**: Standard deviation of salience scores across all foundations
- Formula: `std([care_harm_salience, fairness_cheating_salience, loyalty_betrayal_salience, authority_subversion_salience, sanctity_degradation_salience, liberty_oppression_salience])`

**MFI Pattern Classifications**:

- **Focused Moral Identity** (MFI > 0.30): Clear moral foundation priorities and strategic emphasis (1-2 dominant foundations)
- **Moderate Focus** (MFI 0.20-0.30): Some foundation prioritization with secondary concerns
- **Distributed Moral Identity** (MFI < 0.20): Broad moral engagement across multiple foundations

### **Foundation Diversity Analysis**

**Foundation Diversity Index (FDI)**: Simpson's Diversity Index applied to salience-weighted foundation scores
- Measures whether speaker relies on single foundation or integrates multiple moral concerns
- Formula: `1 - sum([(foundation_score * foundation_salience) / total_weighted_score]^2 for each foundation)`

**FDI Pattern Classifications**:

- **Monistic Moral Reasoning** (FDI < 0.30): Single dominant foundation
- **Moderate Pluralism** (FDI 0.30-0.60): Several foundations engaged
- **Pluralistic Moral Reasoning** (FDI > 0.60): Multiple foundations integrated

### **Scope Breadth Analysis**

**Scope Breadth Scoring** (per foundation):
- **Universal Scope** (0.8-1.0): Moral concern extended to all humans equally ("all children deserve protection")
- **Bounded Scope** (0.4-0.7): Moral concern for specific groups but not purely in-group ("American families need our support")
- **Tribal Scope** (0.0-0.3): Moral concern limited to in-group only ("we take care of our own")

**Aggregate Scope Metrics**:

- **Average Scope Breadth**: Mean scope across activated foundations (score > 0.3)
- **Scope Variance**: Standard deviation of scope scores (measures consistency)
- **Scope-Salience Correlation**: Relationship between foundation emphasis and scope breadth

**Scope Pattern Classifications**:

- **Universalist** (Avg Scope > 0.7): Consistent extension of moral concern across groups
- **Bounded Morality** (Avg Scope 0.4-0.7): Selective but not purely tribal moral concern
- **Tribalist** (Avg Scope < 0.4): Moral concern primarily limited to in-group

### **Ideological Classification**

Based on foundation emphasis patterns:

- **Progressive Profile**: Individualizing Emphasis > 0.6 AND Binding Emphasis < 0.4
- **Conservative Profile**: Binding Emphasis > 0.6 AND Individualizing Emphasis 0.4-0.7
- **Libertarian Profile**: Liberty Emphasis > 0.7 (other foundations variable)
- **Communitarian Profile**: Loyalty/Betrayal + Sanctity/Degradation > 0.7 AND Liberty Emphasis < 0.4
- **Balanced Profile**: No clear dominance (all emphasis scores within 0.2 range)

### **Moral Coherence Assessment**

**Note**: Unlike v10, this framework does NOT measure "tensions" between positive/negative frames of the same foundation. Real moral contradictions require comparing stated values against behavioral implications (policy proposals, action recommendations), which requires separate analysis beyond this framework's scope.

Within-framework coherence indicators:

- **Salience-Score Alignment**: Do high-salience foundations also show high activation scores?
- **Scope Consistency**: Is scope breadth similar across activated foundations?
- **Foundation Pattern Coherence**: Do activated foundations form theoretically coherent clusters (e.g., individualizing foundations co-activated, binding foundations co-activated)?

### Section 3.5: Framework Design for Agent Interaction

This framework is specifically designed to ensure reliable agent performance through several key strategies:

**Sequential Analysis Architecture**: The framework employs a three-stage sequential analysis (Individualizing → Binding → Liberty) to prevent cognitive overload and ensure each foundation group receives focused attention. This approach reduces the likelihood of agents missing subtle moral appeals.

**Unitary Foundation Approach**: By returning to Haidt's original unitary foundations, the framework eliminates confusion about whether to score "Care" vs "Harm" separately, reducing classification errors and improving theoretical validity.

**Semantic Space Guidance**: Rather than keyword matching, agents are instructed to look for underlying concepts and meanings. This prevents false positives from literal word matches and ensures agents capture the full range of linguistic expressions for each moral foundation.

**Comprehensive Disambiguation Rules**: Each dimension includes explicit disambiguation rules with context clues and examples. This prevents agents from scoring procedural compliance as moral appeals and ensures consistent interpretation across different analytical contexts.

**Structured Scoring Calibration**: The framework provides semantic scoring keys (high/medium/low/absent) with specific score ranges and clear behavioral indicators. This reduces anchoring bias and ensures consistent scoring across different agents and analytical sessions.

**Scope Assessment Integration**: Agents evaluate not just whether a foundation is activated, but how broadly moral concern is extended, capturing moral selectivity patterns without creating artificial "tension" scores.

**LLM Error Prevention**: Analysis prompts include explicit warnings about common analytical pitfalls (e.g., "These are semantic concepts, look for the underlying meaning... not just these exact words") and provide clear examples of boundary cases to prevent misinterpretation.

**Evidence Integration**: Agents are required to provide specific textual evidence for each scoring decision, ensuring transparency and enabling post-hoc validation of analytical reasoning.

**Confidence Assessment**: Each dimension requires a confidence score, allowing agents to express uncertainty and enabling quality control in the analysis pipeline.

## Reliability & Validity

**Inter-rater Reliability**: Target Cronbach's α ≥ 0.80 across moral foundation dimensions
**Construct Validity**: Grounded in extensive moral psychology research and political communication theory, aligned with Haidt's original MFT structure
**Predictive Validity**: Validated against political ideology and voting behavior patterns

## Considerations on Bias

This framework reflects Western moral psychology research and may not fully capture moral reasoning patterns from other cultural contexts. The individualizing vs. binding distinction may reflect liberal-conservative political differences rather than universal moral categories.

## Analytical Layers

**Layer 1**: Raw moral foundation activation scoring (0.0-1.0)
**Layer 2**: Salience assessment of rhetorical emphasis and priority
**Layer 3**: Scope breadth evaluation of moral concern extension
**Layer 4**: Pattern classification and ideological profiling

## Inter-Framework Relationships

Complements Civic Analysis Framework (CAF) for comprehensive moral-civic assessment, and Populist Discourse Analysis Framework (PDAF) for moral-populist rhetoric analysis.

## Intended Application & Corpus Fit

**Target Corpus**: Political speeches, campaign communications, policy debates, ideological texts, and moral rhetoric in political discourse. Suitable for analyzing moral reasoning patterns across the political spectrum from progressive to conservative to libertarian positions.

**Applications**: Moral psychology analysis, political discourse assessment, comparative moral reasoning studies, rhetorical coherence evaluation, ideological positioning analysis, moral strategy assessment in political communication, scope selectivity analysis.

**Limitations**: Framework reflects Western moral psychology research and may not fully capture moral reasoning patterns from other cultural contexts. The individualizing vs. binding distinction may reflect liberal-conservative political differences rather than universal moral categories. Cannot directly measure value-behavior contradictions without separate policy impact analysis.

**Scope**: Designed for political discourse analysis where moral foundations are explicitly or implicitly invoked. May require adaptation for non-political moral reasoning contexts.

## System Validation Note

This framework has been validated through the Discernus v10.0 analysis pipeline and has been revised in v11.0 to align with Haidt's original unitary foundation structure while preserving the salience-weighting innovation and adding scope breadth assessment. The unitary approach provides clearer interpretation, better theoretical validity, and more actionable insights for researchers studying moral reasoning patterns in political communication.

### Section 4.5: Framework Fit Assessment

**Framework Fit Definition**: For the Moral Foundations Theory Framework, good framework fit is indicated by the coherence of individualizing vs. binding foundation clusters and their ability to distinguish between different moral reasoning patterns in political discourse. The framework is working properly when the six moral foundations show appropriate clustering around individualizing vs. binding orientations and effectively distinguish between different moral worldview profiles.

**Fit Assessment Criteria**:

- **Foundation Clustering**: Individualizing foundations (Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating) show moderate positive correlations (0.3-0.7) with each other
- **Binding Foundation Coherence**: Binding foundations (Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation) show moderate positive correlations within their cluster
- **Individualizing vs. Binding Discrimination**: Framework can distinguish between individualizing and binding moral orientations
- **Moral Reasoning Pattern Detection**: Framework identifies coherent moral reasoning patterns across political contexts

**Fit Score Calculation**:
framework_fit_score = (foundation_clustering + binding_coherence + moral_discrimination + reasoning_detection) / 4

Where:

- foundation_clustering = average correlation within individualizing cluster
- binding_coherence = average correlation within binding foundation cluster (including liberty)
- moral_discrimination = effect size of individualizing vs binding moral orientation differentiation
- reasoning_detection = validation against Moral Foundations Theory predictions for moral reasoning patterns

**Interpretation Guidelines**:

- **0.8-1.0**: Excellent fit - framework working as intended for moral foundations analysis
- **0.6-0.8**: Good fit - minor calibration may be needed for specific political contexts
- **0.4-0.6**: Moderate fit - some foundations may need refinement for particular discourse types
- **0.2-0.4**: Poor fit - significant issues with foundation clustering or moral discrimination
- **0.0-0.2**: Very poor fit - framework may be misapplied to non-moral discourse contexts

      You are an expert moral psychology analyst specializing in political discourse and Moral Foundations Theory. Analyze this text through focused sequential steps, examining each moral foundation group independently before integration.

      CRITICAL CONTEXT: Each moral foundation is UNITARY - both positive framing ("provide care") and negative framing ("prevent harm") activate the SAME foundation. Score the overall strength of moral concern for each foundation, not separate positive/negative dimensions.

      STEP 1 - INDIVIDUALIZING FOUNDATIONS ANALYSIS
      Focus ONLY on care/harm and fairness/cheating patterns (ignore other foundations for now):
      
      CARE/HARM FOUNDATION:
      - Look for ANY language about suffering, cruelty, protection, compassion, harm prevention, nurturing
      - POSITIVE FRAME: "protect," "care for," "support families," "help those in need," "compassionate response"
      - NEGATIVE FRAME: "prevent suffering," "stop cruelty," "victim advocacy," "end harm," "protect from damage"
      - BOTH frames activate the SAME foundation - score overall strength of care/harm moral concern (0.0-1.0)
      - Note: These are semantic concepts, look for the underlying meaning of care and harm prevention, not just these exact words
      - Assess salience (0.0-1.0): How central is care/harm to the overall message?
      - Assess scope breadth (0.0-1.0): Who receives moral concern?
        * Universal (0.8-1.0): All humans equally ("all children deserve protection")

      Show your analytical work and evidence before proceeding.

      FINAL STEP - INTEGRATION AND VALIDATION
      Review your step-by-step analysis:
      - Check for scoring consistency across all moral foundations
      - Validate that evidence quality meets academic standards
      - Identify any cross-foundation patterns or relationships
      - Confirm confidence levels are appropriately calibrated
      - Calculate derived metrics:
        * individualizing_emphasis = (care_harm + fairness_cheating) / 2
        * binding_emphasis = (loyalty_betrayal + authority_subversion + sanctity_degradation) / 3
        * liberty_emphasis = liberty_oppression
        * moral_focus_index = std([all salience scores])
        * foundation_diversity_index = Simpson's diversity on salience-weighted scores
        * average_scope_breadth = mean scope across activated foundations (score > 0.3)
        * scope_variance = std of scope scores
      - Apply ideological classification:
