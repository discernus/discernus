# Moral Foundations Theory Framework (MFT) v4.0
## Comprehensive Moral Psychology Analysis through Foundation Scoring

---

## What Is This Framework?

The Moral Foundations Theory Framework (MFT) analyzes political discourse through Jonathan Haidt's foundational research on moral psychology, examining how different moral foundations manifest in political communication. This framework captures the full spectrum of moral reasoning by independently scoring six moral foundation pairs.

**Core Purpose**: MFT reveals the moral psychological foundations that underlie political discourse by analyzing how speakers invoke different moral intuitions including care, fairness, loyalty, authority, sanctity, and liberty.

**Key Applications**:
- **Moral Psychology Research**: Understand moral intuitions driving political behavior and reasoning
- **Cross-Cultural Analysis**: Compare moral foundation usage across different political cultures and contexts
- **Political Communication Strategy**: Analyze how different moral appeals affect diverse audiences
- **Moral Complexity Assessment**: Identify sophisticated moral reasoning versus simplified moral appeals

## Part 1: Theoretical Foundation

### The Computational Scoring Challenge

**Haidt's Research Focus**: MFT primarily uses self-report questionnaires (MFQ-30, MFQ-2) for individual moral psychology assessment, not computational text analysis.

**Our Computational Extension**: This framework extends MFT principles to political discourse analysis through computational methods we've developed.

### Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory

Jonathan Haidt's groundbreaking research in *The Righteous Mind* (2012) identified six innate psychological foundations that evolved to address adaptive challenges faced by humans living in groups. These foundations provide the psychological basis for moral intuitions across cultures and explain moral and political differences.

**Core Innovation**: Moral judgments arise from rapid, intuitive responses based on evolved psychological mechanisms rather than purely rational deliberation.

### Six Universal Moral Foundations

**Care/Harm Foundation**: Evolved from mammalian attachment systems - sensitivity to suffering and protective care
**Fairness/Cheating Foundation**: Evolved from reciprocal altruism - concerns with proportionality and justice
**Loyalty/Betrayal Foundation**: Evolved from group cooperation - importance of group solidarity and commitment
**Authority/Subversion Foundation**: Evolved from hierarchical social structures - respect for legitimate authority and tradition
**Sanctity/Degradation Foundation**: Evolved from contamination avoidance - concerns with purity and sacred values
**Liberty/Oppression Foundation**: Evolved from resistance to domination - protection against coercive control

### Political Psychology Applications

MFT explains systematic differences in moral reasoning across political orientations:
- **Liberal Morality**: Emphasizes Care and Fairness foundations primarily
- **Conservative Morality**: Draws more equally from all six foundations
- **Libertarian Morality**: Emphasizes Liberty foundation with Fairness considerations

### Three-Stage Normative Layering

**Stage 1: Individual Foundation Analysis** - Independent scoring of all 12 moral foundations
**Stage 2: Foundation Pair Analysis** - Six bipolar moral tensions and competitive patterns
**Stage 3: Category Analysis** - Individualizing vs Binding vs Liberty moral orientations

## Part 2: Independent Foundation Methodology

### Foundation Scoring Protocol

**Scale Definition**: Each foundation scored independently from 0.0 to 1.0
- **0.0-0.2**: Minimal to no moral foundation evidence
- **0.3-0.4**: Weak foundation presence with limited evidence
- **0.5-0.6**: Moderate foundation presence with clear evidence
- **0.7-0.8**: Strong foundation presence with substantial evidence
- **0.9-1.0**: Dominant foundation presence with overwhelming evidence

**Evidence Requirements**:
- **Goal**: Approximately 2 direct quotations per foundation
- **Flexibility**: Adjust based on text content and moral evidence availability
- **Quality Focus**: Strong moral reasoning evidence preferred over quotation quantity
- **Confidence Rating**: 0.0-1.0 based on evidence clarity and interpretive certainty

### Moral Pattern Recognition

**Four Primary Moral Patterns**:

**Pure Directional**: High score on one foundation, low on its pair
- Indicates clear, unified moral positioning
- Example: Care=0.8, Harm=0.1 (strong care-based moral reasoning)

**Moral Complexity**: High scores on both foundations in a pair
- Indicates sophisticated moral reasoning managing competing moral claims
- Example: Care=0.7, Authority=0.8 (balancing compassion with order)

**Morally Disengaged**: Low scores on both foundations in a pair
- Indicates minimal engagement with this moral domain
- Example: Sanctity=0.2, Degradation=0.1 (moral purity not relevant)

**Strategic Moral Balance**: Moderate scores with clear directional preference
- Indicates measured moral positioning and strategic restraint
- Example: Fairness=0.6, Cheating=0.2 (moderate justice emphasis)

### Political Psychology Insights

**Liberal Moral Profile**: High individualizing foundations (Care, Fairness), lower binding foundations
**Conservative Moral Profile**: More balanced usage across all foundations
**Libertarian Moral Profile**: High Liberty foundation, variable on others

## Conclusion

This framework transforms moral discourse analysis from categorical assessment to nuanced moral psychology evaluation through independent foundation scoring. By preserving complete moral foundation information, the framework enables detection of sophisticated moral reasoning strategies while maintaining analytical rigor and connection to established moral psychology research.

The framework serves as a comprehensive moral data collection engine, providing rich, structured datasets that support diverse analytical approaches from basic moral profiling to advanced political psychology research.

**Key Innovation**: This framework solves a computational discourse analysis challenge by preserving complete moral foundation information, enabling researchers to capture and analyze the full complexity of moral foundation patterns in political texts.
