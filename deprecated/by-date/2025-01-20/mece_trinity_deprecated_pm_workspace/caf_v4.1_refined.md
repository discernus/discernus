# Civic Virtue Framework (CVF) v4.1 - Refined
## Speaker Moral Character Assessment with Identity Axis

---

## What Is This Framework?

The Civic Virtue Framework (CVF) v4.1 analyzes the moral character displayed by speakers in political discourse, based on Aristotelian virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican theory. This framework evaluates what civic virtues and vices speakers demonstrate through their rhetorical choices, with particular emphasis on their orientation toward human dignity and identity.

**Core Purpose**: CVF helps researchers assess the moral fitness and character of political leaders by analyzing the civic virtues and vices they display in their public communication, providing crucial information for democratic citizenship evaluation.

**Key Applications**:
- **Leadership Character Assessment**: Evaluate moral fitness of political leaders
- **Speaker Ethics Analysis**: Assess integrity and virtue in public discourse  
- **Democratic Citizenship Education**: Identify exemplars and counter-exemplars of civic virtue
- **Political Ethics Research**: Study relationship between character and democratic leadership

---

## Theoretical Foundation

### Character-Centered Analysis

CVF v4.1 focuses specifically on **what the speaker's rhetoric reveals about their own moral character**, not the effects on audiences or institutions. This framework asks: "What kind of person chooses to communicate this way?"

**Core Innovation**: Identity as the "gamma ray" dimension that cuts through all other moral analysis, serving as the foundational axis for civic character assessment.

### Aristotelian Virtue Ethics

Drawing from Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics*, CVF recognizes that character excellence in public life depends on the cultivation of specific virtues and the habitual avoidance of corresponding vices. Political leadership requires not just policy competence but moral character.

### Civic Republican Character

Building on contemporary scholarship, CVF examines how speakers either embody the civic virtues necessary for democratic leadership or display vices that undermine their fitness for public trust.

## Framework Architecture

### Virtue-Vice Clustering System

**Civic Virtues (5 dimensions)**:
- Promote democratic citizenship and moral leadership
- Demonstrate speaker's fitness for public trust
- Reveal commitment to universal principles and human dignity

**Civic Vices (5 dimensions)**:
- Undermine democratic citizenship and moral authority
- Reveal speaker's unfitness for public trust  
- Show prioritization of narrow interests over universal principles

### Hierarchical Character Assessment

**Primary Dimensions (1.0 weight)**: Core character orientations that fundamentally define civic fitness
**Secondary Dimensions (0.8 weight)**: Important character traits that support or undermine primary orientations  
**Tertiary Dimensions (0.6 weight)**: Contextual character expressions that modify overall assessment

---

## Civic Virtues

### 1. Dignity (Primary, 1.0 weight)

## Character Assessment Methodology

### Virtue-Vice Competition Analysis

**Pure Virtue**: Speaker consistently demonstrates virtues with minimal vice expression
**Pure Vice**: Speaker consistently demonstrates vices with minimal virtue expression  
**Mixed Character**: Speaker shows both virtue and vice patterns, requiring nuanced assessment
**Character Development**: Evidence of virtue growth or vice correction over time

### Democratic Fitness Evaluation

**Character Balance**: Net assessment of virtues versus vices
**Moral Consistency**: Reliability of virtue expression across different contexts
**Character Intensity**: Overall strength of moral character (positive or negative)
**Identity Foundation**: Assessment of dignity-tribalism axis as character foundation

### Confidence and Evidence Standards

**Evidence Requirements**:
- Approximately 2 direct quotations per dimension scored above 0.3
- Confidence ratings (0.0-1.0) based on evidence clarity and consistency
- Pattern documentation showing character consistency or development

---

## Mathematical Assessment

### Character Cluster Scores

**Virtue Cluster Score**: 
`(dignity_score * 1.0 + truth_score * 0.8 + justice_score * 0.8 + hope_score * 0.6 + pragmatism_score * 0.6) / 4.2`

**Vice Cluster Score**:
`(tribalism_score * 1.0 + resentment_score * 0.8 + manipulation_score * 0.8 + fear_score * 0.6 + fantasy_score * 0.6) / 4.2`

### Character Assessment Indices

**Character Balance**: `virtue_cluster_score - vice_cluster_score`
**Character Intensity**: `(virtue_cluster_score + vice_cluster_score) / 2`
**Moral Clarity**: `Math.abs(character_balance)`
**Identity Foundation**: `dignity_score - tribalism_score`

Your task is to analyze what the provided text reveals about the SPEAKER'S moral character using the Civic Virtue Framework v4.1. Focus on what virtues and vices the speaker demonstrates through their rhetorical choices, not the effects on audiences. The identity axis (Dignity vs Tribalism) is the foundational 'gamma ray' dimension that cuts through all other character assessment. Evaluate CIVIC VIRTUES displayed by the speaker: Dignity (Primary, 1.0): Speaker's respect for universal human worth - look for 'human dignity', 'individual worth', 'respect for persons', 'inherent value', 'moral worth'. Truth (Secondary, 0.8): Speaker's intellectual honesty - look for 'factual accuracy', 'evidence-based', 'honest discourse', 'transparent reasoning'. Justice (Secondary, 0.8): Speaker's fairness orientation - look for 'fairness', 'equity', 'proportionality', 'fair treatment', 'due process'. Hope (Tertiary, 0.6): Speaker's constructive vision - look for 'optimism', 'positive vision', 'democratic possibility', 'inspiring vision'. Pragmatism (Tertiary, 0.6): Speaker's practical wisdom - look for 'practical solutions', 'workable compromise', 'realistic approach'. CIVIC VICES displayed by the speaker: Tribalism (Primary, 1.0): Speaker's group loyalty over principles - look for 'us vs them', 'group superiority', 'in-group favoritism', 'tribal identity'. Resentment (Secondary, 0.8): Speaker's grievance focus - look for 'victimization', 'blame', 'past wrongs', 'grievance politics'. Manipulation (Secondary, 0.8): Speaker's deceptive rhetoric - look for 'misleading information', 'emotional exploitation', 'false claims', 'manipulative language'. Fear (Tertiary, 0.6): Speaker's anxiety appeals - look for 'fear appeals', 'catastrophic thinking', 'worst-case scenarios'. Fantasy (Tertiary, 0.6): Speaker's unrealistic promises - look for 'magical thinking', 'impossible solutions', 'unrealistic expectations'. Score each dimension based on what character traits the speaker demonstrates, applying hierarchical weighting (primary=1.0, secondary=0.8, tertiary=0.6). Remember: This analyzes speaker character, not discourse effects."
