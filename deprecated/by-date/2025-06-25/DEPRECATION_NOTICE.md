# Deprecation Notice - 2025-06-25

## execute_experiment_definition.py

**Status:** DEPRECATED  
**Date:** 2025-06-25  
**Reason:** Obsolete - Superseded by comprehensive_experiment_orchestrator.py

### Why Deprecated

The `execute_experiment_definition.py` script (642 lines) has been superseded by the more comprehensive and sophisticated `comprehensive_experiment_orchestrator.py` (4759 lines). Key reasons:

1. **Limited Functionality**: Only supports JSON, lacks YAML support
2. **Simpler Architecture**: No checkpoint/resume capability
3. **Basic Validation**: Lacks the 9-dimensional validation framework
4. **Limited Academic Integration**: No advanced statistical analysis pipeline
5. **No Research Workspace Integration**: Cannot handle complex research workflows

### Migration Path

**Replace this:**
```bash
python3 scripts/applications/execute_experiment_definition.py experiment.json
```

**With this:**
```bash
python3 scripts/applications/comprehensive_experiment_orchestrator.py experiment.yaml
```

### Feature Comparison

| Feature | execute_experiment_definition.py | comprehensive_experiment_orchestrator.py |
|---------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| File Format | JSON only | YAML + JSON |
| Validation | Basic | 9-dimensional framework |
| Checkpoints | None | Full checkpoint/resume |
| Academic Output | Basic exports | Complete academic pipeline |
| Research Integration | None | Full workspace integration |
| Statistical Analysis | Basic | Advanced hypothesis testing |
| Transaction Safety | None | Full transaction integrity |

### Benefits of Migration

- **Enhanced Academic Pipeline**: Automatic statistical analysis, R script generation, academic exports
- **Better Validation**: 9-dimensional validation ensures experiment quality
- **Research Workflow Integration**: Works with research workspaces
- **YAML Support**: More flexible experiment definition format
- **Transaction Safety**: Checkpoint/resume capability for long experiments
- **Production Quality**: Comprehensive QA and architectural compliance

### If You Need Simple Execution

For simple, lightweight experiment execution, consider using the comprehensive orchestrator with simplified experiment definitions rather than maintaining this deprecated script.
