# Archived Documentation - January 17, 2025

## What Was Archived

**Directory**: `pm/soar/` (moved to `deprecated/by-date/2025-01-17/soar/`)

**Contents**:
- `soar_v1/` - Original SOAR v1.0 specifications and documentation
- `soar_v2/` - SOAR v2.0 specifications and methodology
- `frameworks/` - SOAR-specific framework implementations

## Why Archived

As part of the **Documentation Refactoring Plan Phase 6**, SOAR-specific documentation was archived because:

1. **Terminology Absorbed**: SOAR concepts have been absorbed into the main Discernus platform documentation
2. **Domain-Neutral Focus**: Platform documentation now uses domain-neutral language rather than SOAR-specific terminology  
3. **Strategic Coherence**: Eliminates scattered PM documents that created conflicting visions
4. **THIN Compliance**: Consolidates documentation to prevent agent drift toward THICK patterns

## Migration Path

**SOAR concepts integrated into**:
- `docs/PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` - Multi-agent orchestration principles
- `docs/DISCERNUS_STRATEGIC_VISION.md` - Adversarial review and transparency principles
- `docs/CORE_INFRASTRUCTURE_GUIDE.md` - Agent registry and coordination patterns

## Access

This archived documentation remains available for historical reference but is no longer actively maintained. All active development should reference the current documentation in the `docs/` directory.
