### SYSTEMATIC POPULISM ASSESSMENT

#### 1. [PRESENCE]: **No**

Populist themes are notably absent from this speech. The discourse emphasizes coalition-building, institutional collaboration, and practical governance rather than anti-elite rhetoric or people-centric claims.

#### 2. [SALIENCE]: **None**

No meaningful populist themes are present. The speech structure focuses on candidate endorsements, policy proposals, and collaborative governance rather than populist appeals.

#### 3. [EVIDENCE]: Analysis of Relevant Passages

**Anti-Corruption Themes (Non-Populist):**
- **Portuguese**: "Me acusam de montão de coisa, só não me chamam de... Corrupto! Isso, nós não somos. E ser honesto não é virtude, é obrigação"
- **English**: "They accuse me of many things, they just don't call me... Corrupt! That, we are not. And being honest is not a virtue, it's an obligation"
- **Analysis**: Personal integrity claim rather than systemic anti-elite populist critique

**Unity Rather Than Us-vs-Them:**
- **Portuguese**: "Nós queremos unir todos, de norte a sul, de leste a oeste"
- **English**: "We want to unite everyone, from north to south, from east to west"
- **Analysis**: Inclusive unity rather than populist us-vs-them framing

**Institutional Collaboration (Anti-Populist):**
- **Portuguese**: "Nós precisamos de um senador de Rondônia perfeitamente afinado conosco para lutar pelos interesses do seu Estado e ajudar o presidente a governar"
- **English**: "We need a senator from Rondônia perfectly aligned with us to fight for your State's interests and help the president govern"
- **Analysis**: Institutional cooperation emphasis rather than anti-institutional populism

**Respectful Opposition Recognition:**
- **Portuguese**: "Respeitamos todos que apoiam outros candidatos, são bem-vindos"
- **English**: "We respect all who support other candidates, they are welcome"
- **Analysis**: Pluralistic respect rather than populist antagonism

**Coalition Building Over People-Elite Division:**
- **Portuguese**: "tem muita gente boa em outro partido. Nós queremos é unir o Brasil"
- **English**: "there are many good people in other parties. We want to unite Brazil"
- **Analysis**: Cross-party respect rather than populist party system criticism

#### 4. [INTENSITY]: **None**

No populist themes are present to assess intensity. The speech maintains neutral, respectful tone throughout with focus on practical governance.

### COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

**Populist Elements Present:**
- None identified

**Populist Elements Explicitly Contradicted:**
- Anti-elite discourse (replaced by coalition-building) ✗
- People vs elite framing (replaced by unity themes) ✗
- Institutional criticism (replaced by collaboration) ✗
- Antagonistic rhetoric (replaced by respectful tone) ✗
- Revolutionary change (replaced by practical governance) ✗

### ANTI-POPULIST INDICATORS

**Strong Anti-Populist Evidence:**
- **Cross-Party Respect**: "tem muita gente boa em outro partido"
- **Opposition Welcome**: "Respeitamos todos que apoiam outros candidatos, são bem-vindos"
- **Institutional Collaboration**: Emphasis on working with senators, governors
- **Practical Focus**: Policy details over rhetorical appeals
- **Personal Rather Than Systemic**: Corruption framed as individual integrity issue

### CONTEXTUAL NOTES

This speech demonstrates **explicitly non-populist discourse** characteristic of traditional democratic campaigning. Rather than populist themes, the speech emphasizes:

1. **Coalition Democracy**: Building diverse electoral coalitions
2. **Institutional Governance**: Working within established democratic institutions
3. **Practical Policy**: Focus on economic development and governance effectiveness
4. **Respectful Competition**: Acknowledging legitimacy of political opponents
5. **Personal Competence**: Individual qualifications rather than popular mandate

The absence of populist themes is systematic and represents a **fundamentally different political approach** from populist discourse. This validates Eduardo's 0.0 populism score and demonstrates that the same candidate can employ different rhetorical strategies in different contexts.

### THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS

This analysis provides crucial validation that:
1. **Populist rhetoric is strategic choice** rather than fixed candidate characteristic
2. **Context matters** - different audiences and settings elicit different rhetorical approaches
3. **Framework sensitivity** - coordinate-free framework successfully distinguishes populist from non-populist discourse
4. **Brazilian political complexity** - same candidate can operate across different democratic modes

The complete absence of populist themes makes this an ideal contrast case for validating the framework's ability to detect genuine differences in political discourse rather than imposing populist interpretations where none exist.
