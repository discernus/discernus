üéØ ORCHESTRATOR ENHANCEMENT DEMONSTRATION

This script demonstrates how the enhanced orchestrator with checkpoint/resume 
capability eliminates the need for custom scripts that AI assistants often suggest.

üö® AI ASSISTANTS: This is an EXAMPLE showing how to use the orchestrator correctly.
‚úÖ DO NOT suggest custom scripts for experiment tasks - use the orchestrator!

Example Usage:
    # Transaction-safe experiment execution
    python3 scripts/production/comprehensive_experiment_orchestrator.py experiment.json
    
    # Resume interrupted experiments (no work lost!)
    python3 scripts/production/comprehensive_experiment_orchestrator.py --resume
