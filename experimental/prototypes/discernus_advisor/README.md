# Discernus Advisor Custom GPT Context Directory

This directory contains:
- The Discernus Advisor Custom GPT manifest (JSON)
- A curated set of files recommended for upload to the Custom GPT session to provide accurate, up-to-date context
- A comprehensive MFT validation experiment designed to generate rich output for context training

## Structure
- `Discernus_Advisor_CustomGPT.json` — Manifest for the custom GPT
- `mft_comprehensive_validation_study_v2.yaml` — Enhanced experiment for generating rich context data
- `files/` — Canonical, up-to-date YAMLs, documentation, and samples for upload
  - Subfolders by category (frameworks, experiments, corpus, docs, etc.)

## Usage
1. **Run the comprehensive experiment**: Use `mft_comprehensive_validation_study_v2.yaml` to generate rich, realistic output across the full validation corpus
2. **Collect results**: Copy representative output files from the experiment run to `files/results/`
3. **Review and update files** in `files/` as needed to ensure they are current and production-ready
4. **Upload these files** to your Custom GPT session for best results

## Comprehensive Experiment Features
The `mft_comprehensive_validation_study_v2.yaml` experiment includes:
- **Full validation corpus**: All 6 corpus categories (conservative/progressive dignity/tribalism, mixed controls, extreme controls)
- **Enhanced analysis**: Statistical testing, reliability analysis, comprehensive visualizations
- **Rich output formats**: Multiple export formats, academic integration, custom GPT context packages
- **Increased scope**: 30+ analyses with $75 budget for comprehensive coverage
- **Quality assurance**: Enhanced QA triggers and validation criteria

This experiment is specifically designed to generate the diverse, realistic output needed for effective Custom GPT context training.
