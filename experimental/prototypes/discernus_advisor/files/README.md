# Discernus Advisor Context Files

This directory contains curated, up-to-date files to upload to the Discernus Advisor Custom GPT for optimal context and accuracy.

## Subfolders
- `frameworks/` — Canonical Discernus framework YAMLs
- `experiments/` — Representative, current experiment YAMLs
- `corpus/` — Small, schema-compliant corpus samples
- `docs/` — Key documentation (e.g., unified experiment spec)

## Curation Policy
- Only include the latest, production-ready files
- No deprecated, legacy, or experimental drafts
- Corpus samples should be small and representative
- Documentation should be the canonical, unified version

Review and update these files regularly to ensure the best results from the advisor.
