# Project Milestones - Narrative Gravity Model

#personal/writing/narrativegravity

## ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT STATUS (January 2025): Validation-First Development

**Milestone 1 Infrastructure**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**NEW PRIORITY**: Academic validation studies to establish credibility before publication.

**See**: `VALIDATION_FIRST_DEVELOPMENT_STRATEGY.md` for detailed 3-phase validation plan.

---

Below are the three high-level milestones for Milestone 1 (validation research infrastructure), Milestone 2 (publication-ready package), and Milestone 3 (public platform deployment). Each milestone builds on the previous, ensuring a solid foundation for academic credibility and later broader adoption.

## Milestone 1: Validation Research Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETED

**Goal:**  
Build and deliver the core API-driven tooling and admin UI that allow the Project Founder to ingest a growing "consequential narratives" corpus, invoke multiple LLMs via Hugging Face, and generate fully instrumented, multi-run analysis results.

**STATUS**: âœ… All infrastructure complete. Moving to validation studies phase.

**Key Deliverables:**  
- Backend services for JSONL corpus ingestion, schema validation, chunking, and job orchestration  
- Hugging Face Inference API integration supporting multiple models and automatic retries  
- Results-analysis engine computing variance, confidence intervals, and inter-model agreement  
- Web-based admin dashboard for corpus management, job launch, real-time monitoring, cost tracking, and data export  
- CLI utility for generating JSONL corpus files from raw source texts, with chunking and metadata computation  
- Schema-migration tooling and versioned JSON Schema repository  

**Success Criteria:**  
- Ability to batch-process 100â€“200 texts Ã— 3 frameworks Ã— 2â€“4 models Ã— 5 runs in under 4 hours  
- Real-time visibility into job progress, per-task status, and spending against the $2 500 budget  
- Exportable CSV/JSON datasets containing all raw and aggregated metrics, ready for analysis

## Milestone 2: Publication-Ready Academic Package

**Goal:**  
Leverage the infrastructure from Milestone 1 to produce the "receipts"â€”robust validation studies, expert reliability data, and reproducible replication materialsâ€”culminating in a complete draft paper and replication package for friendly peer review.

**Key Deliverables:**  
- Curated validation corpus of "consequential narratives" with documented metadata and chunking  
- Multi-LLM reliability study (intra- and inter-model variance) across selected texts  
- Expert-panel calibration study design and results, plus crowdsourced spot-checks  
- Replication package: raw inputs, chunking metadata, API parameters, run-level outputs, analysis scripts, and instructions  
- Draft academic paper (methods, results, discussion) formatted for target journal submission  
- Tutorial documentation and example notebooks for collaborators to reproduce all analyses  

**Success Criteria:**  
- Completion of expert and crowdsourced validation studies demonstrating statistical reliability  
- Fully documented, versioned replication package that passes tests on the "golden set" corpus  
- A polished manuscript ready to share with academic collaborators and conference reviewers

## Milestone 3: Public Platform Deployment

**Goal:**  
Parallel to journal submission, launch a minimal public-facing interface (or beta API) that exposes the core Civic Virtue framework (and optionally others) to journalists, researchers, and engaged citizensâ€”positioning the project for broader adoption and impact.

**Key Deliverables:**  
- Lightweight public web app or hosted API demonstrating single-text analysis with excerpted evidence  
- Embedded visualizations and plain-English summaries tailored for non-technical users  
- Usage monitoring and basic user management (API keys, rate limits)  
- Branding, landing pages, and lightweight PR plan targeting media analysts and early adopters  
- Licensing and attribution notices built into the UI, reflecting the core copyleft + extension-permissive model  

**Success Criteria:**  
- First 100 registered users (journalists, researchers, engaged citizens) completing analyses  
- Media mentions or pilot integrations with at least one newsroom or academic lab  
- Positive feedback on usability and interpretability, driving roadmap for next iteration
