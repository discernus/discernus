# Discernus Product Strategy: A Posit Analogue for Academic Research

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Strategic Framework

## 1. Executive Summary

To achieve widespread academic adoption while building a sustainable business, Discernus will adopt a three-pillar product strategy analogous to the highly successful model pioneered by RStudio (now Posit). This strategy is designed to build deep trust within the academic community through genuine open-source contributions while solving high-value institutional problems with a proprietary, commercial platform.

Our strategy separates the **academic public good** (the open standards and free individual tools) from the **commercial infrastructure** (the managed platform for scaled research). This allows us to empower individual researchers without restriction, creating a massive user base that naturally discovers the need for our paid institutional solutions as their work scales in complexity and collaborative scope.

## 2. The Three-Pillar Strategy

Our model is built on a foundation of trust, generosity, and solving problems that emerge naturally with scale. It is explicitly designed to avoid artificial limitations that create friction with academic culture.

| Posit Component | Discernus Analogue | What It Is (The Tangible Asset) | Strategic Purpose & Business Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pillar 1: The Open Standard** | | | |
| **GNU R Language** | **DCS Mathematical Foundations & Framework Specifications** | A set of peer-reviewed, citable **documents** and **data standards**. | **Builds Trust & Creates a Moat.** This is the non-commercial, academic "public good." We are its primary stewards, not its owners. Its widespread adoption makes our commercial tools more valuable. This is a **cost center** that generates **academic credibility**. |
| **Pillar 2: The Free Individual Tool** | | | |
| **RStudio Desktop IDE** | **`discernus-community` Python Package & Extensions** | A `pip install`-able Python library with core functions and a **local runtime**. Includes Jupyter/VSCode extensions. | **Drives Adoption & Creates Muscle Memory.** This is a powerful, feature-complete tool for individual researchers, free and open-source (GPL). Its limitations are natural consequences of local computing (scale, collaboration). This is our primary **marketing and educational tool**. |
| **Pillar 3: The Commercial Institutional Infrastructure** | | | |
| **Posit Workbench, Connect, Package Manager** | **`Discernus Cloud` & `Discernus Enterprise Server`** | A managed, server-side application: our **orchestrator, API, and database backend**. This is the **managed, server-side runtime.** | **Generates Revenue by Solving Institutional Problems.** This is our **proprietary, paid product.** It solves problems of scale, collaboration, compliance (IRB), security, and high-performance computation that are impossible to manage in a local notebook. |

## 3. Detailed Bill of Materials (BOM)

This BOM provides a concrete breakdown of the software and documentation assets required to execute our three-pillar strategy.

### Pillar 1: The Open Standard (Academic Public Good)

**Strategic Goal:** Establish the intellectual foundation of the ecosystem. Build trust and academic credibility. This pillar is comprised entirely of **documentation and data standards.**

| Asset Name | Type | Description | File Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DCS Mathematical Foundations** | Document (Markdown) | The complete, citable mathematical specification for the Discernus Coordinate System. This is our "academic whitepaper" and the root of our methodological authority. | `Discernus_Coordinate_System_Mathematical_Foundations_1_0.md` |
| **Framework Specifications** | Document (Markdown) | Human-readable documents that outline the purpose, philosophy, capabilities, and schema for a given version of the framework architecture (e.g., v3.2) and experiment architecture. | `Discernus_Coordinate_System_Framework_Specification_3_2.md`, `Discernus_Experiment_System_Specification_v3.2.0.md` |
| **Framework & Experiment Schemas** | Data Standard (YAML/JSON Schema) | Machine-readable definitions of the structure, fields, and constraints that valid `Framework` and `Experiment` files must adhere to. Used for programmatic validation. | `schemas/framework_schema_v3.2.json`, `schemas/experiment_schema_v3.2.json` |
| **Reference Framework Definitions** | Data (YAML) | Illustrative, version-controlled YAML files for specific frameworks (e.g., MFT) that serve as best-practice examples and starting points for researchers. | `reference_frameworks/mft_v3.2.yaml`, `reference_frameworks/populism_v3.2.yaml` |
