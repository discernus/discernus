# Dual-Use Threat Model: The "Dark Arts"

**Status:** Internal Assessment  
**Purpose:** To go in "eyes open" about the potential for misuse of the Discernus platform, so we can build a resilient ethical and strategic response.

## 1. The "Dark Wizards": A Threat Actor Model

The actors we are concerned with are not researchers seeking truth, but **operators seeking influence.** Their goal is to persuade, polarize, pacify, or confuse a target population by manipulating the information ecosystem.

**Potential Actors:**
-   **State-level intelligence agencies** running disinformation or foreign influence campaigns.
-   **Unscrupulous political campaign strategists** focused on opposition destruction over persuasion.
-   **Black-hat marketing firms** creating astroturfed "grassroots" movements or engaging in corporate sabotage.
-   **Extremist groups** aiming to radicalize and recruit vulnerable individuals by optimizing propaganda.
-   **Financial market manipulators** spreading rumors to affect stock prices.

## 2. The "Dark Arts" Playbook: How They Would Weaponize Discernus

A tool designed for mapping can be repurposed for targeting.

### Playbook A: Offensive Narrative Engineering
This is micro-targeting on steroids, moving from demographic targeting to psychographic and narrative targeting.

*   **Step 1: Profile the Target's Vulnerabilities.** An operator would create a custom Discernus Framework not based on established academic theory, but on psychological vulnerabilities. The anchors would not be "Liberty" and "Fairness," but rather **"Fear_of_Outsiders," "Economic_Anxiety," "Sense_of_Victimhood,"** and **"Resentment_of_Elites."**
*   **Step 2: Map the Population.** The operator would ingest massive amounts of public text from a target group (e.g., from specific subreddits, Facebook groups, or Telegram channels) and use Discernus to calculate the population's aggregate "centroid" on this vulnerability map.
*   **Step 3: Craft and Optimize the Message.** They would then generate dozens or hundreds of message variants (text, images, memes) and use Discernus to rapidly score them. The goal is to find the message that is mathematically calculated to pull the population's centroid in a desired direction (e.g., further towards "Fear_of_Outsiders" or away from "Trust_in_Institutions").
*   **Step 4: Deploy and Measure.** The operator would deploy this optimized message through botnets, targeted ads, or organic-seeming posts. They would then use Discernus to measure the real-time effect on the target population's discourse, refining the message in a continuous, AI-driven feedback loop.

### Playbook B: Defensive Counter-Messaging & Computational Propaganda
This moves beyond simple "rapid response" to automated narrative disruption.

*   **Step 1: Map the Opponent.** An operative would use Discernus to map an opponent's (e.g., a rival campaign, a corporate competitor) narrative in real-time, using a framework designed to find rhetorical weak points like **"Inconsistent_Statements," "Hypocritical_Positions,"** or **"Unpopular_Associations."**
*   **Step 2: Identify Attack Vectors.** The system would automatically flag which of the opponent's statements are furthest from the desired public opinion centroid, identifying the most effective lines of attack.
*   **Step 3: Automate Counter-Messaging.** The operator could automate the generation of counter-messaging (e.g., social media posts, press release snippets) specifically designed to disrupt or neutralize the opponent's narrative by targeting these data-proven weaknesses.

## 3. The Core Ethical Tension

The very features that make Discernus powerful for legitimate research are what make it dangerous in the wrong hands:
-   **Adaptability:** The ability to plug in any framework means it can be used with a "Vulnerability Framework" just as easily as with Moral Foundations Theory.
-   **Scalability:** The ability to analyze thousands of documents quickly is what makes population-level mapping feasible.
-   **Clarity:** The intuitive visual outputs that help a researcher see patterns can also help an operator see targets.

Pretending this dual-use potential does not exist is not a viable strategy. We must acknowledge it and build our corporate and community strategy around mitigating it.
