## The Pledge

By affirming my/our commitment to the ethical use of the Discernus platform and toolkit, I/we publicly pledge to uphold the following principles in all work that utilizes this technology:

**1. A Commitment to Advancing Understanding.**
*   I/We will use these tools to map, explore, and understand complex discourse. The primary goal of my/our work will be to generate insight, test theories, and contribute to a more nuanced public understanding, not to intentionally confuse, mislead, or polarize.

**2. A Commitment to Methodological Transparency.**
*   I/We will be transparent about the frameworks and methods used in my/our analysis. When publishing or sharing results, I/we will make the definitions of our anchors and axes available for scrutiny, allowing our peers to understand and critique the theoretical basis of our work.

**3. A Commitment to Rejecting Disinformation and Hate.**
*   I/We will not use these tools to knowingly create, optimize, or disseminate content that qualifies as hate speech, incites violence, or constitutes a campaign of targeted disinformation designed to harm individuals, communities, or democratic processes.

**4. A Commitment to Protecting the Vulnerable.**
*   I/We will consider the potential impact of my/our research and analysis on vulnerable populations. I/we will not use these tools to design or target messaging that exploits known psychological vulnerabilities for malicious or predatory purposes.

**5. A Commitment to Accountability.**
*   I/We make this affirmation publicly and voluntarily. I/We understand that by displaying the "Discernus - Ethically Affirmed" badge, I/we are inviting our peers, our communities, and the public to hold us accountable to these principles.
