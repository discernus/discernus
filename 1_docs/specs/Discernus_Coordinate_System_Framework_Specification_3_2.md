## üìã **ADVANCED FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE**

### **Core Philosophy: Multi-Dimensional Semantic Mapping**

v3.2 frameworks are **sophisticated analytical instruments** capable of capturing complex theoretical relationships, competitive dynamics, and temporal evolution patterns. Framework capabilities are determined by component presence and configuration sophistication:

### **Hybrid Axes-Anchors Architecture (v3.2 Recommended)**

**Framework Architecture Overview:**
- **Components**: All anchors must be registered as independent components with unique `component_id` values
- **Axes**: Reference anchors by their `anchor_ids` and include optional `anchor_summary` for rapid comprehension
- **Hybrid Clarity**: Combines structural rigor with human-readable summaries for optimal LLM and human consumption

**Axes-Anchors Relationship:**
- **Anchors** are independent semantic components, each with unique identifiers and comprehensive definitions
- **Axes** are bipolar relationships between exactly two anchor components, creating true oppositional dimensions
- **Polar Constraint** ensures mathematical rigor: each axis represents a single dimension with two endpoints
- **Anchor Summary** provides brief descriptions within axes for rapid understanding without dereferencing
- **Multi-Point Guidance** directs users to anchor-set frameworks when 3+ reference points are needed

## üìñ **FRAMEWORK CONSUMPTION GUIDE**

### **How to Process Hybrid Architecture Frameworks**

**For LLM and API Consumers:**

**1. Processing Order (Critical)**
```
Step 1: Parse component registry for anchor definitions
Step 2: Parse axes for anchor_ids and relationships  
Step 3: Use anchor_summary for rapid context (optional)
Step 4: Resolve anchor_ids to full component definitions for computation
```

**2. Data Authority Hierarchy**
- **Primary Source**: Component registry anchor definitions (complete data)
- **Reference Mechanism**: Axis anchor_ids (structural relationships)  
- **Convenience Layer**: anchor_summary (human-readable context only)
- **Rule**: If discrepancy exists, trust component registry over anchor_summary

**3. Validation Priorities**
```
‚úÖ Required: Verify all anchor_ids in axes exist in component registry
‚úÖ Required: Confirm each axis contains exactly 2 anchor_ids (polar constraint)
‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended: Validate anchor_summary matches component registry when present
‚ùå Never: Use anchor_summary for mathematical calculations
```

**For Framework Developers:**

**1. Design Decision Tree**
- **2 Reference Points** ‚Üí Use axis-set framework (bipolar relationships)
- **3+ Reference Points** ‚Üí Use anchor-set framework (independent positioning)
- **Non-oppositional concepts** ‚Üí Use anchor-set framework

**2. Implementation Checklist**
- [ ] Register all anchors in component registry with unique IDs
- [ ] Reference exactly 2 anchors per axis using anchor_ids
- [ ] Include anchor_summary for clarity (recommended)
- [ ] Validate true oppositional relationship between axis poles
- [ ] Test framework with validator before deployment

**For System Implementers:**

**1. Parsing Requirements**
```python
# Required validation during framework loading:
assert len(axis.anchor_ids) == 2, "Polar constraint violation"
assert all(id in components for id in axis.anchor_ids), "Missing component"
assert axis.pole_a != axis.pole_b, "Identical poles invalid"
```

## üì¶ **FRAMEWORK EMBEDDING BEST PRACTICES**

### **Experiment System Integration Considerations**

When frameworks are embedded in experiment definitions (see **[Experiment System Specification v3.2](Discernus_Experiment_System_Specification_v3.2.0.md)**), proper prompt element placement becomes critical for optimal LLM processing and cognitive context establishment.

### **Core Principle: Sequential LLM Processing Optimization**

**LLM Processing Challenge**: When frameworks are embedded in experiments, LLMs process content sequentially, requiring strategic placement of prompt elements to establish proper cognitive context before framework interpretation.

**Solution: Early Context Setting + Late Detailed References**

### **Recommended Prompt Placement Architecture**

```yaml
# OPTIMAL: Early Context Setting (immediately after framework metadata)
name: framework_name
version: v3.2
display_name: "Framework Display Name"
description: |
  [Comprehensive framework description]

# EARLY: Essential cognitive priming elements
expert_role: |
  You are an expert analyst with specialized knowledge relevant to this framework's
  theoretical domain. This establishes analytical perspective before encountering
  framework components and guides interpretation of language cues and concepts.

methodological_approach: |
  High-level analytical methodology that affects how framework components should
  be interpreted. Places LLM in appropriate analytical mode before processing
  detailed framework structure.

# MIDDLE: Framework structure definitions
components:
  [Complete framework component definitions]

axes:
  [Axis definitions with anchor references]

competitive_relationships:
  [Competition modeling configurations]

# LATE: Detailed prompts referencing framework elements
detailed_prompts:
  specific_analysis_guidance: |
    Detailed instructions that reference specific components, language_cues,
    competitive_relationships, and other framework elements defined above.
    These can safely use forward references because the elements exist.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Precise scoring instructions that reference specific anchor definitions,
    competition_pairs, and metrics defined in the framework structure.
```

### **Cognitive Processing Benefits**

**Early Context Setting Advantages:**
- **Cognitive Priming**: LLM knows analytical perspective before encountering technical elements
- **Domain Contextualization**: Proper theoretical context for interpreting language cues
- **Methodological Frame**: Analysis approach guides framework component interpretation
- **No Forward References**: Early elements don't reference undefined framework components

**Late Detailed Prompts Advantages:**
- **Technical Precision**: Can reference specific framework elements with confidence
- **Forward Reference Resolution**: All referenced elements have been defined
- **Implementation Details**: Specific guidance for applying framework components
- **Embedded Context Clarity**: Works seamlessly when framework is embedded in experiments

### **Implementation Guidelines**

**For Framework Developers:**

**Required Sequence:**
1. **Framework Metadata** (name, version, description)
2. **Early Context Setting** (expert_role, methodological_approach)
3. **Framework Structure** (components, axes, competitive_relationships)
4. **Late Detailed Prompts** (detailed analysis guidance referencing framework elements)

**Early Context Elements:**
```yaml
expert_role: |
  Establish domain expertise and analytical perspective without referencing
  specific framework components. Focus on theoretical domain and approach.

methodological_approach: |
  High-level methodology that guides framework interpretation. Should work
  for any framework in this theoretical family.
```

**Late Detailed Elements:**
```yaml
detailed_prompts:
  component_application: |
    Specific guidance for applying framework components, referencing actual
    language_cues, competition_pairs, and metrics defined above.
  
  scoring_precision: |
    Detailed scoring instructions that reference specific framework elements
    and use precise technical terminology from component definitions.
```

**For Experiment System Integration:**

When frameworks are embedded in experiments, this architecture ensures:
- **Proper Context Layering**: Experiment ‚Üí Framework ‚Üí Analysis guidance
- **Sequential Processing**: Each layer builds on previous context
- **Reference Resolution**: No broken forward references
- **Cognitive Clarity**: LLM understanding improves with each processing layer

### **Theoretical Foundation**

**LLM Sequential Processing Research**: Studies of LLM attention mechanisms demonstrate that early context significantly affects interpretation of later content. Cognitive priming through early expert role and methodological guidance improves accuracy of framework component interpretation.

**Framework Embedding Context**: Unlike standalone frameworks, embedded frameworks must account for experiment-level context and sequential processing constraints. The dual-phase prompt architecture addresses these constraints while maintaining framework precision.

**Cross-Reference**: For complete implementation details and experiment-specific considerations, see **[Experiment System Specification v3.2 - Framework Embedding Optimization](Discernus_Experiment_System_Specification_v3.2.0.md#framework-embedding-optimization)**.

## üèóÔ∏è **HYBRID AXES-ANCHORS ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICATION**

### **Hybrid Architecture Overview**

The v3.2 specification introduces a **recommended hybrid approach** that clarifies the relationship between axes and anchors while maintaining backward compatibility. This architecture provides structural rigor with human-readable clarity.

### **Core Principles**

**1. Anchors as Independent Components**
- All anchors must be registered as independent components in a top-level `components` section
- Each anchor has a unique `component_id` for reference and computational processing
- Full anchor definitions include positioning, weights, language cues, and theoretical grounding

**2. Axes Reference Exactly Two Anchors by ID (Polar Constraint)**
- Axes define bipolar relationships between exactly two anchor components by referencing their `component_id` values
- Axes specify `anchor_ids` array containing exactly 2 anchor IDs (mathematical requirement for true axes)
- Axes may include additional relationship properties (theoretical basis, validation method, pole assignments)
- **Critical Constraint**: Axes MUST contain exactly 2 anchors to maintain mathematical rigor and interpretability

**3. Anchor Summary for Rapid Comprehension**
- **Recommended**: Axes include an `anchor_summary` block mapping anchor IDs to brief descriptions
- Enables rapid understanding without dereferencing full component definitions
- Optimizes both human comprehension and LLM processing efficiency

### **Quick Reference: Minimal Valid Framework**

```yaml
# Minimal hybrid framework example
name: simple_demo
version: v3.2

# Component registry (required)
components:
  concept_a:
    component_id: concept_a
    angle: 0
    weight: 1.0
    description: "First theoretical concept"
  concept_b:
    component_id: concept_b
    angle: 180
    weight: 1.0
    description: "Opposing theoretical concept"

# Axes (exactly 2 anchors each)
axes:
  MainDimension:
    anchor_ids: [concept_a, concept_b]
    description: "Primary theoretical dimension"
    anchor_summary:
      concept_a: "First pole"
      concept_b: "Second pole"
```

### **Implementation Guidelines**

**For Framework Developers:**
- **Required**: Register all anchors as independent components with unique IDs
- **Required**: Reference exactly 2 anchors in each axis using `anchor_ids` array (polar constraint)
- **Required**: Ensure true oppositional relationship between axis poles for mathematical validity
- **Recommended**: Include `anchor_summary` in axes for clarity and usability
- **Optional**: Migrate existing frameworks gradually (legacy format remains valid)
- **Important**: If you need 3+ reference points, use anchor-set framework instead of multi-anchor axes

**When to Use Anchor-Set Instead of Axes:**
- **Multiple reference points**: "Left-Center-Right" ‚Üí Use 3 independent anchors, not 1 axis
- **Non-oppositional concepts**: Concepts that don't form true polar opposites
- **Categorical dimensions**: Nominal categories rather than continuous spectra
- **Complex theoretical space**: Multiple theoretical positions without clear binary opposition

**For LLM and API Consumers:**
- **Primary**: Use `anchor_summary` within axes for rapid context and processing
- **Secondary**: Reference full component definitions for detailed analysis and computation
- **Validation**: Ensure anchor IDs in axes match component IDs in components section

**For System Implementers:**
- **Validation**: Verify anchor ID consistency between components and axes sections
- **Processing**: Support both hybrid and legacy formats seamlessly
- **Migration**: Provide tools for converting legacy formats to hybrid approach

### **Theoretical Justification: Polar Constraint**

**Mathematical Rigor**: Traditional coordinate systems, factor analysis, and psychometric frameworks define axes as having exactly two endpoints. This constraint ensures:
- **Clear interpretation**: Each axis represents a single dimensional continuum
- **Mathematical soundness**: Distance calculations and interpolation are unambiguous  
- **Cognitive clarity**: LLMs and researchers expect axes to mean "between two extremes"
- **Statistical validity**: Avoids ill-defined multi-point scales that reduce analytical precision

**Framework Selection Guidance**:
- **2 Reference Points**: Use axis-set framework (e.g., "Populism vs Pluralism")
- **3+ Reference Points**: Use anchor-set framework (e.g., "Left, Center, Right" as independent anchors)
- **Non-oppositional Concepts**: Use anchor-set framework for concepts without true polarity

### **Edge Cases and Common Questions**

**Q: What if I need 3 or more reference points along a dimension?**
A: Use an **anchor-set framework** instead of axes. Example:
```yaml
# CORRECT for 3+ points:
anchors:
  left: { angle: 45, description: "Progressive position" }
  center: { angle: 135, description: "Moderate position" }  
  right: { angle: 225, description: "Conservative position" }

# WRONG - violates polar constraint:
# axes:
#   PoliticalSpectrum:
#     anchor_ids: [left, center, right]  # Invalid!
```

**Q: Can I reuse anchors across multiple axes?**
A: Yes! This is encouraged for frameworks analyzing overlapping theoretical dimensions:
```yaml
components:
  freedom: { component_id: freedom, angle: 0 }
  security: { component_id: security, angle: 180 }
  equality: { component_id: equality, angle: 90 }
  hierarchy: { component_id: hierarchy, angle: 270 }

axes:
  Liberty: { anchor_ids: [freedom, security] }
  SocialOrder: { anchor_ids: [equality, hierarchy] }
  # freedom and security can be reused in other axes
```

**Q: What if my concepts aren't truly oppositional?**
A: Use **anchor-set framework**. True axes require genuine opposition:
```yaml
# GOOD for axes (true opposites):
# Democracy axis: [pluralism, populism]
# Authority axis: [liberalism, authoritarianism]

# BETTER as anchor-set (not truly oppositional):
anchors:
  economic_focus: { angle: 0 }
  cultural_focus: { angle: 120 }
  environmental_focus: { angle: 240 }
```

**Q: How do I handle overlapping or similar concepts?**
A: Ensure sufficient semantic separation (minimum 45¬∞ recommended):
```yaml
# GOOD - clear separation:
components:
  nationalism: { angle: 0 }
  cosmopolitanism: { angle: 180 }  # Clear opposition

# PROBLEMATIC - too similar:
# nationalism: { angle: 0 }
# patriotism: { angle: 15 }  # Too similar, poor separation
```

**Q: Can axes share anchor summaries with different descriptions?**
A: anchor_summary should be consistent across axes referencing the same anchor:
```yaml
# GOOD - consistent summaries:
axes:
  Dimension1:
    anchor_ids: [freedom, security]
    anchor_summary:
      freedom: "Individual liberty and autonomy"  # Consistent
  Dimension2:
    anchor_ids: [freedom, equality]
    anchor_summary:
      freedom: "Individual liberty and autonomy"  # Same description
```

### **Backward Compatibility Guarantee**

The hybrid approach is **fully backward compatible**:
- Existing frameworks with inline anchor definitions remain valid
- Legacy axis formats continue to function without modification  
- New frameworks SHOULD adopt hybrid format for enhanced clarity and extensibility
- Mixed approaches (some hybrid, some legacy) are supported during transition
- **Breaking Change**: New frameworks must satisfy polar constraint (2 anchors per axis)

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert analyst of theoretical discourse with deep knowledge of 
    multi-dimensional conceptual relationships, competitive dynamics between ideas,
    and temporal evolution patterns in complex discourse systems.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Evaluate theoretical positioning across multiple dimensions simultaneously,
    detecting competitive relationships between concepts, theoretical weighting variations,
    and temporal evolution patterns without imposing normative judgments on 
    theoretical orientations.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Analyze discourse for multi-layered theoretical positioning, competitive 
    dynamics between concepts, clustered semantic relationships, and evolutionary
    patterns. Consider both explicit theoretical statements and implicit assumptions
    about conceptual relationships and temporal development.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Provide precise 0.0-1.0 scores with detailed textual evidence. Account for
    competitive relationships between concepts, theoretical weighting effects, and
    temporal positioning. Consider theoretical clustering and hierarchical
    importance when assigning scores across multiple dimensions.
    
  # v3.2 Enhanced Instructions
  competitive_dynamics_detection: |
    Identify instances where multiple theoretical concepts compete for discursive
    space, creating dilution effects or semantic crowding. Look for evidence of
    ideological tension, conceptual trade-offs, and competitive relationships
    between theoretical frameworks within the same discourse.
    
  temporal_pattern_recognition: |
    Detect evolution patterns, consistency changes, and directional shifts in
    theoretical positioning. Identify gradual drift, sudden changes, cyclical
    patterns, and acceleration/deceleration in conceptual emphasis over time.
    
  weighting_awareness_instructions: |
    Consider semantic clustering effects and weighting variations when interpreting
    theoretical positioning. Account for anchor concentration effects and 
    systematic biases introduced by clustered positioning strategies.
    
  # v3.2 Enhancement: Hybrid Axes-Anchors LLM Guidance
  hybrid_architecture_consumption: |
    Consumers SHOULD use the `anchor_summary` block within each axis (when provided) 
    to facilitate rapid understanding of the anchor positions without dereferencing 
    IDs in the components section. For full analytic or computational purposes, 
    anchors MUST be defined and referenced by their unique `component_id`.
    
    When processing axes with `anchor_ids`, prioritize the `anchor_summary` for 
    immediate context while maintaining awareness that complete anchor definitions 
    exist in the components section for detailed analysis.

## üß† **LLM-OPTIMIZED PROMPTING ARCHITECTURE**

### **Core Principle: Make the Right Thing Easy**

The v3.2 specification introduces **systematic prompting guidelines** that make LLM-optimized patterns the default, easy path for framework authors. This eliminates the need to discover optimal prompting patterns independently.

### **The Five-Phase Prompting Architecture**

Based on LLM sequential processing research, optimal framework prompts follow a **five-phase cognitive flow**:

```yaml
# PHASE 1: COGNITIVE PRIMING (No forward references)
expert_role: |
  Establish domain expertise and analytical perspective.
  Language should match text language for analysis.
  No references to specific framework components.

# PHASE 2: FRAMEWORK METHODOLOGY (High-level approach)  
methodological_approach: |
  High-level methodology that guides framework interpretation.
  Should work for any framework in this theoretical family.
  Sets analytical frame before technical details.

# PHASE 3: FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE (Complete technical definitions)
components: {...}    # All anchor definitions with language_cues
axes: {...}         # Axis relationships  
competitive_relationships: {...}  # Competition modeling

# PHASE 4: DETAILED ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS (Reference framework elements)
detailed_analysis_instructions: |
  Comprehensive guidance that references specific components,
  language_cues, and relationships defined in Phase 3.
  Can safely use forward references because elements exist.

# PHASE 5: OUTPUT SPECIFICATION (Complete examples)
output_format: |
  Complete JSON structure with examples in target language.
  Shows exactly what the expected output should look like.
```

### **Language Consistency Principle**

**Rule**: All prompting elements must use **consistent language** that matches the analysis target:
- **Brazilian Portuguese texts** ‚Üí All prompts in Portuguese
- **English texts** ‚Üí All prompts in English
- **Mixed corpus** ‚Üí Use framework's primary language consistently

**Anti-Pattern** (breaks LLM processing):
```yaml
# WRONG - Language switching within single framework
expert_role: |
  You are an expert analyst...  # English

analysis_methodology: |
  An√°lise sistem√°tica de...     # Portuguese  

# This creates cognitive disruption
```

**Correct Pattern**:
```yaml
# RIGHT - Consistent language throughout
expert_role: |
  Voc√™ √© um especialista...     # Portuguese

analysis_methodology: |  
  An√°lise sistem√°tica de...     # Portuguese

# Maintains cognitive coherence
```

### **Framework Prompting Templates**

#### **Template 1: Political Discourse Analysis (Brazilian Portuguese)**

```yaml
# Use this template for Brazilian political discourse frameworks
prompting_architecture:
  # PHASE 1: COGNITIVE PRIMING
  expert_role: |
    Voc√™ √© um especialista em an√°lise de discurso pol√≠tico brasileiro com profundo 
    conhecimento de [THEORETICAL_DOMAIN]. Voc√™ possui expertise espec√≠fica em

        "evidence": "[cita√ß√£o direta do texto em portugu√™s]",
        "reasoning": "[justificativa baseada nos indicadores do framework]"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **CR√çTICO**: Sempre inclua evid√™ncia textual em portugu√™s e racioc√≠nio 
    baseado nos indicadores espec√≠ficos do framework.
```

#### **Template 2: English Academic Analysis**

```yaml
# Use this template for English academic discourse frameworks
prompting_architecture:
  # PHASE 1: COGNITIVE PRIMING
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert analyst of [DISCOURSE_TYPE] with deep knowledge of 
    [THEORETICAL_DOMAIN]. You specialize in [METHODOLOGY_NAME] using established 
    academic frameworks for analyzing [CONTENT_TYPE].
    
    Your task is to analyze [TEXT_TYPE] using the [FRAMEWORK_NAME], focusing 
    on [PRIMARY_DIMENSIONS].

  # PHASE 2: FRAMEWORK METHODOLOGY
  methodological_approach: |
    **ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:**
    
    Apply the [FRAMEWORK_NAME] with [STRUCTURE_TYPE]:
    - **[DIMENSION_1]**: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]
    - **[DIMENSION_2]**: [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]
    
    Evaluate each dimension independently to avoid halo effects, focusing on 
    specific linguistic indicators and textual evidence defined in the framework.

  # PHASE 3: Framework structure goes here

  # PHASE 4: DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS  
  detailed_analysis_instructions: |
    **DETAILED ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:**
    
    **For [ANCHOR_1]** (angle [ANGLE]¬∞):
    - Look for: [CORE_INDICATORS]
    - Key indicators: [LANGUAGE_CUES_LIST]
    - Focus on: [FOCUS_AREAS]
    
    **For [ANCHOR_2]** (angle [ANGLE]¬∞):
    - Look for: [CORE_INDICATORS]
    - Key indicators: [LANGUAGE_CUES_LIST]
    - Focus on: [FOCUS_AREAS]
    
    [REPEAT_FOR_ALL_ANCHORS]

  # PHASE 5: OUTPUT FORMAT
  output_format: |
    Return a JSON object with the [NUMBER] dimensions. Each entry should contain:
    
    ```json
    {
      "[ANCHOR_1]": {
        "score": 0.0-1.0,
        "evidence": "[direct quote from text]",
        "reasoning": "[brief justification based on framework indicators]"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **CRITICAL**: Always include textual evidence and reasoning based on 
    specific framework indicators.
```

### **Prompting Quality Validation**

Framework authors should validate their prompting using this checklist:

#### **‚úÖ Language Consistency Check**
- [ ] All prompting elements use the same language
- [ ] Language matches the target text corpus language  
- [ ] No mid-prompt language switching
- [ ] Cultural/regional context appropriate (e.g., Brazilian Portuguese vs European Portuguese)

#### **‚úÖ Sequential Flow Check**
- [ ] Phase 1: Context established before framework details
- [ ] Phase 2: Methodology explained before technical components
- [ ] Phase 3: All framework elements defined before being referenced
- [ ] Phase 4: Detailed instructions reference existing framework elements
- [ ] Phase 5: Complete output examples provided

#### **‚úÖ Forward Reference Check**
- [ ] Early prompts don't reference undefined framework components
- [ ] All referenced elements exist in framework structure
- [ ] References use exact component_ids and language_cues
- [ ] No broken or circular references

#### **‚úÖ Cognitive Load Check**
- [ ] Expert role establishes domain without overwhelming detail
- [ ] Each section has single, clear purpose
- [ ] Instructions progress from general to specific
- [ ] Examples are complete and realistic
- [ ] Total prompt length manageable (< 3000 words recommended)

### **Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

#### **‚ùå Anti-Pattern 1: Language Inconsistency**
```yaml
# WRONG
expert_role: |
  You are an expert analyst...          # English
analysis_instructions: |
  Procure por ret√≥rica anti-elite...     # Portuguese
```

#### **‚ùå Anti-Pattern 2: Forward References**
```yaml
# WRONG  
expert_role: |
  Apply the language_cues defined in the components section below...
# Problem: components section doesn't exist yet in LLM context
```

#### **‚ùå Anti-Pattern 3: Information Fragmentation**
```yaml
# WRONG
prompt_guidance:
  role_definition: "Brief role"
  framework_instructions: "Brief framework"  
  scoring_requirements: "Brief scoring"
  json_format: "Brief format"
# Problem: Information scattered, no logical flow
```

#### **‚ùå Anti-Pattern 4: Technical Details First**
```yaml  
# WRONG
expert_role: |
  Score the populism anchor at angle 90¬∞ using language_cues...
# Problem: Technical details before cognitive context
```

### **Implementation Guidelines for Framework Authors**

#### **Step 1: Choose Language**
Determine target corpus language and use consistently throughout all prompting elements.

#### **Step 2: Use Template**  
Select appropriate template (Brazilian Portuguese Political, English Academic, etc.) and fill in framework-specific details.

#### **Step 3: Validate Flow**
Ensure prompting follows five-phase architecture with proper forward reference resolution.

#### **Step 4: Test with Examples**
Include complete, realistic JSON examples that demonstrate expected output format.

#### **Step 5: Quality Check**
Run through validation checklist to catch common anti-patterns.

### **Framework Specification Integration**

The prompting architecture integrates seamlessly with other v3.2 features:

```yaml
# Complete framework with optimized prompting
name: example_framework
version: v3.2

# Standard framework structure
components: {...}
axes: {...}
competitive_relationships: {...}

# LLM-Optimized prompting (follows five-phase architecture)
prompting_architecture:
  expert_role: |
    [Phase 1: Cognitive priming]
  methodological_approach: |
    [Phase 2: Framework methodology]
  detailed_analysis_instructions: |
    [Phase 4: Component-referencing instructions]
  output_format: |
    [Phase 5: Complete examples]
  
# Other v3.2 features
temporal_analysis: {...}
framework_fit_metrics: {...}
```

This architecture ensures framework authors naturally create LLM-optimized prompts without needing to understand the underlying cognitive processing principles.
