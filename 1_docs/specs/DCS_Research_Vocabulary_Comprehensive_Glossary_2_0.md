### **Practical YAML Examples**

**Hybrid Architecture Example:**
```yaml
# Component registry defines anchors once
components:
  liberal:
    component_id: liberal
    angle: 90
    description: "Progressive political orientation"
  conservative:
    component_id: conservative  
    angle: 270
    description: "Traditional political orientation"

# Axes reference exactly 2 anchors (polar constraint)
axes:
  PoliticalSpectrum:
    anchor_ids: [liberal, conservative]
    anchor_summary:
      liberal: "Progressive policies and social change"
      conservative: "Traditional values and institutions"
```

**Multi-Reference Decision Example:**
```yaml
# WRONG: Trying to put 3+ anchors in one axis
# axes:
#   PoliticalSpectrum:
#     anchor_ids: [left, center, right]  # Violates polar constraint!

# CORRECT: Use anchor-set framework for 3+ reference points
anchors:
  left:
    angle: 45
    description: "Progressive political position"
  center:
    angle: 135  
    description: "Moderate political position"
  right:
    angle: 225
    description: "Conservative political position"
```

**Anchor Reuse Example:**
```yaml
# Anchors can be reused across multiple axes
components:
  freedom: { component_id: freedom, angle: 0 }
  security: { component_id: security, angle: 180 }
  equality: { component_id: equality, angle: 90 }

axes:
  CivilLiberties: { anchor_ids: [freedom, security] }
  SocialJustice: { anchor_ids: [equality, security] }
  # 'security' anchor is reused in both axes
```
