description: |
  The Entman Framing Functions Framework implements Robert Entman's systematic communication 
  analysis through four independent framing functions with advanced multi-dimensional analysis 
  capabilities. This framework tests whether Problem Definition, Causal Attribution, Moral 
  Evaluation, and Treatment Recommendation operate independently as predicted by communication 
  theory, representing "frames in communication" systematic message construction.

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert analyst of strategic communication and political framing, with deep knowledge 
    of Robert Entman's framing theory and systematic message construction. You specialize in 
    analyzing how political communications utilize problem definition, causal attribution, 
    moral evaluation, and treatment recommendation functions.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Analyze this text to identify Entman's four framing functions: Problem Definition (what issues 
    require attention), Causal Attribution (what/who caused problems), Moral Evaluation (what values 
    are invoked), and Treatment Recommendation (what solutions are proposed). Test whether these 
    functions operate independently as predicted by communication theory.
  
  competitive_dynamics_detection: |
    Identify instances where framing functions compete for limited discursive space, creating 
    message complexity or strategic trade-offs. Look for evidence of function crowding and 
    how strategic communication manages function integration versus independence.

  theoretical_approach: |
    Enhanced communication theory implementation with advanced multi-dimensional analysis 
    capabilities including competitive dynamics modeling, temporal evolution tracking, and 
    framework fit validation. Tests Entman's systematic communication analysis theory that 
    framing operates through four distinct, independent functions that can vary separately 
    to achieve strategic communication goals.
