# Last Modified: 2025‑06‑27 (Migrated to v3.2 with advanced multi-dimensional analysis)

name: political_worldview_triad_with_populism_booster
version: v3.2
display_name: "Political Worldview Triad Framework + Populism/Pluralism Boosters"

description: |
  This framework extends the standard Three‑Anchor Worldview Framework by overlaying an
  orthogonal Populism ↔ Pluralism style axis with v3.2 enhanced analysis capabilities,
  implemented as algorithmic boosters that selectively amplify anti‑elite or institutionalist 
  rhetoric once detected beyond configurable thresholds.
  
  ## v3.2 Enhanced Capabilities
  
  ### Advanced Multi-Dimensional Analysis
  - **Competitive Dynamics**: Mathematical modeling of worldview and style competition
  - **Framework Fit Validation**: Comprehensive metrics with booster integration
  - **Temporal Evolution**: Tracking both worldview and style changes over time
  - **Olympics Protocols**: Systematic comparison with other hybrid frameworks

    description: |
      Politics that grounds moral status in overlapping unchosen attributes — race,

  expert_role: |
    You are an expert in political worldviews and democratic styles. Analyse the text
    to (1) locate its substantive worldview among Immutable‑Identity, Tribal Domination,
    or Pluralist Individual Dignity; and (2) score Populism_Intensity and Pluralism_Intensity
    from 0.0–1.0 based on anti‑elite versus institutionalist rhetoric.
    
  competitive_dynamics_detection: |
    Identify instances where worldviews and democratic styles compete for discursive space,
    creating complex ideological tensions and amplification effects. Analyze how populist
    or pluralist styles interact with different worldview foundations.

  theoretical_approach: |
    Enhanced implementation integrating identity‑based justice theory, realist group conflict, 
    and liberal egalitarian dignity into a geometric worldview model with advanced multi-dimensional 
    analysis capabilities, overlaid with thin‑centred populism concept and countervailing pluralism 
    using competitive dynamics modeling and temporal evolution tracking.
