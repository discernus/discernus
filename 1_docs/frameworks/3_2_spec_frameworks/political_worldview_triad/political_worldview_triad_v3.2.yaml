display_name: "Political Worldview Triad Framework"

description: |
  Triadic worldview mapping framework within the Discernus Coordinate System (DCS) with 
  advanced multi-dimensional analysis capabilities. It scores political discourse along 
  three distinct sources of legitimacy—Immutable-Identity, Tribal Domination, and 
  Pluralist Individual Dignity—with v3.2 enhanced analysis features.
  
  ## v3.2 Enhanced Capabilities
  
  ### Advanced Multi-Dimensional Analysis
  - **Competitive Dynamics**: Mathematical modeling of worldview competition
  - **Framework Fit Validation**: Comprehensive metrics for political theory coverage
  - **Temporal Evolution**: Tracking worldview positioning changes over time
  - **Olympics Protocols**: Systematic comparison with other political frameworks
  - **Arc Positioning**: Semantic density modeling for worldview clusters

anchors:
  Immutable-Identity:
    angle: 90
    weight: 1.0
    type: worldview
    tier: primary
    description: |
      Politics that centres moral status on overlapping, unchosen personal attributes
      (race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, neurotype, etc.),
      viewing these traits as the primary source of advantage or oppression.
    language_cues:
      - "As Black women, we..."
      - "Center disabled queer voices."
      - "Our lived experience as trans people shows..."
      - "Marginalised identities face systemic barriers."
      - "Racialised communities continue to struggle."
      - "systemic oppression"
      - "lived experience"
      - "intersection of race and gender"

    You are a political-discourse classifier that assigns each text a score
    to three worldview anchors: Immutable-Identity, Tribal Domination,
    Pluralist Individual Dignity. Analyze competitive dynamics between these
    worldviews and temporal evolution patterns.

  competitive_dynamics_detection: |
    Identify instances where different worldviews compete for discursive space,
    creating ideological tension or dilution effects. Look for evidence of
    worldview conflicts and competitive relationships between identity-based,
    dominance-based, and dignity-based frameworks.

  theoretical_approach: |
    Enhanced political theory implementation with advanced multi-dimensional analysis 
    capabilities including competitive dynamics modeling, temporal evolution tracking, 
    and framework fit validation. Synthesizes intersectionality theory (Crenshaw), 
    realist political theory (Machiavelli), and liberal dignity theory (Kant) into 
    a triangular measurement space for contemporary political discourse analysis.
