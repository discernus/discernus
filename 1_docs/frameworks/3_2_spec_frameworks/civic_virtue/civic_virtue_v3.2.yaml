version: v3.2
display_name: "Civic Virtue Framework"

description: |
  Enhanced civic virtue framework with advanced multi-dimensional analysis capabilities.
  
  ## Theoretical Foundation
  
  Based on Aristotelian virtue ethics and contemporary civic republican theory, this framework 
  examines civic virtues and vices in political communication:
  
  - **Classical Foundation**: Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics* (Book VI) on virtue and character
  - **Contemporary Application**: Sandel's civic republican theory on moral limits and civic engagement
  - **Core Insight**: Democratic discourse quality depends on the balance of civic virtues versus civic vices
  
  ## v3.2 Enhanced Capabilities
  
  ### Advanced Multi-Dimensional Analysis
  - **Arc Positioning**: Theoretical weighting modeling with virtue/vice clustering
  - **Competitive Dynamics**: Analysis of moral tension and virtue-vice competition
  - **Framework Fit Validation**: Comprehensive metrics for civic virtue theory coverage
  - **Temporal Evolution**: Tracking moral positioning changes in discourse over time
  - **Olympics Protocols**: Systematic comparison with other political morality frameworks
  
  ### Framework Architecture
  
  - **Virtue Cluster (Top)**: 5 anchors clustered around 90° emphasizing civic strengths
  - **Vice Cluster (Bottom)**: 5 anchors clustered around 270° emphasizing civic weaknesses
  - **Moral Hierarchy**: Vertical orientation emphasizing virtue-vice distinction
  - **Competitive Modeling**: Mathematical representation of moral tension
  
  ### The Ten Civic Dimensions
  
  **Civic Virtues (Integrative Anchors):**
  1. **Dignity** - Individual moral worth and universal human dignity
  2. **Truth** - Factual accuracy and intellectual honesty
  3. **Justice** - Fairness, proportionality, and procedural equity
  4. **Hope** - Constructive vision and democratic optimism
  5. **Pragmatism** - Practical solutions and workable compromise
  
  **Civic Vices (Disintegrative Anchors):**
  1. **Tribalism** - Group loyalty over universal principles
  2. **Resentment** - Grievance, victimization, and blame
  3. **Manipulation** - Deceptive rhetoric and emotional exploitation
  4. **Fear** - Anxiety appeals and catastrophic thinking
  5. **Fantasy** - Unrealistic expectations and magical thinking
  
  ## Usage Guidelines
  
  ### Ideal Applications
  - Political speech analysis for civic virtue content
  - Democratic discourse quality assessment
  - Campaign communication ethics evaluation
  - Public debate moral dimension analysis
  
  ## Version History
  
  v3.2: Framework Specification v3.2 compliant with advanced multi-dimensional analysis,
        competitive dynamics modeling, temporal evolution tracking, and Olympics validation.
  v1.0: Framework Specification v3.1 compliant version with complete 10-anchor restoration.

# =============================================================================
# LLM INTEGRATION (enhanced)
# =============================================================================

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert analyst of civic life and democratic participation, with deep 
    knowledge of civic republican theory and social capital research. You specialize 
    in analyzing how discourse either promotes or undermines civic engagement through 
    virtue and vice patterns.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Evaluate how the text demonstrates civic virtues (dignity, truth, justice, hope, pragmatism) 
    OR civic vices (tribalism, resentment, manipulation, fear, fantasy). Focus specifically on 
    moral dimensions that strengthen or weaken democratic discourse and civic participation.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for patterns that either encourage civic virtues and democratic participation 
    or express civic vices and democratic withdrawal. Analyze both explicit moral 
    language and implicit assumptions about civic responsibility, democratic institutions, 
    and community involvement.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Score civic dimensions based on textual evidence of virtue/vice emphasis, using 
    0.0-1.0 scale with specific quotations supporting each assessment. Focus on 
    civic frameworks rather than specific policy positions. Consider hierarchical 
    weighting: primary (1.0), secondary (0.8), tertiary (0.6).

  # v3.2 Enhancement: Advanced Analysis Instructions
  competitive_dynamics_detection: |
    Identify instances where civic virtues and vices compete for discursive space, 
    creating moral tension or dilution effects. Look for evidence of virtue-vice 
    conflicts, moral trade-offs, and competitive relationships between different 
    civic orientations within the same discourse.
    
  temporal_pattern_recognition: |
    Detect evolution patterns in civic positioning, moral consistency changes, and 
    directional shifts in virtue-vice balance. Identify moral drift, virtue decay, 
    civic restoration patterns, and acceleration/deceleration in moral emphasis.
    
  theoretical_weighting_awareness_instructions: |
    Consider moral clustering effects and theoretical weighting variations when interpreting civic 
    positioning. Account for virtue-vice concentration effects and systematic biases 
    introduced by clustered moral positioning strategies.

  theoretical_approach: |
    Enhanced civic republican tradition and social capital theory implementation with 
    advanced multi-dimensional analysis capabilities including competitive dynamics 
    modeling, temporal evolution tracking, and framework fit validation. Analyzes 
    how discourse either strengthens or weakens civic bonds and democratic participation 
    through clustered moral positioning.
  
  validation_methodology: |
    Complete description of Olympics validation protocols, framework fit assessment 
    procedures, competitive dynamics validation, temporal coherence testing, and 
    cross-framework comparison standards for civic virtue frameworks. Includes 
    mathematical foundations and statistical significance testing approaches.
    
  innovation_contributions: |
    Novel arc clustering methodology for civic virtue domains, competitive dynamics 
    modeling between moral orientations, temporal coherence tracking for civic 
    evolution, and advanced theoretical weighting modeling for virtue-vice competition analysis.
