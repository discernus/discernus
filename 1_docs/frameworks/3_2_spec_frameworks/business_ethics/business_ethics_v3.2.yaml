description: |
  The Business Ethics Framework analyzes business communications across three domains of ethical 
  concern: stakeholder relationships, operational integrity, and strategic vision using advanced 
  multi-dimensional analysis capabilities.
  
  ## Theoretical Foundation
  
  Based on Freeman's stakeholder theory and Solomon's ethics approach, this framework examines 
  business ethics through three distinct domains that represent core areas of corporate 
  responsibility. The framework implements stakeholder-based ethical analysis with domain-specific 
  clustering, demonstrating how different ethical concerns manifest in distinct areas of business operation.
  
  ### Three Domains of Business Ethics
  
  **1. Stakeholder Relations Domain** - How businesses treat key stakeholders:
  - **Customer Relations**: Service orientation vs exploitation patterns
  - **Employee Relations**: Development investment vs resource extraction approaches
  
  **2. Operational Integrity Domain** - How businesses manage governance and operations:
  - **Governance Transparency**: Accountability vs opacity in decision-making
  - **Financial Integrity**: Responsible management vs manipulation practices
  
  **3. Strategic Vision Domain** - How businesses frame long-term purpose:
  - **Strategic Purpose**: Sustainable value creation vs short-term extraction focus
  
  ## v3.2 Enhanced Capabilities
  
  ### Advanced Multi-Dimensional Analysis
  - **Arc Positioning**: Semantic density modeling within ethics domains
  - **Competitive Dynamics**: Analysis of competing ethical frameworks within discourse
  - **Framework Fit Validation**: Comprehensive metrics for stakeholder theory coverage
  - **Temporal Evolution**: Tracking ethical positioning changes over time
  - **Cross-Framework Comparison**: Standardized ethics framework comparison protocols
  
  ### Hybrid Axes-Anchors Architecture
  - **Component Registry**: All ethical anchors defined as independent components
  - **Polar Constraint Enforcement**: Each axis represents exactly two opposing concepts
  - **Anchor Summary Integration**: Rapid comprehension without sacrificing precision
  
  ## Usage Guidelines
  
  ### Appropriate Applications
  - Corporate communication analysis for stakeholder orientation evaluation
  - ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) messaging consistency assessment
  - Stakeholder capitalism vs shareholder primacy positioning analysis
  - Corporate governance transparency and accountability evaluation

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert business ethics analyst specializing in stakeholder capitalism, 
    corporate governance, and sustainable business practices with deep knowledge of 
    ethical frameworks for evaluating business communications and corporate responsibility.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Evaluate how business communications demonstrate ethical orientation across three 
    domains: stakeholder relationships, operational integrity, and strategic vision. 
    Analyze whether communications prioritize stakeholder capitalism or shareholder 
    primacy across these distinct business responsibility areas.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for ethical positioning patterns within each domain cluster - stakeholder 
    relations (customer/employee treatment), operational integrity (governance/financial 
    practices), and strategic vision (long-term purpose). Note clustering patterns 
    within each domain and overall stakeholder vs shareholder orientation.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Score each axis pole on 0.0-1.0 scale based on presence/strength of ethical 
    orientation in the text, with specific textual evidence. Consider domain-specific 
    clustering and how different business ethics concerns manifest in distinct areas 
    of corporate communication.

    Use the `anchor_summary` block within each axis for rapid understanding of anchor 
    positions. For complete analysis, reference full component definitions in the 
    components section. Prioritize anchor_summary for immediate context while 
    maintaining awareness of detailed component definitions for computational analysis.
    
  competitive_dynamics_detection: |
    Identify instances where multiple ethical frameworks compete for discursive space, 
    creating dilution effects or semantic crowding. Look for evidence of ethical tension, 
    stakeholder trade-offs, and competitive relationships between different ethical 
    approaches within the same business communication.
    
  temporal_pattern_recognition: |
    Detect evolution patterns in ethical positioning, consistency changes, and directional 
    shifts in stakeholder orientation. Identify gradual drift, sudden changes, cyclical 
    patterns, and acceleration/deceleration in ethical emphasis over time.
