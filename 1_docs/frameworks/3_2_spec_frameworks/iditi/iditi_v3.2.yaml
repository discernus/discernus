display_name: "Individual Dignity Identity v Tribal Identity"

description: |
  The IDITI framework analyzes the fundamental tension between individual dignity and tribal identity 
  in political discourse with advanced multi-dimensional analysis capabilities. This specialized 
  framework focuses on how texts either affirm universal human worth or prioritize group-based 
  identity and loyalty, examining the core moral question of whether human dignity is universal 
  or conditional on group membership.
  
  ## v3.2 Enhanced Capabilities
  
  ### Advanced Multi-Dimensional Analysis
  - **Competitive Dynamics**: Mathematical modeling of identity-based competition
  - **Framework Fit Validation**: Comprehensive metrics for identity theory coverage
  - **Temporal Evolution**: Tracking identity positioning changes over time
  - **Olympics Protocols**: Systematic comparison with other identity frameworks
  - **Hybrid Architecture**: Components registry with polar constraint enforcement

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert analyst of political identity and group psychology, with deep knowledge 
    of individual dignity theory and tribal psychology. You specialize in analyzing how discourse 
    either affirms universal human dignity or appeals to tribal identity and group loyalty.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Evaluate how the text either affirms individual dignity and universal human worth OR appeals 
    to tribal identity and group-based moral distinctions. Focus specifically on the tension 
    between treating people as individuals with inherent worth versus defining people primarily 
    through group membership and loyalty.
  
  competitive_dynamics_detection: |
    Identify instances where individual dignity and tribal identity compete for discursive space, 
    creating moral tension or dilution effects. Look for evidence of identity conflicts and 
    competitive relationships between universal and group-based moral frameworks.

  theoretical_approach: |
    Enhanced identity formation theory implementation with advanced multi-dimensional analysis 
    capabilities including competitive dynamics modeling, temporal evolution tracking, and 
    framework fit validation. Applies Fukuyama's dignity theory and Jung's collective psychology 
    to analyze how discourse treats human moral worth as universal or group-conditional.
