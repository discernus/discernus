description: |
  Advanced Moral Foundations Theory framework implementing Jonathan Haidt's research 
  with v3.2 competitive dynamics modeling and framework fit validation. This framework 
  analyzes moral reasoning through six foundation pairs with competitive relationships, 
  temporal evolution tracking, and sophisticated density modeling.
  
  ## Theoretical Foundation
  
  Based on Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory which identifies innate psychological foundations 
  that cultures build upon to create diverse moral systems. The theory proposes that human 
  morality is built upon several foundations, not just care and fairness as traditionally 
  emphasized in moral psychology. These foundations evolved to address adaptive challenges 
  faced by humans living in groups.
  
  ### The Six Foundation Pairs
  
  1. **Care ↔ Harm**: Evolved from mammalian attachment and empathy
  2. **Fairness ↔ Cheating**: Evolved from reciprocal altruism
  3. **Loyalty ↔ Betrayal**: Evolved from group cooperation needs
  4. **Authority ↔ Subversion**: Evolved from hierarchical social structures
  5. **Sanctity ↔ Degradation**: Evolved from contamination avoidance
  6. **Liberty ↔ Oppression**: Evolved from responses to domination
  
  ### Political Psychology Insights
  
  - **Liberals**: Primarily rely on individualizing foundations (Care, Fairness)
  - **Conservatives**: Use all foundations more equally
  - **Libertarians**: Emphasize Liberty foundation when included
  
  ## v3.2 Capabilities
  
  - **Competitive Dynamics**: Mathematical modeling of foundation competition and dilution effects
  - **Framework Fit Validation**: Cartographic fidelity and territorial coverage metrics
  - **Temporal Evolution**: Foundation stability tracking and evolution patterns
  - **Olympics Protocols**: Systematic comparison with other moral frameworks
  - **Arc Positioning**: Semantic density modeling for foundation clustering
  - **Density Corrections**: Spatial bias compensation and cross-framework normalization
  
  ## Usage Guidelines
  
  ### Appropriate Text Types
  - Political speeches and statements
  - Policy documents and arguments  
  - Social commentary and opinion pieces
  - Campaign materials and manifestos
  - Legislative debates and justifications
  
  ### Analysis Metrics
  - **Individualizing Score**: Care + Fairness foundation strength
  - **Binding Score**: Loyalty + Authority + Sanctity foundation strength  
  - **Liberty Score**: Liberty vs Oppression positioning
  - **Moral Diversity Index**: Breadth across all foundations
  - **Foundation Competition Index**: Inter-foundation competitive dynamics

    You specialize in identifying implicit moral frameworks and foundation competition effects.
  
  competitive_analysis_focus: |
    Analyze the values, principles, and moral reasoning present in this text, with 
    special attention to competitive relationships between moral foundations. 
    Identify which foundations dominate, which are suppressed, and how they compete for semantic space.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for patterns of moral reasoning and foundation competition including: protection 
    of vulnerable individuals vs group loyalty conflicts, fairness concerns vs authority 
    respect tensions, and liberty vs sanctity trade-offs. Analyze both explicit 
    statements and implicit moral competitive dynamics.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Score moral dimensions based on textual evidence of value emphasis and competitive 
    relationships, using 0.0-1.0 scale with specific quotations supporting each assessment. 
    Account for foundation competition effects and mutual inhibition patterns.
  
  enhanced_detection_instructions: |
    Beyond explicit moral vocabulary, identify: (1) Competitive moral reasoning patterns, 
    (2) Foundation suppression and dominance effects, (3) Temporal stability indicators, 
    (4) Cross-foundation conflict resolution strategies, (5) Semantic space allocation patterns.
