description: |
  The Populism vs Pluralism Framework analyzes the fundamental tension between populist and 
  pluralist approaches to democratic governance with advanced multi-dimensional analysis capabilities. 
  This framework examines how political discourse either promotes singular "will of the people" 
  narratives or embraces democratic pluralism and institutional mediation, representing competing 
  visions of legitimate democratic authority.
  
  ## v3.2 Enhanced Capabilities
  
  ### Advanced Multi-Dimensional Analysis
  - **Competitive Dynamics**: Mathematical modeling of democratic theory competition
  - **Framework Fit Validation**: Comprehensive metrics for democratic theory coverage
  - **Temporal Evolution**: Tracking democratic positioning changes over time
  - **Olympics Protocols**: Systematic comparison with other democratic frameworks
  - **Hybrid Architecture**: Components registry with polar constraint enforcement

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert analyst of democratic theory and political systems, with deep 
    knowledge of populist and pluralist approaches to democratic governance. You 
    specialize in analyzing how discourse supports different visions of legitimate 
    democratic authority and the role of institutions in democratic societies.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Evaluate how the text either supports pluralist democratic institutions and norms 
    OR embraces populist direct democracy and majoritarian sovereignty. Focus specifically 
    on attitudes toward institutional mediation, minority rights, elite legitimacy, 
    and the source of legitimate political authority.
  
  competitive_dynamics_detection: |
    Identify instances where pluralist and populist democratic theories compete for 
    discursive space, creating institutional tension or democratic theory dilution effects. 
    Look for evidence of democratic conflicts and competitive relationships between 
    institutional and anti-institutional frameworks.

  theoretical_approach: |
    Enhanced democratic theory implementation with advanced multi-dimensional analysis 
    capabilities including competitive dynamics modeling, temporal evolution tracking, 
    and framework fit validation. Examines democratic discourse through the lens of 
    populist versus pluralist approaches to legitimate authority using ideational 
    theory of populism and institutional democratic theory.
