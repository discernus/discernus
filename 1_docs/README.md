## Reading Order for New Contributors

1. **Start Here**: `strategy_gate_driven_academic_partnership.md` - Understand the overall strategic direction
2. **Process**: `methodology_validation_gates_process.md` - Learn the development methodology  
3. **Current State**: `platform_technical_capabilities_overview.md` - Review existing technical capabilities
4. **Action Plan**: `implementation_plan_byu_timeline.md` - See the detailed implementation timeline
5. **Future**: `roadmap_post_validation_enhancements.md` - Understand the long-term vision

## Current Focus

**Active Development**: Gates 1-2 validation through enhanced populism/pluralism framework and BYU collaboration

**Decision Point**: Proceed to Jupyter integration (Gates 3-4) only if basic capability validates successfully

**Strategic Goal**: Validate core research value before major platform investment
