# Deprecation Note - January 26, 2025

## Files Deprecated

- `EXPERIMENT_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION_v3.1.0.md` - Aspirational experiment system specification

## Reason for Deprecation

The v3.1.0 experiment specification described an advanced, component-based experiment system with sophisticated academic export capabilities that did not match the actual implementation. This created confusion between documented capabilities and actual system functionality.

## Replacement

- **New Spec**: `specs/EXPERIMENT_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION_v3.2.0.md`
- **Key Changes**: 
  - Documents **actual current capabilities** rather than aspirational features
  - Focuses on production-ready multi-model statistical comparison system
  - Provides clear roadmap from current state to advanced features
  - Maintains compatibility with Framework Specification v3.2

## Migration Path

- **Current Users**: No changes needed - actual system functionality unchanged
- **Documentation References**: Update to reference v3.2.0 specification
- **Future Development**: Follow v3.2.0 roadmap for feature development

The new specification maintains the same vision and end goals while providing accurate documentation of current capabilities and a realistic development path.
