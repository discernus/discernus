  The Business Ethics Framework analyzes business communications across three domains of ethical 
  concern: stakeholder relationships, operational integrity, and strategic vision. This framework 
  demonstrates flexible anchor clustering within defined business ethics domains, providing 
  systematic analysis of corporate ethical orientation patterns through stakeholder-based analysis.
  
  ## Theoretical Foundation
  
  Based on Freeman's stakeholder theory and Solomon's ethics approach, this framework examines 
  business ethics through three distinct domains that represent core areas of corporate 
  responsibility. The framework implements stakeholder-based ethical analysis with domain-specific 
  clustering, demonstrating how different ethical concerns manifest in distinct areas of business operation.
  
  ### Three Domains of Business Ethics
  
  **1. Stakeholder Relations Domain** - How businesses treat key stakeholders:
  - **Customer Relations**: Service orientation vs exploitation patterns
  - **Employee Relations**: Development investment vs resource extraction approaches
  
  **2. Operational Integrity Domain** - How businesses manage governance and operations:
  - **Governance Transparency**: Accountability vs opacity in decision-making
  - **Financial Integrity**: Responsible management vs manipulation practices
  
  **3. Strategic Vision Domain** - How businesses frame long-term purpose:
  - **Strategic Purpose**: Sustainable value creation vs short-term extraction focus
  
  ## Methodological Innovation
  
  ### Domain Arc Clustering
  This framework tests stakeholder theory through computational analysis:
  - **Stakeholder Relations Arc**: Customer and employee treatment clustered (15° to 75°)
  - **Operational Integrity Arc**: Governance and financial practices clustered (120° to 210°)
  - **Strategic Vision Arc**: Long-term purpose positioning (270° to 360°)
  - **Domain Separation**: Clear analytical boundaries between ethical concern areas
  
  ### Stakeholder vs Shareholder Analysis
  The framework systematically evaluates whether business communications prioritize 
  stakeholder capitalism (multiple stakeholder interests) or shareholder primacy 
  (profit maximization focus) across the three ethical domains.
  
  ## Research Applications
  
  ### Corporate Ethics Assessment
  - Corporate communication analysis for stakeholder orientation evaluation
  - ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) messaging consistency assessment
  - Stakeholder capitalism vs shareholder primacy positioning analysis
  - Corporate governance transparency and accountability evaluation
  
  ### Business Communication Research
  - Customer service vs exploitation pattern identification in marketing
  - Employee development vs resource extraction analysis in HR communications
  - Financial responsibility vs manipulation detection in investor relations
  - Strategic purpose vs short-term focus analysis in mission statements
  
  ## Usage Guidelines
  
  ### Appropriate Applications
  - Corporate communication analysis for ethical orientation assessment
  - ESG reporting evaluation for stakeholder focus measurement
  - Business strategy analysis examining ethical framework consistency
  - Corporate governance assessment through communication patterns
  - Stakeholder capitalism implementation evaluation across domains
  
  ### Analysis Focus
  - Test stakeholder orientation through domain-specific clustering
  - Measure ethical consistency across three business responsibility areas
  - Detect contradiction patterns between stakeholder claims and practices
  - Evaluate corporate governance transparency through communication analysis

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert business ethics analyst specializing in stakeholder capitalism, 
    corporate governance, and sustainable business practices with deep knowledge of 
    ethical frameworks for evaluating business communications and corporate responsibility.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Evaluate how business communications demonstrate ethical orientation across three 
    domains: stakeholder relationships, operational integrity, and strategic vision. 
    Analyze whether communications prioritize stakeholder capitalism or shareholder 
    primacy across these distinct business responsibility areas.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for ethical positioning patterns within each domain cluster - stakeholder 
    relations (customer/employee treatment), operational integrity (governance/financial 
    practices), and strategic vision (long-term purpose). Note clustering patterns 
    within each domain and overall stakeholder vs shareholder orientation.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Score each axis pole on 0.0-1.0 scale based on presence/strength of ethical 
    orientation in the text, with specific textual evidence. Consider domain-specific 
    clustering and how different business ethics concerns manifest in distinct areas 
    of corporate communication.

  theoretical_approach: |
    Stakeholder-based ethical analysis focusing on three domains of business 
    responsibility clustered around specific arcs of analytical space. Each domain 
    represents distinct ethical concerns that businesses must navigate in their 
    communications and operations. Framework tests Freeman's stakeholder theory 
    implementation across corporate communication patterns.
