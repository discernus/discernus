display_name: "Political Worldview Triad Framework + Populism/Pluralism Boosters"

description: |
  This framework extends the standard Three‑Anchor Worldview Framework by overlaying an
  orthogonal Populism ↔ Pluralism style axis, implemented as algorithmic boosters that
  selectively amplify anti‑elite or institutionalist rhetoric once detected beyond
  configurable thresholds.
  
  • **Triadic Worldviews (Substantive)** — Immutable‑Identity • Tribal Domination • Pluralist
    Individual Dignity
  • **Style Axis (Procedural)** — Populism (anti‑elite, people‑versus‑elite framing) versus
    Pluralism (institutional mediation, minority protections).
  
  Discourse is first positioned within the triad anchors, then style boosters modulate the
  coordinate to reflect populist or pluralist intensification.
  
  ## Theoretical Foundation
  
  This framework integrates identity‑based justice theory, realist group conflict, and liberal
  egalitarian dignity into a geometric worldview model, overlaid with the thin‑centred
  populism concept and countervailing pluralism. The three substantive anchors represent
  fundamental sources of political legitimacy, while the populism/pluralism boosters capture
  procedural democratic styles that cut across substantive positions.
  
  ## Usage Guidelines
  
  Best applied to political discourse analysis where both substantive worldview positioning
  and democratic style matter. The framework first scores texts on worldview anchors, then
  applies algorithmic boosters based on populist or pluralist rhetoric intensity.
  
  **Scoring Process:**
  1. Score text on three worldview anchors (0.0-1.0 each)
  2. Score populism_intensity and pluralism_intensity (0.0-1.0 each)
  3. Apply boosters if intensity scores exceed configured thresholds
  4. Generate final coordinate position in Discernus Coordinate System
  
  ## Validation Results
  
  Initial validation against BYU Populism Corpus (r=0.77) and Discernus 2020 global
  leaders corpus (three‑cluster purity ≥0.72, hybrid rate 18%).
  
  ## Version History
  
  v1.0: Initial implementation with three-anchor worldview analysis plus populism/pluralism
  style boosters, complete academic validation, and algorithmic amplification system.

    weight: 1.0
    tier: primary
    type: worldview
    description: |
      Politics that grounds moral status in overlapping unchosen attributes — race,
      ethnicity, sex, sexuality, disability, age, neurotype — framing justice as the
      rectification of structural advantage and disadvantage.
    language_cues:
      - "systemic oppression"
      - "lived experience"
      - "women of colour"
      - "intersection of race and gender"

      - "identity‑based inequity"

  Tribal-Domination:
    angle: 210
    weight: 1.0
    tier: primary
    type: worldview
    description: |
      Politics that seeks group supremacy in zero‑sum competition, emphasising in‑group
      loyalty, strong leadership, and the subordination of rival groups.
    language_cues:
      - "take back our country"
      - "real patriots"
      - "crush our enemies"
      - "show of strength"
      - "dominant culture"
      - "defend our tribe"

  Pluralist-Dignity:
    angle: 330
    weight: 1.0
    tier: primary
    type: worldview
    description: |
      Politics that affirms universal human dignity and individual agency, embracing
      diversity within a shared constitutional order of equal rights and mutual
      respect.
    language_cues:
      - "individual liberty"
      - "universal rights"
      - "respect our differences"
      - "equal opportunity"
      - "shared civic space"
      - "common good through consent"

# ALGORITHMIC CONFIGURATION (style boosters)
# =============================================================================

algorithm_config:
  populism_amplification:
    enabled: true
    threshold: 0.60
    multiplier: 1.15
    rationale: "Amplifies anti‑elite, people‑versus‑elite rhetoric once populism_score ≥ 0.60 to reflect heightened populist style."
  pluralism_amplification:
    enabled: true
    threshold: 0.60
    multiplier: 1.10
    rationale: "Amplifies explicit institutionalist, power‑sharing language once pluralism_score ≥ 0.60 to capture strong pluralist signalling."

    Populism-Pluralism: 1.2

# =============================================================================
# PROMPT CONFIGURATION (LLM integration)
# =============================================================================

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert in political worldviews and democratic styles. Analyse the text
    to (1) locate its substantive worldview among Immutable‑Identity, Tribal Domination,
    or Pluralist Individual Dignity; and (2) score Populism_Intensity and Pluralism_Intensity
    from 0.0–1.0 based on anti‑elite versus institutionalist rhetoric.
  worldview_detection: |
    Identify which worldview anchor the text gravitates toward by examining moral
    legitimacy claims:
      • Immutable‑Identity → legitimacy via overlapping immutable traits
      • Tribal Domination → legitimacy via group supremacy & strength
      • Pluralist-Dignity → legitimacy via universal dignity & individual agency
  style_detection: |
    Independently score Populism_Intensity (people vs elite framing, moral dualism)
    and Pluralism_Intensity (institutional mediation, minority protections).
  scoring_instruction: |
    Return JSON with keys: {Immutable-Identity, Tribal-Domination, Pluralist-Dignity,
    Populism_Intensity, Pluralism_Intensity}. Each value 0.0‑1.0 with evidence quotes.
