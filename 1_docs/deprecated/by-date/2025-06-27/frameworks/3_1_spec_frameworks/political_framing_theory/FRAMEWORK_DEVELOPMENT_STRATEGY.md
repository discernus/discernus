# Political Framing Theory Framework Development Strategy

**Date:** June 17, 2025  
**Status:** Strategic Planning Phase  
**Theoretical Foundation:** Entman & Lakoff Political Framing Theory Integration  

## Strategic Overview

Based on comprehensive research into Political Framing Theory foundations and integration studies, this document outlines the development of **two complementary frameworks** that operationalize different aspects of political framing for computational analysis.

## Framework Architecture Strategy

### **Architectural Alternatives Considered and Design Rationale**

#### **Alternative 1: Single Dipole Framework**
**Structure:** One dipole axis (Strict Father Model ↔ Nurturant Parent Model)
**Approach:** Aggregate scoring across all family model components

*Advantages:*
- Simpler implementation and analysis
- Direct operationalization of Lakoff's primary theoretical distinction
- Clear interpretability with single positioning score

*Disadvantages:*
- **Loss of granular insight**: Cannot identify which specific components drive family model positioning
- **Untestable coherence assumption**: Assumes family model coherence without empirical validation
- **Limited research questions**: Cannot detect partial activation or mixed messaging patterns
- **Reduced analytical sophistication**: Misses opportunity to test core theoretical predictions

*Decision Rationale for Rejection:* While theoretically faithful to Lakoff's primary distinction, this approach treats family model coherence as an assumption rather than a testable hypothesis, limiting both analytical depth and research contribution.

#### **Alternative 2: Six Independent Wells (No Clustering Hypothesis)**
**Structure:** Six separate wells without theoretical clustering predictions
**Approach:** Treat Authority/Discipline, Competition/Hierarchy, Self-Reliance, Empathy/Communication, Cooperation/Mutual Support, and Interdependence as independent dimensions

*Advantages:*
- Maximum analytical flexibility and granular detail
- No theoretical assumptions about component relationships
- Can detect any pattern of activation across dimensions

*Disadvantages:*
- **Abandons core theoretical insight**: Ignores Lakoff's fundamental claim about family model coherence
- **Lacks predictive framework**: No theoretical basis for expecting specific patterns
- **Reduces theoretical contribution**: Becomes purely exploratory rather than theory-testing
- **Misses novel research opportunity**: Cannot validate or refute cognitive linguistics predictions

*Decision Rationale for Rejection:* While methodologically flexible, this approach fails to engage with Lakoff's core theoretical contribution about worldview coherence, reducing the framework's theoretical significance and research impact.

#### **Alternative 3: Hybrid Framework (Three Dipoles + Meta-Dipole)**
**Structure:** Three component dipoles PLUS an overarching Strict Father ↔ Nurturant Parent meta-dipole
**Approach:** Score individual components and aggregate family model positioning

*Advantages:*
- Maintains both granular and aggregate analysis capabilities
- Preserves direct operationalization of Lakoff's primary distinction
- Enables multiple levels of theoretical testing

*Disadvantages:*
- **Analytical redundancy**: Meta-dipole likely correlates highly with clustering analysis
- **Increased complexity**: Additional scoring dimension without proportional insight gain
- **Theoretical confusion**: Unclear whether meta-dipole or clustering analysis takes precedence
- **Implementation burden**: More complex prompt templates and scoring procedures

*Decision Rationale for Rejection:* The arc clustering analysis provides the same theoretical insights as a meta-dipole while offering superior geometric validation and coherence testing capabilities.

#### **Selected Approach: Three Dipoles with Arc Clustering Hypothesis**

*Strategic Advantages of Chosen Architecture:*

**1. Optimal Theoretical Testing**
- **Tests rather than assumes** family model coherence through geometric clustering
- **Preserves granular analysis** while maintaining theoretical predictions
- **Enables discovery of coherence violations** and mixed messaging patterns
- **Provides quantitative validation** of cognitive linguistics theory

**2. Methodological Innovation** 
- **Novel application of circular geometry** to validate theoretical predictions
- **Sophisticated clustering analysis** using center of mass and separation metrics
- **Empirical testing of worldview coherence** through computational analysis
- **Geometric validation methodology** transferable to other theoretical frameworks

**3. Analytical Sophistication**
- **Multi-level analysis capability**: Component-level, cluster-level, and overall positioning
- **Rich research question portfolio**: 10+ distinct empirical questions enabled
- **Coherence violation detection**: Identifies texts that violate theoretical predictions
- **Strategic messaging analysis**: Detects deliberate cross-cluster activation patterns

**4. Academic Contribution Maximization**
- **First quantitative test** of Lakoff's family model clustering predictions
- **Methodological bridge** between cognitive linguistics and computational analysis
- **Theory validation framework** applicable beyond political framing theory
- **Novel geometric approach** to testing theoretical coherence hypotheses

**5. Practical Research Value**
- **Maintains theoretical grounding** while enabling discovery of unexpected patterns
- **Provides validation metrics** for family model theory through clustering success rates
- **Enables predictive testing** of worldview consistency across issues and time
- **Offers diagnostic capability** for detecting mixed or incoherent political messaging

### **Framework 1: Lakoff Family Models Framework (Three Dipoles with Arc Clustering)**
**Type:** Multi-Dipole Architecture with Theoretical Arc Clustering  
**Theoretical Foundation:** Lakoff's "Moral Politics" family-based moral systems  
**Core Insight:** Political worldviews stem from coherent family models - this framework tests that coherence hypothesis empirically through circular geometry  

#### **Three-Dipole Structure with Arc Clustering**
```yaml
Architecture: Three Independent Dipoles (Six Wells) with Predicted Arc Clustering

Dipole 1: Authority/Discipline ↔ Empathy/Communication
  Authority/Discipline Well:
    - Strong moral authority and clear discipline
    - Hierarchical decision-making and order
    - Leadership through strength and control
    - "firm boundaries," "chain of command," "respect for authority"
  
  Empathy/Communication Well:
    - Empathetic understanding and inclusive dialogue
    - Communication-based problem solving
    - Listening to diverse perspectives and voices
    - "understand different perspectives," "open communication," "bridge differences"

Dipole 2: Competition/Hierarchy ↔ Cooperation/Mutual Support
  Competition/Hierarchy Well:
    - Natural hierarchy and merit-based competition
    - Winners and losers as character building
    - Individual achievement through competitive advantage
    - "merit-based selection," "survival of the fittest," "earned position"
  
  Cooperation/Mutual Support Well:
    - Egalitarian cooperation and shared responsibility
    - Collective problem-solving and mutual aid
    - Protection of vulnerable and community care
    - "working together," "mutual support," "collective effort"

Dipole 3: Self-Reliance ↔ Interdependence
  Self-Reliance Well:
    - Individual responsibility and self-determination
    - Personal accountability for outcomes
    - Strength through independence and self-sufficiency
    - "personal responsibility," "pull yourself up," "stand on your own"
  
  Interdependence Well:
    - Collective responsibility and social connection
    - Strength through unity and shared purpose
    - Mutual dependence as foundation for society
    - "we're all connected," "stronger together," "mutual dependence"

Theoretical Arc Clustering Hypothesis:
  Strict Father Wells: Authority/Discipline + Competition/Hierarchy + Self-Reliance
    → Predicted to cluster on LEFT arc segment (e.g., 270° to 90°)
  
  Nurturant Parent Wells: Empathy/Communication + Cooperation/Mutual Support + Interdependence  
    → Predicted to cluster on RIGHT arc segment (e.g., 90° to 270°)

Specific Arc Positioning Strategy:
  Strict Father Arc Cluster (270° to 90° - Left Side):
    - Authority/Discipline Well: 315° (Northwest quadrant)
    - Competition/Hierarchy Well: 0° (North - top of circle)  
    - Self-Reliance Well: 45° (Northeast quadrant)
    
  Nurturant Parent Arc Cluster (90° to 270° - Right Side):
    - Empathy/Communication Well: 135° (Southeast quadrant)
    - Cooperation/Mutual Support Well: 180° (South - bottom of circle)
    - Interdependence Well: 225° (Southwest quadrant)

Arc Separation Analysis:
  - 180° separation between arc cluster centers (Strict Father center ≈ 0°, Nurturant Parent center ≈ 180°)
  - Minimum 90° gap between nearest wells from different family models
  - Maximum intra-cluster separation: 90° within each family model  
  - Clustering coefficient calculation: measure actual vs. predicted positioning

Visual Framework Layout:
```
    Competition/Hierarchy (0°)
           |
Self-Reliance (45°) ----+---- Authority/Discipline (315°)
           |                      |
           |                      |
           |        CENTER        |
           |                      |
           |                      |
Empathy/Communication (135°) ----+---- Interdependence (225°)
           |
    Cooperation/Mutual Support (180°)

Strict Father Arc: 315° → 0° → 45° (Left cluster)
Nurturant Parent Arc: 135° → 180° → 225° (Right cluster)
```

Research Questions This Architecture Enables:
  1. **Family Model Coherence Testing**: Do political texts that score high on Authority/Discipline also score high on Competition/Hierarchy and Self-Reliance as Lakoff predicts?
  
  2. **Arc Clustering Validation**: Do the six wells actually cluster geographically as predicted by family model theory when analyzing real political communications?
  
  3. **Coherence Violation Detection**: What percentage of political texts violate family model predictions by mixing Strict Father and Nurturant Parent language patterns?
  
  4. **Component Dominance Analysis**: Which specific family model components (Authority, Competition, Self-Reliance vs. Empathy, Cooperation, Interdependence) are most/least present across different political contexts?
  
  5. **Cross-Issue Worldview Consistency**: Do political figures maintain consistent family model clustering patterns across different policy domains (economic, social, foreign policy)?
  
  6. **Strategic Messaging Analysis**: Can we detect when political communications deliberately mix family model elements for strategic purposes (e.g., "compassionate conservatism")?
  
  7. **Family Model Strength Measurement**: How "purely" do political texts represent each family model? What is the quantitative separation between clusters?
  
  8. **Predictive Worldview Analysis**: Can family model positioning on known issues predict positions on new/emerging political issues?
  
  9. **Temporal Consistency Analysis**: Do political figures maintain consistent arc clustering patterns over time, or do they shift between family models?
  
  10. **Audience-Dependent Framing**: Do political figures adjust their family model emphasis based on intended audience while maintaining overall worldview coherence?
```

- **Intra-Cluster Coherence**: Average distance between wells within same family model
- **Inter-Cluster Distance**: Minimum distance between wells from different family models

*Coherence Violation Detection:*
- **Mixed Messaging Score**: Texts scoring high on both family model clusters simultaneously  
- **Contradiction Index**: Wells from opposing family models both highly activated
- **Family Model Purity**: Percentage of total activation concentrated in predicted cluster
- **Strategic Mixing Detection**: Systematic patterns of cross-cluster activation

*Validation Metrics:*

- **Cross-Issue Coherence**: Ability to predict positions across seemingly unrelated policy areas

### **Framework 2: Entman Framing Functions Framework (Independent Wells)**

#### **Architectural Alternatives Considered for Entman Framework**

#### **Alternative 1: Four Dipoles Framework**
**Structure:** Convert Entman's four functions into dipole pairs
**Approach:** Problem Definition ↔ Solution Focus, Causal Attribution ↔ Actor Absolution, Moral Evaluation ↔ Pragmatic Assessment, Treatment Recommendation ↔ Status Quo Maintenance

*Advantages:*
- Maintains dipole consistency with Lakoff framework architecture
- Could enable geometric clustering analysis similar to family model approach
- Provides clear oppositional structure for each function

*Disadvantages:*
- **Violates Entman's theoretical framework**: His four functions are not oppositional pairs but distinct analytical dimensions
- **Creates artificial oppositions**: Forces theoretical constructs that don't exist in Entman's communication theory
- **Loses analytical precision**: Entman's functions operate independently, not as competing alternatives
- **Misrepresents framing theory**: Frames can simultaneously define problems AND recommend treatments without contradiction

*Decision Rationale for Rejection:* Entman's theoretical insight is that framing functions operate as independent analytical dimensions, not oppositional pairs. Creating artificial dipoles would misrepresent the communication theory foundation.

#### **Alternative 2: Integrated Clustering with Lakoff Framework**
**Structure:** Combine Entman's four functions with Lakoff's family model components in single framework
**Approach:** Ten-dimensional framework testing whether framing functions cluster with family model components

*Advantages:*
- Tests integration hypothesis directly through single framework
- Could reveal systematic relationships between cognitive models and communication strategies
- Maximizes analytical comprehensiveness in single analysis

*Disadvantages:*
- **Theoretical confusion**: Conflates "frames in thought" (Lakoff) with "frames in communication" (Entman)
- **Overwhelming complexity**: Ten-dimensional analysis difficult to interpret and validate
- **Different analytical levels**: Family models operate at worldview level, framing functions at message level
- **Reduces theoretical clarity**: Obscures distinct contributions of each theoretical tradition

*Decision Rationale for Rejection:* Chong & Druckman's integration research shows these address different but complementary aspects of framing. Combining them obscures rather than clarifies their distinct theoretical contributions.

#### **Alternative 3: Hierarchical Framework**
**Structure:** Entman functions as subcategories within Lakoff family model clusters
**Approach:** Family model positioning determines which framing functions are emphasized

*Advantages:*
- Maintains theoretical hierarchy suggested by some integration literature
- Could test whether family models predict framing function usage patterns
- Preserves both theoretical frameworks while suggesting causal relationships

*Disadvantages:*
- **Unproven theoretical assumption**: No empirical evidence that family models determine framing function selection
- **Reduces Entman framework autonomy**: Treats communication functions as dependent on cognitive models
- **Limits independent validation**: Cannot test framing function effectiveness independent of family model context
- **Constrains research questions**: Assumes rather than tests relationship between theoretical frameworks

*Decision Rationale for Rejection:* This approach assumes a hierarchical relationship between cognitive models and communication functions that lacks empirical support and constrains theoretical testing.

#### **Selected Approach: Independent Wells Framework**

**Architecture Description:**

**Structure:** Four independent wells positioned equally around the circle (90° separation)
**Well Positioning:**
- **Problem Definition Well**: 0° (North - top of circle)
- **Causal Attribution Well**: 90° (East - right side)  
- **Moral Evaluation Well**: 180° (South - bottom of circle)
- **Treatment Recommendation Well**: 270° (West - left side)

**Scoring Approach:** Each well is scored independently on 0.0-1.0 scale based on presence/strength of that specific framing function in the text (consistent with existing framework conventions). Unlike dipole frameworks, there are no oppositional relationships - a text can score high on all four functions simultaneously.

**Theoretical Implementation:**
- **Problem Definition** scoring detects language that identifies, defines, or bounds issues requiring attention
- **Causal Attribution** scoring detects language assigning responsibility, blame, or explaining causation
- **Moral Evaluation** scoring detects value judgments, ethical assessments, or moral framework invocations
- **Treatment Recommendation** scoring detects solution advocacy, policy proposals, or action recommendations

**Analytical Outputs:**
- **Function Profile**: Four-dimensional score showing which framing functions are present/absent
- **Message Completeness**: Percentage of Entman's functions utilized in the communication
- **Function Balance**: Distribution of emphasis across the four framing dimensions
- **Strategic Sophistication**: Overall use of systematic framing across all four functions

**Key Differences from Rejected Alternatives:**
- **vs. Dipoles**: No forced oppositions - functions can co-occur without contradiction
- **vs. Integration**: Maintains distinct communication-level analysis separate from cognitive worldview
- **vs. Hierarchy**: Treats all four functions as equally important independent dimensions

*Strategic Advantages of Chosen Architecture:*

**1. Theoretical Fidelity**
- **Preserves Entman's core insight**: Framing functions operate as independent analytical dimensions
- **Maintains communication theory integrity**: Respects the systematic communication analysis foundation

- **Allows comprehensive framing analysis**: All four functions can be present simultaneously without contradiction

**2. Complementary Analysis with Lakoff Framework**
- **Addresses different analytical levels**: Communication strategy vs. cognitive worldview
- **Enables comparative insights**: What does each framework reveal that the other misses?
- **Tests Chong & Druckman integration**: Validates that frameworks address "frames in communication" vs. "frames in thought"
- **Preserves distinct theoretical contributions**: Each framework maintains its analytical integrity

**3. Research Question Portfolio**
- **Frame competition detection**: Identifies conflicting problem definitions or treatment recommendations
- **Strategic communication analysis**: Measures sophistication of message construction across functions
- **Function coherence assessment**: Tests internal consistency across the four framing dimensions
- **Message completeness evaluation**: Identifies which framing functions are present or absent

**4. Methodological Contribution**
- **Systematic operationalization** of communication theory's core framing construct
- **Independent validation** of framing function theory through computational analysis
- **Framework comparison methodology** enabling theory testing across different analytical approaches
- **Communication strategy assessment** tools for political discourse analysis

**5. Academic Positioning**
- **Respects theoretical foundations** of both Entman and Lakoff traditions
- **Enables integration testing** while preserving distinct theoretical insights
- **Provides comprehensive framing analysis** through complementary theoretical approaches
- **Advances computational communication research** through systematic function operationalization

**Type:** Independent Wells Architecture  
**Theoretical Foundation:** Entman's systematic communication analysis  
**Core Insight:** Political frames operate through four distinct functions that can vary independently  

#### **Independent Wells Structure**

- **Moral Judgment**: "This is fundamentally wrong", "Ethically unacceptable", "Morally justified"
- **Moral Framework**: "Our principles dictate...", "Core values include...", "What we stand for..."

**Treatment Recommendation Signals:**
