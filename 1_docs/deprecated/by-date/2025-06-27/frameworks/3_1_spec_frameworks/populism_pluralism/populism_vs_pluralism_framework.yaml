  Populism vs Pluralism - A specialized Discernus Coordinates framework analyzing 
  the tension between populist and pluralist approaches to democratic governance. 
  This framework examines how discourse either promotes singular "will of the people" 
  narratives or embraces democratic pluralism and institutional mediation.

      description: |
        Emphasizes direct expression of popular will, dismisses institutional

  theoretical_approach: |
    This framework examines democratic discourse through the lens of populist versus 
    pluralist approaches to legitimate authority. It analyzes how language either 
    reinforces populist claims to direct popular sovereignty or supports pluralist 
    democratic institutions and norms.

# PROMPT CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert analyst of democratic theory and political systems, with deep 
    knowledge of populist and pluralist approaches to democratic governance. You 
    specialize in analyzing how discourse supports different visions of legitimate 
    democratic authority.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Evaluate how the text either supports pluralist democratic institutions and norms 
    OR embraces populist direct democracy and majoritarian sovereignty. Focus specifically 
    on attitudes toward institutional mediation, minority rights, and the source of 
    legitimate political authority.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for patterns of democratic reasoning that either affirm institutional democracy 
    with constitutional protections or prioritize direct popular will over institutional 
    constraints. Analyze both explicit democratic theory and implicit assumptions about 
    legitimate governance.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Score coordinates based on textual evidence of democratic orientation, using 0.0-1.0 
    scale with specific quotations supporting each assessment. Focus on democratic theory 
    frameworks rather than specific policy positions.
