  The Populism vs Pluralism Framework analyzes the fundamental tension between populist and 
  pluralist approaches to democratic governance. This framework examines how political discourse 
  either promotes singular "will of the people" narratives or embraces democratic pluralism 
  and institutional mediation, representing competing visions of legitimate democratic authority.
  
  ## Theoretical Foundation
  
  This framework operationalizes the ideological contrast between populism and pluralism as 
  grounded in the ideational theory of populism developed by political scientists studying 
  democratic governance and institutional legitimacy. It captures rhetorical worldviews that 
  fundamentally differ in their conception of democratic authority and institutional role.
  
  ### Core Theoretical Distinction
  
  **Populism as Thin-Centered Ideology** - Views politics as a moral struggle between "the pure 
  people" and "the corrupt elite," emphasizing:
  - Direct expression of popular will without institutional mediation
  - Majoritarian democracy prioritized over constitutional limits
  - Anti-institutional sentiment and elite dismissal
  - Moral dualism between people and establishment
  
  **Pluralism as Democratic Institutionalism** - Accepts institutional mediation, legitimate 
  opposition, and political pluralism, emphasizing:
  - Constitutional protections and minority rights
  - Institutional mediation and checks and balances
  - Procedural democracy and democratic norms
  - Multiple legitimate voices in governance
  
  ## Methodological Innovation
  
  ### Ideational Worldview Analysis
  This framework tests competing democratic visions through discourse analysis:
  - **Popular Sovereignty**: Direct democracy vs institutional democracy
  - **Elite Legitimacy**: Anti-establishment vs institutional legitimacy
  - **Authority Source**: People's will vs constitutional process
  - **Democratic Process**: Majoritarian vs procedural emphasis
  
  ### Contradiction Detection
  The framework identifies texts containing both populist and pluralist elements, 
  detecting strategic worldview mixing or ideological inconsistency within 
  communications.
  
  ## Research Applications
  
  ### Democratic Theory Analysis
  - Longitudinal analysis of populist drift across campaigns or political actors
  - Diagnostic testing of rhetorical worldview coherence in political communications
  - Integration with broader democratic backsliding and institutional legitimacy research
  - Cross-national comparison of populist vs pluralist democratic rhetoric
  
  ### Political Communication Research
  - Campaign message consistency analysis across democratic theory dimensions
  - Strategic worldview positioning assessment in political communications
  - Media framing analysis of democratic legitimacy and institutional authority
  - Policy argument evaluation through democratic governance lens
  
  ## Usage Guidelines
  
  ### Appropriate Applications
  - Political speech analysis for democratic theory positioning
  - Campaign communication assessment for populist vs pluralist orientation
  - Policy argument analysis examining democratic legitimacy frameworks
  - Democratic discourse quality evaluation through institutional lens
  - Strategic messaging assessment for democratic worldview consistency
  
  ### Analysis Focus
  - Test worldview coherence through populist vs pluralist positioning
  - Measure democratic theory consistency across issue domains
  - Detect contradiction patterns indicating strategic messaging
  - Evaluate institutional legitimacy framing in political discourse

prompt_configuration:
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert analyst of democratic theory and political systems, with deep 
    knowledge of populist and pluralist approaches to democratic governance. You 
    specialize in analyzing how discourse supports different visions of legitimate 
    democratic authority and the role of institutions in democratic societies.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Evaluate how the text either supports pluralist democratic institutions and norms 
    OR embraces populist direct democracy and majoritarian sovereignty. Focus specifically 
    on attitudes toward institutional mediation, minority rights, elite legitimacy, 
    and the source of legitimate political authority.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for patterns of democratic reasoning that either affirm institutional democracy 
    with constitutional protections or prioritize direct popular will over institutional 
    constraints. Analyze both explicit democratic theory positioning and implicit 
    assumptions about legitimate governance, elite roles, and democratic processes.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Score coordinates based on textual evidence of democratic orientation, using 0.0-1.0 
    scale with specific quotations supporting each assessment. Focus on democratic theory 
    frameworks rather than specific policy positions. Detect contradictions where both 
    populist and pluralist elements appear simultaneously.

  theoretical_approach: |
    This framework examines democratic discourse through the lens of populist versus 
    pluralist approaches to legitimate authority. It analyzes how language either 
    reinforces populist claims to direct popular sovereignty or supports pluralist 
    democratic institutions and norms. Based on ideational theory of populism that 
    views it as thin-centered ideology emphasizing moral struggle between pure people 
    and corrupt elite.
  
  academic_validation: |
    Framework validated through democratic theory research and comparative politics 
    studies. Implements ideational model of populism developed by leading scholars 
    of democratic governance and institutional legitimacy. Provides systematic 
    analysis methodology for competing visions of democratic authority.
