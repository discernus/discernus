# MFT Framework: Critical Repairs Post-Expert Review

**Response to Expert Review**  
**Date:** June 19, 2025  
**Status:** Critical Vulnerability Repair  
**Assessment:** "Sophisticated but academically exposed" - requires systematic repair  

## Expert Review Summary

The reviewer acknowledged our improvements over computational framework standards but identified **8 fatal weaknesses** that would lead to peer review destruction. Their assessment: framework has "modern safeguards but is still scaffolded by unvalidated weights, missing foundations, and implementation gaps."

## Systematic Repair Plan

### **Fatal Weakness 1: Equal Weighting Still Untested Assumption**

**Reviewer Critique**: "Any published results with placeholder weights are, by definition, provisional and could invert when real weights arrive. Critics will dismiss findings as premature."

**Immediate Repair**:
- **Action**: Suspend any results publication until empirical weights derived
- **Emergency Protocol**: Factor analysis of existing MFQ-30 dataset (n=1000+ if available) 
- **Alternative**: Partner with research group with existing MFQ data for weight derivation
- **Timeline**: Complete weight derivation before any framework deployment

**Implementation Strategy**:
```yaml
weighting_status: "CRITICAL - No results publishable until empirical weights derived"
current_approach: "Framework development only - no analysis until weights validated"
emergency_protocol: "Collaborate with existing MFQ dataset holders for immediate weight derivation"
```

### **Fatal Weakness 2: Survey-Text Conflation**

**Reviewer Critique**: "Empirical work shows only moderate correlations (r ≈ 0.3–0.5) between linguistic and self-report morality. Your success criterion of r > 0.6 overall may be unreachable."

**Critical Adjustment**:
- **Realistic Targets**: Lower correlation expectations to r > 0.4 overall, foundation-specific r > 0.35
- **Multiple Validation**: Don't rely solely on MFQ correlation
- **Behavioral Validation**: Include known-groups validation (texts from groups with established moral differences)
- **Construct Validity**: Explicitly acknowledge survey-text as related but distinct constructs

**Revised Success Criteria**:
```yaml
construct_validity:
  mfq_correlation: "r > 0.4 overall (realistic based on literature)"
  foundation_specific: "Care r > 0.45, Fairness r > 0.40, others r > 0.35"
  known_groups: "Effect sizes d > 0.5 for expected group differences"
  behavioral_prediction: "Correlation with actual moral behaviors r > 0.3"
```

### **Fatal Weakness 3: Coordinate System Theatrics**

**Reviewer Critique**: "Angles never enter any statistical model. Reviewers will call this decorative and demand justification beyond aesthetics."

**Systematic Repair**:
- **Remove Aesthetic Claims**: Eliminate references to coordinate system as analytically meaningful
- **Statistical Focus**: Emphasize that analysis uses foundation scores, not positions
- **Visualization Only**: Frame circular display as visualization convenience, not theoretical structure
- **PCA Alternative**: Prepare PCA-based visualization as statistically meaningful alternative

**Updated Framework Description**:
```yaml
coordinate_system:
  purpose: "Visualization convenience only - no analytical significance"
  analysis_method: "Foundation scores used directly in statistical models"
  alternative_viz: "PCA space representation available for statistical meaningfulness"
```

### **Fatal Weakness 4: Liberty/Oppression Omission**

**Reviewer Critique**: "The literature now treats Liberty as a sixth foundation for libertarian and populist rhetoric. Expect claims of theoretical incompleteness."

**Framework Expansion**:
- **Add Liberty/Oppression**: Implement as 6th foundation immediately
- **Literature Review**: Update theory summary with Liberty foundation research
- **Validation Protocol**: Include Liberty in all validation studies
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain 5-foundation option for comparison with existing literature

**Implementation Timeline**:
```yaml
liberty_foundation:
  status: "CRITICAL ADDITION - required for theoretical completeness"
  implementation: "Week 1 - immediate addition to framework"
  validation: "Include in all reliability and correlation studies"
  literature_support: "Iyer et al. (2012), Haidt (2012) libertarian analysis"
```

### **Fatal Weakness 5: Over-Promised Reliability Thresholds**

**Reviewer Critique**: "κ ≥ 0.75 human–LLM and r ≥ 0.90 cross-LLM consistency are aspirational. Published moral-language classifiers rarely clear κ = 0.60."

**Realistic Threshold Adjustment**:
- **Initial Targets**: κ ≥ 0.65 human-LLM, κ ≥ 0.70 inter-human, r ≥ 0.80 cross-LLM
- **Escalation Protocol**: Raise thresholds only after initial targets consistently met
- **Literature Benchmarking**: Cite published reliability ranges for moral-language classification
- **Transparent Reporting**: Report actual achieved reliability regardless of targets

**Revised Reliability Standards**:
```yaml
reliability_targets:
  phase_1_minimum: "κ ≥ 0.65 human-LLM (literature-realistic)"
  phase_1_goal: "κ ≥ 0.70 human-LLM" 
  escalation_criteria: "Consistent achievement of phase 1 before raising targets"
  transparency: "Report all achieved reliability with confidence intervals"
```

### **Fatal Weakness 6: Cross-Cultural Claims Are Marketing Copy**

**Reviewer Critique**: "Cue lists remain English-centric. Without parallel lexicons, cross-cultural claims are marketing copy."

**Scope Limitation**:
- **Immediate**: Remove all cross-cultural claims from framework documentation
- **Honest Scope**: Explicitly limit to "English-language political discourse"
- **Future Research**: Frame cross-cultural work as separate research agenda
- **Collaboration**: Partner with cross-cultural researchers for eventual expansion

**Updated Scope Documentation**:
```yaml
scope_limitation:
  current_validity: "English-language political discourse only"
  cultural_scope: "Primarily US/UK political contexts"
  future_research: "Cross-cultural expansion requires separate validation studies"
  honest_marketing: "No unsupported cross-cultural claims"
```

### **Fatal Weakness 7: Metaphor Detection Lacking Algorithms**

**Reviewer Critique**: "The YAML lists what you want detected but provides no extraction method. Absent a concrete parsing pipeline, reviewers will label this section speculative."

**Implementation Requirements**:
- **Concrete Algorithms**: Provide actual implementation for each detection layer
- **Testing Protocol**: Validate each detection method against expert coding
- **Incremental Approach**: Start with basic detection, add complexity systematically
- **Documentation**: Complete technical documentation for all detection methods

**Technical Implementation Plan**:
```yaml
detection_implementation:
  syntactic: "Dependency parsing with moral imperative pattern matching"
  semantic: "Named entity recognition for agent-patient moral relationships"
  metaphor: "Pattern matching against validated metaphor databases"
  narrative: "Narrative role classification using supervised learning"
  validation_each: "Expert-coded comparison for each detection layer"
```

### **Fatal Weakness 8: Model-Side Bias Auditing Missing**

**Reviewer Critique**: "Bias can enter through training data and decoding priors, not just prompts. No procedure for model-side bias auditing."

**Comprehensive Bias Auditing**:
- **Counter-Balanced Testing**: Test with texts designed to reveal political bias
- **Baseline Comparison**: Compare results with human expert baseline
- **Systematic Bias Quantification**: Measure and report bias metrics
- **Multiple Model Validation**: Test bias consistency across different LLMs

**Bias Auditing Protocol**:
```yaml
bias_auditing:
  counter_balanced_stimuli: "Liberal/conservative text pairs with matched content"
  political_bias_detection: "Systematic measurement of foundation assignment bias"
  expert_baseline: "Compare LLM bias patterns with human expert bias patterns"
  transparency: "Report all bias metrics alongside reliability metrics"
```

## Conclusion

This repair process transforms the expert review from criticism into invaluable guidance for achieving genuine academic rigor. By systematically addressing each vulnerability, we demonstrate that computational frameworks can move beyond "dictionary + frequency" approaches to meet the standards of hostile academic review.

The repaired framework will serve as proof-of-concept that AI-assisted social science can achieve genuine methodological sophistication when guided by domain experts and subjected to rigorous scrutiny.

**Next Action**: Begin Week 1 critical repairs with Liberty foundation addition and emergency weight derivation protocol.
