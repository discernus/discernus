description: |
  Enhanced Moral Foundations Theory framework implementing Jonathan Haidt's research 
  with systematic methodological improvements for academic rigor and configurable 
  algorithm support. Uses the new axes-based coordinate system for improved 
  clarity and extensibility with LLM-prompting-amplification pipeline integration.

  ## Theoretical Foundation
  
  This framework implements Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory, which identifies 
  innate psychological foundations that cultures build upon to create diverse moral systems. 
  The theory proposes that moral judgments are based on multiple foundations including 
  Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation, 
  and Liberty/Oppression. This implementation uses an axes-based coordinate system for 
  improved semantic clarity and mathematical rigor.
  
  ## Usage Guidelines
  
  This framework is designed for analyzing moral discourse in political texts, opinion 
  pieces, and policy discussions. It identifies moral foundations present in text and 
  provides quantitative scores for each foundation. Best used for:
  - Political discourse analysis
  - Moral psychology research
  - Cross-cultural value studies
  - Policy communication analysis

  theoretical_approach: |
    Based on Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory which identifies innate psychological 
    foundations that cultures build upon to create diverse moral systems. Updated
    to use axes-based coordinate system for improved semantic clarity and
    configurable algorithm support with proper foundation/violation pairings.

# PROMPT INTEGRATION
# =============================================================================

prompt_configuration:
  bias_mitigation_approach: "Enhanced prompts designed to prevent circular validation"
  
  expert_role: |
    You are an expert in moral psychology and value analysis with deep knowledge 
    of how moral reasoning manifests in discourse across cultures and political 
    orientations. You specialize in identifying implicit moral frameworks.
  
  bias_neutral_analysis_focus: |
    Analyze the values, principles, and moral reasoning present in this text. 
    Identify what moral concerns are emphasized, what behaviors are praised or 
    criticized, and what underlying value systems guide the reasoning.
  
  detection_approach: |
    Look for patterns of moral reasoning including: protection of vulnerable 
    individuals, concerns about fair treatment, group loyalty and solidarity, 
    respect for authority and tradition, and spiritual or purity concerns. 
    Also identify moral violations: harm, cheating, betrayal, subversion, degradation, oppression.
    Analyze both explicit statements and implicit moral assumptions.
  
  scoring_methodology: |
    Score moral dimensions based on textual evidence of value emphasis, using 
    0.0-1.0 scale with specific quotations supporting each assessment. Focus on 
    strength of moral concern rather than political affiliation predictions.
  
  enhanced_detection_instructions: |
    Beyond explicit moral vocabulary, identify: (1) Syntactic patterns like moral 
    imperatives and causal moral reasoning, (2) Metaphorical expressions of values, 
    (3) Narrative moral positioning and role assignments, (4) Agent-patient 
    structures revealing moral agency, (5) Collective identity construction patterns.
