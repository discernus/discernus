# Deprecation Notice: PlanExecutorAgent

**Date**: July 24, 2025
**Status**: Deprecated

## Reason for Deprecation

This agent was deprecated because it violated the THIN architectural principle of separating orchestration intelligence from execution. It combined plan parsing with an LLM call, making it an overly "THICK" and complex component.

## Replacement

This agent's functionality has been replaced by the new, thin **`Execution Bridge`**.

- **Location**: `scripts/execution_bridge.py`
- **Purpose**: The `ExecutionBridge` is a simple, non-intelligent Python script that deterministically parses a plan from the `OrchestratorAgent` and enqueues the specified tasks in Redis. It contains no LLM calls or complex decision-making logic.

This change enforces our core architectural principles and simplifies the orchestration pipeline.
