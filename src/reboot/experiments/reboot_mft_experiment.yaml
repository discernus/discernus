framework:
  name: moral_foundations_theory
  version: "1.1-reboot"
  description: |
    Based on Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory, which identifies innate psychological foundations 
    that cultures build upon to create diverse moral systems. This framework uses a detailed,
    axes-based coordinate system for improved semantic clarity and analysis.

prompt_guidance:
  role_definition: |
    You are an expert in moral psychology and value analysis with deep knowledge of how moral reasoning manifests in discourse. Your task is to analyze the provided text using the detailed Moral Foundations Theory framework defined below.

  framework_summary_instructions: |
    Your analysis will use the Moral Foundations Theory. You must score the text against the **six integrative anchors**: Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity, and Liberty. The full definition of the framework's axes and anchors is provided for your reference.

  analysis_methodology: |
    **CONCEPTUAL ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY:**
    This framework employs a conceptual assessment approach that prioritizes semantic understanding over surface-level keyword counting. You should:
    1. **Identify Underlying Values**: First, identify the underlying moral values being expressed in the narrative, regardless of the specific language used.
    2. **Assess Conceptual Strength**: Score based on how strongly each anchor shapes the narrative's fundamental structure and arguments, not just the frequency of related words. The provided language cues are illustrative examples, not an exhaustive list.

  scoring_requirements: |
    **CRITICAL SCORING REQUIREMENTS:**
    - Use ONLY decimal values between 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g., 0.3, 0.7, 0.9).
    - Provide a score for each of the six integrative anchors.

  json_format_instructions: |
    **JSON FORMAT:**
    Return a single JSON object. The keys should be the names of the 6 integrative anchors (Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity, Liberty).
    The value for each key should be an object containing a "score" (float 0.0-1.0), "evidence" (a direct quote from the text that best represents the foundation), and "reasoning" (a brief justification for your score).
    
    Example for one anchor:
    "Care": { "score": 0.8, "evidence": "...", "reasoning": "..." }
