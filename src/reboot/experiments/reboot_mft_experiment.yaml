  scoring_requirements: |
    **SCORING REQUIREMENTS:**

    - Score based on conceptual strength, not keyword frequency.
    - Provide brief justification for each score.

  analysis_methodology: |
    **ANALYSIS APPROACH:**
    - Focus on conceptual strength, not keyword frequency.
    - Score based on how strongly each foundation shapes the narrative's structure.
    
  json_format_instructions: |
    **JSON FORMAT:**
    Return a single JSON object. The keys should be the names of the 6 foundations 
    (e.g., "Care", "Fairness", "Loyalty", "Authority", "Sanctity", "Liberty").
    The value for each key should be an object containing a "score" (float 0.0-1.0),
    "evidence" (a quote), and "reasoning" (your justification).
    
    Example for one foundation:
    "Care": { "score": 0.8, "evidence": "...", "reasoning": "..." }
