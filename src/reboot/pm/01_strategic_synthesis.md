# 01: Strategic Synthesis for the Discernus Reboot

This document captures the synthesized strategy for the Discernus Reboot, combining the best insights from two advisory perspectives.

## The Core Problem

Both advisors correctly identified the same core issue:
- **Valuable IP:** The project's unique intellectual property—the geometric narrative visualization and the rigorous academic frameworks—is strong and genuinely novel.
- **Failing Infrastructure:** This valuable IP is being held back by a monolithic, brittle, and overly complex backend orchestrator that is unreliable and slows down research.

## Two Advisory Paths

Two distinct paths were proposed to solve this problem:

1.  **Advisor 1: The Engineer (Infrastructure-First)**
    - **Focus:** Build a robust, scalable, and reproducible pipeline for conducting experiments.
    - **Core Abstraction:** The `Discernus Experiment Specification (DES)`, a formal, machine-readable YAML file that acts as a "single source of truth."
    - **Risk:** Could lead to building a technically perfect but overly complex system that researchers find too cumbersome to use, thus hindering adoption.

2.  **Advisor 2: The Product Manager (Product-First)**
    - **Focus:** Deliver the most valuable insight (the geometric visualization) to researchers as quickly and easily as possible.
    - **Core Abstraction:** The **Conversation**. A natural-language interface ("English as Code") that hides complexity.
    - **Risk:** Could lead to building a flashy but non-reproducible demo with significant technical debt, unsuitable for serious academic research.

## Our Synthesized Strategy: The Best of Both

Our chosen path forward is a synthesis that leverages the strengths of both approaches:

> **We will build the *product* Advisor #2 described, using the *architectural blueprint* Advisor #1 provided.**

This means our guiding principle is to deliver immediate value to researchers through a simple, conversational interface, while ensuring that the underlying implementation is modular, reproducible, and scalable from day one. We achieve this by:
- **Prioritizing with "Researcher Questions":** Each development cycle is anchored to answering a specific, valuable question a researcher would ask.
- **Building with Modular Components:** We implement the answers using small, focused modules (Gateway, Engine, Reporting) as outlined in the MVP architecture.
- **Evolving the Specification:** We start with a simple, self-contained "Experiment File" for the MVP and allow it to evolve into the more comprehensive DES as new researcher questions demand new features.

This strategy allows us to move fast and deliver user value (Advisor #2's goal) without sacrificing the rigor, reproducibility, and long-term technical health of the platform (Advisor #1's goal).
