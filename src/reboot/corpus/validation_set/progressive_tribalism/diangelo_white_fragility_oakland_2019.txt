[Dr. Robin DiAngelo's White Fragility Lecture begins]

We left off the table, right? So whenever we have professional development or any kind of education, our courses on racism or race relations, we tend to study them. We learn about this group and this group and this group, and their struggles and their triumphs, and what we need to know when we're working with this group or that group. But what we rarely ever ask is, "Struggles in relation to whom? Triumphs in relation to whom or what?" Who am I as I interact across this racial difference? So dominant culture or whiteness is consistently left off the table. And that, again, is only one road in, but it is the road I'm going to take tonight.

And so I want to position myself in this right away: I am white. Check me out, everybody. And part of being white is drawing your attention to my race, like I did just now, goes against all my socialization. I was not raised to think of myself in racial terms. I understood that somebody had race, but not really me. And if we're going to be talking about race, you'd be talking about their race, not mine. I wasn't raised to see my race as significant to anything you could know about me. So what if I'm white? Well, I'm really clear today, after a good 20 years of day in and day out talking to people about race, really clear: I'm white. I have a white frame of reference. I have a white worldview. And I move through the world with a white experience. And it is not just a universal human experience as I was taught to believe; it is most particularly a white experience in a society that is deeply separate and unequal by race. So while I'm always coming from that position and that perspective, I just want to be explicit about it tonight. And when I say "we" in "us," I'm talking to the vast majority of people in this room, and in any room, and certainly any room that has a table where decisions are being made that affect the lives of people who are not at that table, right?

So let me just say a little bit about what I hope will be valuable about this focus for the people of color here tonight. First of all, what I hope will be valuable is that I'm going to name and admit to things in my short period of time in front of you that white people will rarely ever name or admit to. And if you've ever scratched your head wondering, "How do they pull this off? Can they really not see this? And why are they so resistant to seeing this?" I will help you with that because you have to navigate my reality on a daily basis in a way that I'm really sorry to say, I can be seen as qualified to lead virtually anything with no understanding whatsoever of your reality, and to be really honest, no interest in understanding that reality. And so I hope that that is useful to you with the gaslighting that happens so often.

I also want to acknowledge that so much of what I can articulate today about what it means to be white rests on years and years of brilliant and patient mentorship from people of color. People of color have been saying what I'm going to say tonight for hundreds of years at this point. And unfortunately, one of the dynamics of implicit bias is if you are white, whether you're aware of it or not, you're a little more likely to be a little more open to hear it from me. And so if I can use this position in this way to break with white solidarity, I'm going to use it. Hmm, and that invokes the master's tools dilemma, right? As I think that Darlene referred to, "How do you challenge the master's house when you only have the tools of that house, when you're in the house?" So I want to be really clear that I am aware that as I stand on this stage with credibility and authority granted to my voice on racism, no less, like virtually every other teacher or professor or role model or authority figure, I am reinforcing the centrality of whiteness. I want to name that. And trust me, I've gone home many a night and tossed and turned over that. Where I always land is that it is a both-end, right? To not use this position in this way for me is to really be white. And I'd like to be a little less white, right? And a little less white, by the way, does not mean a little more Italian-American. It means a little less oppressive, quite frankly; a little less oblivious and arrogant and ignorant and certain; and a little more humble and curious and vulnerable.

The last thing that I want to acknowledge is that nothing in society gives any of us good information about how this works. And so hopefully, again, as an insider, I can offer something to people of color. I do think people of color know about white fragility way more than I ever will, but again, I do have an insider's perspective. So let me say a little bit about some of the challenges of trying to educate white people on racism. And a great example is, I was recently going to give a similar talk to a large tech company. And before they would sign the contract, the legal department wanted to see my slides. And when they got to this slide, they actually asked me if I could take the word "white" off the slide. To which I replied, "You really should have vetted me before you called. No, I won't." First of all, I've never met a white person who doesn't have an opinion on racism. Have you? If you are not sure all white people have an opinion on racism, just bring it up the next time you're around a bunch of white people, maybe tonight, when you have a drink in Noe Valley. I don't think you can grow up in this society, or spend any significant time here, or any other Western-oriented white settler colonial context, and not develop an opinion on racism. That doesn't make it informed. So I'm going to say perhaps my first controversial thing: If you're white, I'm sure you have an opinion on the topic, and I don't know virtually anyone in this room, and yet I am confident to say the following: If you are white and you have not devoted years of sustained study, struggle, and focus on this topic, your opinions are necessarily limited, superficial, and uninformed.

Wow, how can I say that? I don't even know you. I mean, maybe you've been to Costa Rica. Maybe you have multiracial nieces and nephews. Maybe you were in Teach for America. I can say it because nothing in dominant culture gives us the information we would need to have an informed opinion on arguably the most complex, nuanced social dilemma for the last several hundred years. For example, you can get through graduate school in this country without ever discussing racism. Can you not? You can get through teacher education in this country without ever discussing racism. And if you're in a progressive teacher education program, you'll have one required course, multicultural of some sort. But that doesn't mean you'll be discussing racism. You might just be talking about how to introduce ethnic authors in February. You can get through law school. You can be seen as qualified to lead anything virtually, right?

So the first challenge for those of us who are white is humility. I want you to know that I'm not standing in front of the choir right now. Even if you volunteered to come, there is no white choir. I am not the choir. And the moment I think I'm the choir, I'm going to be complacent and arrogant and probably defensive about any suggestion that I might not be as much of the choir as I think that I am.

Second challenge is that if I do a good job, this won't be comfortable, particularly for the white people in the room, for the whole time. The status quo is racism, and as a white person, that's comfortable for me virtually 24/7. So I'm not here to uphold that. I want to unsettle that, because we will not get where we need to go from a place of white comfort. The key is what we do with those moments of discomfort. If I manage to stimulate them, we can certainly use them as a way out. Or we can also ideally use them as a relatively rare way in: "Why does this unsettle me? What would it mean if it were true?" And there are two places where white people begin to get uncomfortable when I give a talk, whether you can consciously articulate it to yourself or not. The first place is how often I'm going to say the word "white" -- so prepare yourself, about a hundred times. And we're not used to being seen racially, and we're not used to having people proceed as if our race has meaning. And the second place where we can begin to get uncomfortable is that I am going to challenge the very precious ideology of individualism, and I'm going to do it by generalizing about white people all night long. And you're going to be just fine.

Hey, it is a very precious ideology in general. I'm talking about the white collective. We don't like to be generalized about. And so just so you know, if I thought it was racist to generalize about white people, I wouldn't do it. So you don't have to send that email. You can actually ask yourself, "Well, might I be missing something if I don't understand it?" rather than, "She must be doing that wrong." Hey, yes, we are individuals, of course. And I couldn't possibly hold every person's story in this room even if I wanted to. We are also members of a social group. By virtue of our membership in this social group, we could literally predict whether you and your mother were going to survive your birth, regardless of your age. We can predict how long you're going to live because you're a member of this social group. There's a collective experience to being white. There are shared messages. We are all swimming in the same water, right? And just like gender, the way you respond to gender socialization, your challenges to gender socialization, you may have them, there's variations, but nobody can avoid dealing with gender socialization and responding to it. It is the same with racial socialization, right? So every moment that you want to exempt yourself, try this: "All right, she's saying most white people X. I was a Y." Okay, good for you. You were Y. Most are X. How did Y set you up into the racial hierarchy you live in, swimming, grew up in, breathe in, right? It sets you up differently than X set me up, but we both got set up. It's on you to use everything you see as unique about yourself and figure out how it set you up rather than exempted you.

And finally, we don't tend to understand the systemic nature of racism. So let's just start there. And I'm going to do this the way that I always do this to explain the difference between personal prejudice that everybody has and systemic racism. So prejudice, prejudgment, everyone has it. There is no human objectivity. We get it from everywhere across our lifespans. Most of it is not conscious. I would highly suggest, and I think it's being sold out there, Dr. Jennifer Eberhardt's new book, "Biased," where she pulls together all the research, and the research is clear: All of us have prejudice. I'll use the term bias, and most of it is implicit or unconscious, and therefore, all of us act on it. The way you see the world drives the way you respond to the world, right? So everybody has it, everybody does it. But when you back one group's collective racial bias with legal authority and institutional control, it is transformed into a far-reaching system that becomes the default. It becomes automatic. It's not dependent on your friendliness or your good intentions, right? So it gets embedded in all the institutions, and also in cultural definitions of what's even normal. I.e., what is professionalism? What is intelligence? Whose stories are told by whom? Whose stories are not told? Right? And I'm going to use an example from one form of oppression to launch us into the form we're here to talk about tonight. So we're here to talk about racism. I'm very clear you can't really separate these out, but for our purposes, we're going to take a focused look on racism. I'm going to draw from an example from the form called sexism. And relax, I'm going to use dominant language because I'm going to use this the way our textbooks teach us, right? So hang in there.

Women got the right to vote in this country in 1920. There was only one possible way that women could get the right to vote, and that was for men to give it to us. Women couldn't vote on the right to vote. They couldn't even speak in many public forums to advocate for their right to vote. Could a woman be prejudiced against a man and mean to him in a one-on-one interaction? Of course. Could women as a group literally deny every single man in the society his civil rights? No. Could men deny every woman in the society her civil rights? Yes. And that is a significant difference that must be acknowledged in language, right? So think about today, in 2019, I'm going to offer you a question: Today, if men as a group wanted to take away our right to vote, could they? Now, that's a little easier to see today than it was about 10 years ago when I first started asking this question. But I have been asking this question for many years, because this is the best example of the difference between individual prejudice and institutional power. You know, when yours is backed. And most people, when I ask for that question, there's confusion. They're not so clear. Some people are sure that they could. Some are not, which is also part of how oppression works.

So let me just show you some basic statistics from 2019. The Fortune 500 CEOs are 98% male. The 10 richest Americans are all men. Seven of them are the richest people in the world. I think economic power is probably the ultimate form. The presidency and the vice presidency has always been 100% male. The Senate -- keep in mind we're celebrating the most diverse Senate, Congress we've ever had -- 75% male. House of Representatives, 70% male. The current cabinet, 84% male. U.S. mayors, 80% male. U.S. governors, 84% male. Federal judges, 87% male. Police officers, 85% male. So just ask you again, if they wanted to. I'm not saying they would. My point is, by definition, institutional power is deeply embedded in the fabric of society. It's embedded across history. These are not flexible systems. Heads up, we live in patriarchy. We live in an androcentric, male-dominated, patriarchal society. We always have. And it didn't end in 1920. And I'm very confident that if Hillary Clinton had become president, patriarchy wasn't going to end that day, any more than -- I mean, if the word patriarchy came out of her mouth, any more than we can see that racism did not end upon Obama's presidency. I would argue it got an infusion. All systems of oppression can allow for exceptions. The rule will be consistent, right? 2019.

And just in case you need a visual on my claim that we live in patriarchy, this is the House Freedom Caucus. This is arguably the most powerful committee in the nation. Talk about making decisions at the table that will affect the lives of people who are not at that table. They're literally discussing the healthcare bill when this picture was taken. In case you need an image from popular culture, this is the cover of Vanity Fair. This is the slide I made. I don't even know who it is. I just Googled "white guy" and I got this. And I thought, "Oh, that's it. That's a good one." If you have young people in your life, and if you have kind of self-awareness yourself, you know that children are deeply shaped by films, by media, by imagery and marketing, right? The way that they think about the world and understand the world. And all of us pretty much have been deeply shaped by film. Those who write and direct film are our cultural narrators, and they shape how we see ourselves and how we see ourselves in relation to other people, and of the 100 top-grossing films of all time across the world disseminated from the U.S., 99 were directed by men. And 99, 95 of them white. Institutional power is the ability to disseminate your worldview to everyone and to shape how they see themselves, how they see you, how they see themselves in a relationship to you; to tell the story of the other when you are not in relationship with the other, when you don't know the other; to be able to represent the other and to do it and position yourself as simply telling universal human stories, not from any particular position. So that Michael E. is a film director who makes films about the human condition. And Spike Lee is a black film director who makes films about black issues.

So Facebook puts these things out on holidays. This one came out to commemorate the anniversary of women gaining suffrage. And then some folks did this: "Which women got access to the vote in 1920?" Yeah, white women. So another dimension of institutional power is that your group's experience is held up as universal. So while we were oppressed as women, we were certainly privileged as white. There is no more universal woman's experience than there is a universal human experience on the physical plane where we live in the here and now. And that recognition, I'm sure many of you know, was coined by Dr. Kimberlé Crenshaw: intersectionality, right? So legal authority and institutional control is what transforms people's prejudice into a far-reaching system. So let's look at race in 2019, right? So the presidency and vice presidency, 100% white. The U.S. Senate, 91% white. I just have to point out again, the most diverse Congress we've ever had. The House of Representatives, 73% white. The current cabinet, 89% white. The governors, 98% white. Mayors, 88% white. Military advisors -- just think about who we go to war with -- 100% white. Federal judges, 8% white. Police officers, 80% white. The people who decide which TV shows we see, 93% white. The people who decide which books we read, 90% white. People who decide which news is covered, 85% white. People who decide which music is produced, 95% white. School teachers, 82% white. Full-time college professors, 84% white. Owners of men's pro football teams, 97% white. Owners of men's pro basketball teams, 98% white. The players, 75% black.

And yet what is the definition of a racist? Of what it means to be racist in the mainstream, right? Well, it's an individual, always an individual, not a system, who consciously does not like people based on race. Apparently, if it's not conscious, it doesn't count, and is intentionally mean to them. It also has to be intentional to count: individual, conscious, mal-intent across race. That is a racist. And I don't know that you could come up with a better definition to protect the system of racism than this one, because this definition makes it virtually impossible to talk to the average white person about the inevitable absorption of a racist worldview that we get from living in a culture in which it is infused and embedded across all its institutions, right? I think that this definition is the root of virtually all white defensiveness on this topic. Have you guys noticed any white defensiveness on this topic? Because if that's my definition of a racist, and you've just suggested I've said or done something racist, much less that I benefit from racism just by being white, what I'm going to hear is, "You just questioned my very moral character," and now I need to defend my moral character, right? And I will.

So racism is a system, not an event. There certainly occurs in specific moments that we can identify, but of course it's 365, 24/7. It's the system we're in. And part of being raised as a white person in this society has been to be raised to be what I think of as functionally illiterate on this topic. I had opinions. I spouted them freely. I cringe today when I think about that. And part of gaining literacy, and of course that is a lifelong process, I will not be finished with. Part of gaining literacy has been to understand the kind of collective dimensions of racism, but also how different groups of color get set up differently. So what's in my head about indigenous peoples is different than what's in my head about Asian heritage people, and that's different than what's in there about African heritage people. I have different levels of comfort and anxiety and interest, etc. And therefore those groups have different experiences. Okay? And it's very important that we break that down and that we learn those histories and those struggles and those stereotypes and those experiences. So I want to be really clear: All peoples who are not perceived or defined as white experience racism, and they experience it in shared ways, and they experience it in ways that are different depending on their group and it's positioned to whiteness.

Having said that, after 20 years of doing this work, I feel very clear about the following: There is something profoundly anti-black in this culture and in the white mind. Black people are the ultimate racial other. We have the most energy about black people. We have the most resentment and anxiety about black people. And when I have a very short period of time with white people, and I want you to get in touch with your early messages, I ask you to think about black people, right? And anti-blackness. But there are poles, right? White is here and black is here. And we -- and I don't have time to get into it, but there is no white without black. There's a deep need for white, the white collective. There is no superiority without inferiority, right? So there are poles, and anti-blackness cuts across all groups, including black people. The darker you are, the more compounded the oppression. And while I'm here to challenge white people in our complacency, there's a very sensitive couple of questions I think people of color have to ask themselves: One, what is anti-blackness look like in our group? And who have I aligned with?

So having mentioned history, anti-blackness, it's a system. I want to just give you one glance at the trajectory of anti-blackness since the beginning of this country to the current time to illustrate those points. And this slide will be deliberately dense, and we can think about it as state-sanctioned organized crime, quite frankly, against African-Americans. And it begins with kidnapping and 300-plus years of enslavement, torture, rape, and brutality. And it carries on about a quarter of the way in here: bans on testifying against whites. And you were in my lifetime, a quarter of the way in that slide, you were in my lifetime where it was technically legal to murder black people in this country. I would love to never again hear another white person say, "I didn't own slaves," as if that ended on that day. And about halfway in at employment discrimination, you are now in 2019 with copious empirical evidence. And if you don't know some of these things, that's on you to educate yourself. But I'm going to pick it up in 2019 and let me repeat, copious empirical evidence: employment discrimination, educational discrimination, biased laws and policing, white flight, subprime mortgages, mass incarceration, school to prison pipeline, disproportionate special education referrals and punishments, testing, tracking, school funding, biased media, voter suppression, cultural mockery, historical omissions, unaddressed trauma, to name a few. It's a system. It's the system we're in. And none of us could be in, none of us were exempt from its forces. And this system is not interrupted by friendliness. The system is not interrupted because I smile at black people when I pass them by, or go to lunch on occasion. And African Americans are not and have never been in the position to do this to the entire white collective, and the white collective has always been and continues to be in the position to do this to African Americans. There is no such thing as reverse racism.

All right, now I know I'm going to need to update this picture pretty soon here, but I can't let go of it yet because when I saw it, I -- you can just take a wild guess how I feel about Paul Ryan, but that's not why I picked it. When I saw this picture, I just thought, "This is what it means to be white." These are his incoming interns. These are our future politicians. These are the people who will sit at the tables making decisions about the lives of those who are not at the table, and who they have not been taught are valuable to know or consider or understand. I want you to imagine the neighborhood they likely grew up in, right? The schools they likely went to, the teachers they likely have, the friendship circles, their wedding albums. And now imagine that these are our future medical researchers. These are our future school teachers. These are our future social workers, our future lawyers, etc. And this is the position from which white people claim, "We're objective on race." Just get that, get that image back in your mind of that, of that history slide, and then just look at this. This is last year's college champion Jeopardy playoff. So those are our best and our brightest, soon to be certified as highly educated from our institutions of higher learning. And that's the board at the end of the Grand Champion round. So as we can see, there was one category not one of them touched. Clearly the most difficult. Nobody was going to risk losing the Grand Championship. You know, it's just one picture. I think it speaks volumes. And I don't feel that I can do justice to what it means, though we don't know our history, that we could ever separate it out and see it as their history, not the history of this country, because we don't know our history and we cannot trace it into the present. We are left with deeply problematic explanations for current conditions, victim-blaming explanations.

So I want to walk you through some questions. I'm going to ask you. You can close your eyes. You can look down at the ground. I just want to in your mind, I want you to notice what images and what narratives come up for you. And I would like you to answer these questions from your childhood self, your younger self, maybe 10, 11, 12. What do you see and how would you explain it? So how racially diverse was your neighborhood growing up? If your neighborhood was not racially diverse, why wasn't it? Where did people of different races than you live? If they didn't live in your neighborhood, where did they live and what was it like where people of different races than yourself lived and how did you know what images come to your mind when you think about the spaces where they were? Why didn't you live in the same neighborhood? Why don't we live in the same neighborhood? Were you encouraged to visit the neighborhoods where people that were of a different race than you lived and get to know the people there, build relationships with them, or were you discouraged from doing that? And if so, how? How was that conveyed to you? What were the characteristics of a good school? What makes a school good? What are the characteristics of a bad school? What makes a school bad? What's it like in a bad school? What images do you get? Did your parents care about what kind of school you went to? Did they have any energy about that? And if so, why? Were the honors or advanced placement classes and the lower track classes equally racially integrated? And if not, why not? How often have you had a teacher or professor of your own race or races, if you're multiracial? How often have you been to a wedding that was either all or virtually all white? If we opened your wedding album, if you're married, what would we notice? How often have you been to a funeral that was virtually all white or all white? And what are some of the ways in which your race has shaped your life?

So I ask these questions to get to the earlier messaging. I have a pretty good idea of the patterns that rose up as you thought about them. And yet when you put all this together, right, our socialization into deep racist bias, our definition of a racist as a mean, bad person, you get some rather superficial white narratives. So I want to be really clear about something: As a result of being raised in this society, I have a racist worldview. I have racist biases. I have racist patterns that have developed as a result of that. And I also have investments in the system of racism. It's quite comfortable. And it has helped me overcome the barriers that I have faced. For example, in my early childhood, I did go to diverse schools because I grew up in poverty. But as I moved upwards, upwardly-mobile, it got whiter and whiter. And nobody ever encouraged me to maintain those relationships across race. So being white has definitely helped me navigate the barriers I faced. And I also have an investment in not seeing anything I just named, which is why I'm the least likely to be able to determine how well I'm doing. I did not choose to be socialized into a racist worldview, racist patterns, and racist investments. I didn't. I didn't have the choice. And it's actually incredibly liberating to start from the premise that of course I was socialized into it, and so I can stop defending, deflecting, denying. I don't struggle with guilt about that, right? I feel responsible for that socialization, right? So starting from that premise actually is liberating because I could just get to work trying to identify what it's looking like in my life, in my relationships, and in my work. But not starting from that premise leads us to say some rather superficial things.

Darlene acknowledged that my area of scholarship is in critical discourse analysis, and that is the critical examination of language. That words and terms are not just neutral descriptors for something. That the language that we have shapes how we view that thing, which is why language is always political and always a site of struggle. And as I listen to the things that white people say when the topic of racism comes up, I literally got this image in my mind of a dock. And it signifies two things: One, how superficial just this is what we say. But also, if you look at the dock from up above, it looks like it's just floating on the water, right? But it's not just floating on the water. It's resting on an entire structure that's submerged underneath that props it up. And everything I do in my work is I try to get us off the top and get under there and look at that structure. Because despite what's on the top, our outcomes are not changing, right? And so I kind of think of them in two sets: colorblind and color celebrate. Probably the number one of the colorblind is, "I was taught to treat everyone the same." Anybody ever heard that one? Some version of, "I was taught to treat everyone the same." Not one single person in this room was taught to treat everyone the same. You weren't. You don't. You couldn't. And you couldn't be taught to do it. You could be told to do it. I could you do it. You don't do it. Can't do it. Don't even want to do it because people have different needs. So when I hear this from a white person, there is a bubble over my head. I've got a couple things in it: 100%, this person doesn't understand basic socialization. This person doesn't understand culture. This person is not self-aware. And I just need to give a heads up to the people, to the white people in the room -- and I'm going to look at Darlene because Darlene will, will call me if I, if I miss it here -- to the white people in the room, when people of color hear us say that, they're generally not thinking, "Oh, I'm talking to a woke white person right now." No. Usually some version of eye-rolling is going on and the wall is going up. Aaron Trent Johnson is a black woman I often co-lead with, and she says, "When I hear that from a white person, what I'm thinking is, 'This is a dangerous white person. This is a white person who's going to need to deny my reality.'" It's just not doing what we think it's doing. That's the colorblind.

Now we've got the color celebrate: "Oh, I work in a very diverse environment." I think that one's popular in Oakland. "Mm-hmm, I have people of color in my family. I'm not racist. I live in Oakland." That one gets used interchangeably with, "I'm not racist, I'm from Canada." "I'm not racist, I'm from Germany." "I'm not racist, I was in the military." Sociologists actually have a term for this one: it's called the inoculation case. "I've been near people of color. It's stripped me of all my racism." I'm always like, "Wow, you walked by people of color, you didn't lose your -- okay, that's amazing." I want you to notice how often white people invoke proximity as their evidence of a lack of racism. And this is important to notice because it helps reveal what we think racism is, right? It helps reveal what's under the dock. What do I think racism is that proximity would show that I don't have it? So these, these last three. How many of you in a conversation with a white person have heard some version of those last three? And if we're being honest, we've said some version of these, right? So let's do the discourse analysis on these. When a white person invokes one of these narratives when racism comes up, they're giving you their evidence, right? This is white people's evidence. In my mind, what is this my evidence of? What I want to make sure you know: "I'm not racist." This is not even a stretch, is it? This is what white people say to establish their lack of racism. Correct? So if this is my evidence that I'm not racist, then in order to be good evidence, it has to distinguish me from a racist, right? So a racist apparently can't do those things, or else that would not be good evidence. So a racist can't work three cubicles down from a person of color, couldn't have people of color in their family, and apparently, just living in Oakland frees the white folks from racism, right? No, no, no racists in Oakland. So a racist can't tolerate proximity based on this evidence, right? Are you starting to see how thin that is? Because even an avowed racist can tolerate proximity. I owned my racist conditioning earlier. I don't see myself as an avowed racist. An avowed racist is someone who embraces that conditioning. I seek to challenge that conditioning. But even avowed racists can interact and have proximity across race. Here's an example: So the black man is Gary Young, he's a reporter for the Guardian, and he is interviewing white nationalist Richard Spencer, the white man, right? Richard Spencer is what I would call an avowed racist. He organized the March in Charlottesville. Now look at the body language: completely relaxed. Richard Spencer's not freaking out. He's having a calm conversation with Gary Young. Richard Spencer, Michael Holman, half, you know, nieces and nephews of color in his family, right? Here he is at the March.

Children are so much more open, right? Of all the things I say, this is probably about the hardest, what I'm about to say: The research is very clear that by age three to four, all children who grow up here understand it's better to be white. No child misses the message. And it's not a singular, isolated message. It's not dependent on some mean person. That message circulates 24/7, and they know it, and they absorb it. And when we project this racial innocence on them, we leave them unattended to it. They can't resist it. So "Frozen" for me is a great example for the younger, and for the teen years, this is last year's top five runners-up for Miss Teen USA. No little girl misses the message. And yes, they are five different girls. You have to concentrate really hard. But when you give up, just go over here and look at the sides, you can see the states. I mean, just take it in. Miss Miss Teen USA. This is the group that they were drawn from, right? But is that not how it always is? There'll be one, maybe two to the back or to the side, right? And because I know my people, I am confident that for all these white girls, that one black girl is their evidence for why they're not racist. "Everybody loved her. Nobody had a problem with her." Now you get that young woman alone in a room with someone she trusts and debrief her. I can't imagine what that experience was like for her. But I want to move these white girls way past, "Were you or weren't you friendly to the black girl? If you were friendly to the black girl, you're free of all racism." I want to move them to a really different place, which is, "What's going on here? How does it keep getting reproduced? How have you been shaped by it? And what role will you play going forward to reproduce it yourself if you can't see it or understand it?" It's just a very different question.

"I was in the Peace Corps and Teach for America. I'm a minority myself. I marched in the '60s. I was on a mission for me in Africa. I've been doing this for years." So I'm going to ask another set of rhetorical questions. These are the white progressives, you know, evidence. To my dear friend Darlene, "Darlene, could a racist work three cubicles down from you? Even one who doesn't think they're racist? Even one on the equity team?" Folks on equity teams. I'm all for equity teams or whatever you call them. D&I, DEI, D&I, anything but racial equity teams if you don't want to scare the white people so don't, don't, don't put race in there. But I'm all for equity teams but I also need to say that some of the most gatekeeping, obstructionist white people are on equity teams and in equity work. And I have been in many equity teams where most of our energy was spent strategizing how to get around another white person on the equity team. So I just want to be clear that of course there are some very constructive people in, white people in that, in those teams. The key is, it doesn't certify you. Nothing certifies you. It's the complacency and the arrogance which of course sets up defensiveness. I'm going to ask another rhetorical question to the people of color in the room: "Do you have white people whom you love dearly, and who on occasion reveal a racist worldview to you?" White people, did you hear that? "Could you even be married to them?" White people need to hear that. Let me put it this way: I'm married to a man, he's a white man. Trust me, the day he fell in love with me, all his sexism did not vanish. Oh, contraire. He's a product of patriarchy, as am I. And you know, it comes out and we struggle with it. And I would never say we are free of all gender conditioning and all sexist dynamics because we love each other. But notice the moment there's fond regard, all race and racism and racial biases disappears for white people. We're very funny on this one. Well, this is probably popular in Oakland: "We don't like how white our neighborhood is or is getting, but we had to move here for the schools. What, what could we do?" I think it's disingenuous. I think we do like how white our neighborhoods are. And I don't think our kids can be exceptional and have the best if somebody didn't have less. I think that's a hard conversation we need to have. But these are of course all color celebrate narratives. You know, a seed, I embrace it. There's a question that's never failed me in my efforts to uncover, "How do we get the outcomes we're getting then if this is what's going on?" And that question isn't, "Is this true or is this false? Were you or weren't you taught to treat everyone the same?" We're going to debate that. The question that's never failed me is, "How do these narratives function in the conversation? What happens when racism gets on the table and a white person invokes one of these narratives?" And when we ask that question, I think we can see that all of them exempt the person from any part of the problem. All of them take racism off the table. Nothing to see here. In doing that, all of them close rather than open the exploration. And in doing that, all of them protect the current racial hierarchy and the white position within it. They're exemplars and closers and protectors. And you don't have to be consciously thinking, "I know what I'll do," but that's the impact that they have. We really need to ask ourselves, "What framework of meaning am I coming from that this would seem to me to be good evidence? And how do I actually know how it's landing on the other side?"

So we're going to do a little turn and talk. You have to come back when I call you. But I am going to have you turn to the person next to you. And those of you that are in this work know that we often caution white people, "Don't, don't take up all the space. Don't talk first." And because that's our usual pattern until it's a high-risk question on race. Oh, then I'm going to let the person of color go first, and then I'll just model whatever I say on whatever they just said. So if you turn to the person, your interracial, one of you is white. White person go first. Take that risk. Do not give the race work to people of color. So this question you're going to answer if you're white is basically, "How do you credential yourself in conversations about race? What moves do you make to signal that you're not racist or you're less racist?" Never mind a white person doesn't do this. I do this. I try not to do this. I catch myself doing it. And if I told you that people of color noticed when we're doing this how do you think it's actually impacting the conversation? And if you are black, indigenous, person of color, the question is, "How have you noticed white people credentialing themselves and does it work?" And just before I forget, a group of people had asked if I could go out for a drink after the talk, and I can't do that because it's Monday night. Yeah, Monday night. I have my Ta-Nehisi Coates book study group, and I always, I always follow it with a double feature of Black Panther and Get Out. My fifth time actually. And now I have to add Green Book. So I'm just booked. I can't, I'm not going to be able to go out for a drink. But I just gave you four more moves. So it could be something I've named. It could be something, but, but just how do you do it? And what do you think about it now? So just give you a couple minutes. Welcome back. Welcome back. Welcome back, everybody. Thank you.

Obviously, I can't give you the time that I'd love to give you. So keep thinking about this one. And about now, if you're white, you might be thinking, "Holy, I can't do anything and get this right." And that's true, actually, you can. So that can never be the reason for not staying in the struggle. I think the guidance I would offer is, "Show, don't tell." If it's truly integrated in the way you see the world, it will come through. It will, it will be there. You don't have to be driven by anxiety and urgency because whenever I'm driven by racial anxiety and urgency, odds are it's going to land problematically on the other side, right? And what people of color have shared with me that comes up for them when they notice us doing this are a couple things: One, in those moments they feel very racialized. They see us saying things and acting the ways we're not acting, we're with other, other white people, right? They feel objectified. And often what they're thinking is, "So like, yeah, that doesn't, that just doesn't mean anything," right? That you, whatever it was. So this was the last question I offered you in the reflection, and I want to share with you, I've been asking this question of white people for 20 years. My second book, "What Does It Mean to Be White?" is me seeking to answer this question. And I want to share with you some common patterns when I ask white people this question because usually if we have a workshop, they're in kind of dyads or triads, and they get a minute each. And I think the patterns again are very revealing.

So the first pattern is that it's a very uncomfortable question for a lot of white people to be asked. And the second pattern is that it's very difficult for us to answer it with any depth or criticality at all. I have seen so many dyads and triads of people where a white person couldn't actually fill one minute, 60 seconds. They couldn't fill it. They just let that, the time go by. And so I want to offer, and by the way, if you're a white progressive from Oakland, you could probably throw the word "privilege" in there, but it doesn't mean,
