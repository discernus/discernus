# Discernus Methodology Paper Development

**Strategic Focus:** Computational discourse analysis platform validation through systematic framework implementation and expert consultation

---

## üìã **Paper Overview**

### Title (Working)
"Systematic Framework Validation for Computational Text Analysis: The Discernus Platform"

### Strategic Objective
Position Discernus as credible **methodological infrastructure** for computational social science through rigorous validation of established frameworks rather than novel theoretical claims.

### Core Transformation
- **From**: Theoretical discovery (Three Wells Model) ‚Üí **To**: Methodological infrastructure (systematic framework comparison)
- **From**: Novel framework development ‚Üí **To**: Established framework validation (MFT, Political Framing Theory, Cultural Theory)  
- **From**: Normative advocacy ‚Üí **To**: Academic methodology contribution
- **From**: Universal claims ‚Üí **To**: Domain-specific validation with clear scope conditions

## üéØ **MVP Paper Strategy**

### Primary Framework: Moral Foundations Theory
**Academic Strategy**: Establish credibility through systematic MFT validation before expanding to additional frameworks

#### Expert Consultation Approach
- **Phase 1**: Build working MFT implementation with preliminary validation
- **Phase 2**: Approach Jonathan Haidt lab with demonstration + evidence  
- **Phase 3**: Refine implementation based on expert feedback
- **Phase 4**: Execute large-scale validation study (n=500, r>0.8 target with MFQ-30)

#### Publication Pathway
- **Co-authorship**: Jonathan Haidt and collaborators (based on expert consultation success)
- **Target Venue**: Computational Social Science, Political Psychology journals
- **Methodology Contribution**: Systematic framework validation for computational text analysis
- **Replication Package**: Complete code, data, and analysis scripts

## üî¨ **Academic Validation Strategy**

### Statistical Validation Targets
- **Overall MFT Correlation**: r>0.8 with MFQ-30 (p<0.001)
- **Foundation-Specific**: Care/Harm r>0.89, Fairness r>0.81, Loyalty r>0.78, Authority r>0.85, Sanctity r>0.79
- **Cross-LLM Reliability**: r>0.91 between GPT-4, Claude, Gemini
- **Effect Sizes**: d>0.8 for practical significance

### Expert Consultation Protocol
- **Implementation Review**: Technical accuracy assessment by framework originators
- **Methodology Validation**: Academic standards compliance verification
- **Collaboration Framework**: Co-authorship and publication planning
- **Community Endorsement**: Computational social science network recommendations

### Success Criteria
- **Academic**: Expert endorsement + Statistical validation + Publication acceptance
- **Community**: Computational social science researcher adoption
- **Platform**: Credible infrastructure for systematic framework comparison
- **Methodological**: Contribution to computational social science validation practices
