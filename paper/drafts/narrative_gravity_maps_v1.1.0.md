# Narrative Gravity Maps: A Quantitative Framework for Discerning the Forces Driving Persuasive Narratives

**Version 1.1.0 - Circular Coordinate System Architecture**

## Abstract

Contemporary political discourse faces an unprecedented crisis of moral clarity and epistemic integrity. This paper introduces **Narrative Gravity Maps**, a quantitative methodology for mapping and analyzing the forces that drive persuasive narrative formation. The methodology positions conceptual "gravity wells" on a circular coordinate system, enabling systematic measurement of narrative positioning and trajectory with universal tool compatibility and intuitive interpretation.

We demonstrate this approach through the **Civic Virtue Framework**, a specialized implementation designed for moral analysis of persuasive political discourse. This framework maps narratives along five core dipoles—such as Dignity vs. Tribalism and Truth vs. Manipulation—representing tensions between integrative civic virtues and disintegrative rhetorical forces. **Technical implementation demonstrates cross-model consistency with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.90 across multiple LLM platforms, though validation against human judgment remains a critical area for future research.**

**The circular coordinate architecture enables framework developers to independently control positional arrangement (visual rhetoric), mathematical weighting (analytical power), and algorithmic enhancement (technical sophistication), supporting both normative frameworks like Civic Virtue and descriptive approaches like Moral Foundations Theory.** Case studies of Trump and Biden inaugural addresses demonstrate the framework's capacity for quantitative differentiation between contrasting political approaches, with radial distance metrics providing precise measurement of computational rhetorical positioning.

Unlike purely descriptive approaches, Narrative Gravity Maps make explicit normative distinctions while maintaining technical consistency and computational reproducibility. The methodology provides a systematic computational tool for analyzing how persuasive narratives position themselves along specified moral and rhetorical dimensions, though validation against human moral perception requires further research.

## 1. Introduction

Contemporary political discourse faces an unprecedented crisis of moral clarity and epistemic integrity. As Jonathan Rauch argues in *The Constitution of Knowledge*, the health of liberal democracy depends not only on formal institutions and free speech, but on a shared constitution of knowledge—a set of norms and practices that allow societies to distinguish truth from falsehood and sustain civil dialogue. The erosion of these norms, fueled by polarization, disinformation, and the decline of religious and moral frameworks, has left democratic societies increasingly vulnerable to manipulation and division.

This crisis manifests in the coarsening of public debate, the weaponization of moral language for partisan advantage, and the collapse of shared standards for evaluating persuasive narratives. Citizens and institutions lack systematic tools for discerning the moral quality of political discourse, leaving democratic societies vulnerable to narratives that undermine the very foundations of pluralistic governance.

This paper introduces **Narrative Gravity Maps**, a general quantitative methodology for mapping and analyzing the forces that drive persuasive narrative formation. We demonstrate this methodology through the **Civic Virtue Framework**, our most advanced implementation designed specifically for moral analysis of political discourse. The methodology positions conceptual "gravity wells" on a circular coordinate system, enabling systematic measurement of narrative positioning and trajectory. Unlike purely descriptive approaches, Narrative Gravity Maps make explicit normative distinctions while maintaining analytical rigor and cultural adaptability through modular framework implementations.

**Version 1.1.0 introduces a circular coordinate architecture** that maximizes researcher adoption while preserving analytical sophistication. This design enables framework developers to independently control three dimensions: positional arrangement (visual rhetoric), mathematical weighting (analytical power), and algorithmic enhancement (technical sophistication), supporting diverse theoretical commitments from normative frameworks to descriptive approaches.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations and Literature Review

### 2.1 The Crisis of Moral and Epistemic Discourse

Political discourse in liberal democracies has experienced significant degradation in recent decades. Survey data from the Pew Research Center consistently shows declining trust in institutions, increasing polarization, and growing concern about the quality of public debate. This erosion of civic discourse threatens the moral and epistemic foundations necessary for democratic governance.

Historical analysis reveals that the deterioration of moral standards in public discourse has often preceded democratic decline and the rise of authoritarianism. As Francis Fukuyama argues in *Political Order and Political Decay*, the stability of democratic institutions depends fundamentally on shared values, trust, and social capital. When these moral foundations erode, societies become vulnerable to populist manipulation and institutional breakdown.

### 2.2 Existing Frameworks and Their Limitations

Current approaches to moral analysis of political discourse fall into two categories: purely descriptive frameworks that avoid normative judgments, and philosophical approaches that lack empirical grounding.

**Moral Foundations Theory (MFT)**, developed by Jonathan Haidt and colleagues, provides a descriptive framework for understanding moral reasoning across cultures and political orientations. MFT identifies six moral foundations: Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation, and Liberty/Oppression. While influential, MFT explicitly avoids normative declarations about which moral orientations are superior, limiting its utility for evaluating the democratic health of persuasive narratives.

**Philosophical approaches** from Rawls, Kant, and others provide robust normative frameworks but lack systematic methods for analyzing real-world political discourse. These approaches offer theoretical clarity but limited practical tools for citizens and institutions seeking to evaluate contemporary narratives.

### 2.3 The Need for Normative Analytical Tools

The current moment demands analytical frameworks that combine empirical rigor with normative clarity. As David Brooks argues in *The Road to Character*, moral character serves as the "X-factor that holds societies together." Citizens and institutions need practical tools for distinguishing between narratives that strengthen democratic discourse and those that undermine it.

This need has motivated the development of **Narrative Gravity Maps**—a general methodology that can be instantiated through multiple specialized frameworks depending on the analytical context and normative goals.

## 3. Narrative Gravity Maps: General Methodology

### 3.1 Methodological Overview

Narrative Gravity Maps provide a quantitative methodology for mapping the moral and rhetorical forces within persuasive texts. The core innovation lies in positioning conceptual "gravity wells" on a circular coordinate system, where each well represents a distinct moral or rhetorical orientation that exerts attractive force proportional to a narrative's alignment with that orientation.

**Circular Coordinate Architecture**: Version 1.1.0 adopts a circular coordinate system that maximizes researcher adoption while preserving analytical sophistication. Unlike previous elliptical approaches that required specialized mathematical knowledge, circular coordinates use standard polar positioning familiar to all researchers, ensuring universal tool compatibility across R, Python, Stata, and visualization platforms.

This methodology can be instantiated through various specialized frameworks, each defining different sets of conceptual dipoles appropriate to specific analytical contexts. We have developed multiple framework implementations:

- **Civic Virtue Framework**: Our most advanced implementation, designed for moral analysis of political discourse
- **Political Spectrum Framework**: Focused on left-right political positioning  
- **Rhetorical Posture Framework**: Emphasizing communication style and approach

While this methodology can support many specialized frameworks, this paper focuses primarily on demonstrating the approach through our Civic Virtue Framework implementation.

### 3.2 Three Independent Design Dimensions

A key architectural innovation distinguishing Narrative Gravity Maps from simpler analytical approaches is the separation of three independent design dimensions, each controlled by framework developers:

#### 3.2.1 Positional Arrangement (Visual Rhetoric)

Framework developers control the angular positioning of wells on the circular boundary to reflect their theoretical commitments:

**Normative Frameworks** (like Civic Virtue): Position "good" wells in the upper hemisphere and "problematic" wells in the lower hemisphere, creating visual hierarchy that reinforces moral judgments.

**Descriptive Frameworks** (like Moral Foundations Theory): Use neutral, balanced positioning that avoids visual implications of moral superiority or inferiority.

**Custom Arrangements**: Any positioning scheme supported by theoretical justification, enabling diverse visual rhetoric approaches.

#### 3.2.2 Mathematical Weighting (Analytical Power)

Independent of positional arrangement, frameworks assign numerical weights to wells based on theoretical importance:

**Hierarchical Weighting**: Different tiers of importance (e.g., Identity 1.0, Principles 0.8, Moderators 0.6) reflecting research findings about differential moral influence.

**Equal Weighting**: All dimensions weighted equally (1.0) when theoretical commitments assume equivalent importance.

**Custom Weighting**: Any numerical scheme justified by empirical evidence or theoretical argument.

#### 3.2.3 Algorithmic Enhancement (Technical Sophistication)

Mathematical algorithms for processing raw scores remain consistent across frameworks while enabling sophisticated analysis:

**Dominance Amplification**: Exponential enhancement of extreme scores (>0.7) to ensure genuine extremes reach visualization boundaries.

**Adaptive Scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on narrative extremeness, utilizing more boundary space for truly extreme cases.

**Boundary Snapping**: Gentle adjustment toward boundaries for narratives demonstrating clear dominance patterns.

These enhancements work identically regardless of framework positioning or weighting choices, ensuring technical consistency while preserving theoretical flexibility.

**Design Choices:**
- **Positional**: Neutral arrangement (no moral hierarchy implied)
- **Weighting**: Equal across all foundations (descriptive stance)
- **Enhancement**: Same algorithmic sophistication, different theoretical frame

### 3.4 Coordinate System Selection Rationale

**Elliptical vs. Circular Analysis**: Early versions employed elliptical coordinates to emphasize moral hierarchy through vertical elongation. However, systematic analysis revealed that elliptical systems impose significant adoption barriers:

- **Mathematical Complexity**: Researchers require specialized knowledge of elliptical geometry
- **Tool Incompatibility**: Limited support in standard statistical and visualization software
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Aspect ratio changes break existing analyses
- **Export Challenges**: Publishing tools don't expect non-standard coordinate systems

**Circular Advantages**: The circular architecture preserves all analytical capabilities while dramatically improving usability:

- **Universal Comprehension**: Standard polar coordinates familiar to all researchers
- **Tool Compatibility**: Native support in R, Python, Stata, Tableau, Excel, and academic publishing platforms
- **Parameter Robustness**: Radius scaling maintains interpretive consistency
- **Framework Flexibility**: Enables independent control of visual rhetoric through positional arrangement

**Mathematical Sophistication Preserved**: All analytical enhancements (dominance amplification, adaptive scaling, boundary optimization) work equally effectively with circular coordinates while eliminating implementation complexity.

## 4. The Civic Virtue Framework Implementation

### 4.1 Framework Overview and Demonstration

```
TODO: Generate publication-ready Mandela visualization
ASCII Placeholder shows narrative positioning result from analysis
```

Figure 1 presents the Civic Virtue Framework analysis of Nelson Mandela's 1994 Inaugural Address, demonstrating how this implementation maps moral forces in political discourse. The visualization positions ten "gravity wells" on the circular boundary, with integrative civic virtues (Dignity, Justice, Truth, Pragmatism, Hope) in the upper hemisphere and disintegrative rhetorical forces (Tribalism, Resentment, Manipulation, Fear, Fantasy) in the lower hemisphere. Mandela's speech positions strongly in the upper-right quadrant, reflecting high narrative elevation toward civic virtue (y = 0.73) and moderate pragmatic orientation.

This positioning immediately reveals the speech's moral trajectory—constructive, dignity-centered, and forward-looking—while the mathematical precision enables quantitative comparison across different persuasive narratives.

### 4.2 Mathematical Foundation

The visualization emerges from a rigorous mathematical framework that positions narratives based on gravitational pull from boundary wells using circular coordinates.

#### 4.2.1 Circular Coordinate System

The framework employs a standard circular coordinate system with:
- **Radius**: r = 1.0 (unit circle)
- **Angular positioning**: θ ∈ [0°, 360°) for well placement

Wells are positioned using standard polar coordinate equations:

$$x_i = r \cos(\theta_i)$$
$$y_i = r \sin(\theta_i)$$

Where $\theta_i$ is the angular position of well $i$ in degrees.

#### 4.2.2 Narrative Positioning with Algorithmic Enhancement

Narratives are positioned inside the circle based on weighted gravitational pull from boundary wells, enhanced through sophisticated algorithms:

**Base Positioning:**
$$x_n = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i \cdot s_i \cdot x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i \cdot s_i}$$

$$y_n = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i \cdot s_i \cdot y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{10} w_i \cdot s_i}$$

**Dominance Amplification:**
$$s_{enhanced} = \begin{cases}
1.0 + (s - 0.7)^{2.0} \times 0.8 & \text{if } s \geq 0.7 \\
s \times 1.1 & \text{if } 0.3 < s < 0.7 \\
(s / 0.3)^{1.5} & \text{if } s \leq 0.3
\end{cases}$$

**Adaptive Scaling:**
$$\alpha = 0.65 + \text{extremeness} \times (0.95 - 0.65)$$

**Final Position:**
$$x_{final} = x_n \times \alpha$$
$$y_{final} = y_n \times \alpha$$

Where:
- $x_n, y_n$ = narrative position coordinates
- $w_i$ = moral weight of well $i$ (positive for integrative, negative for disintegrative)
- $s_i$ = narrative score for well $i$ (0 to 1)
- $x_i, y_i$ = well position on circle boundary
- $\alpha$ = adaptive scaling factor (0.65 to 0.95)

### 4.3 Defining the Civic Virtue Dipoles

The Civic Virtue Framework organizes moral forces into five dipoles, each representing a fundamental tension between civic virtues and disintegrative rhetorical forces:

**Dignity vs. Tribalism (Identity Dimension, Weight: 1.0)**
- **Dignity (0°)**: Affirms individual moral worth based on character and agency, regardless of group identity
- **Tribalism (180°)**: Subordinates individual agency to group identity; seeks status through group dominance

**Justice vs. Resentment (Fairness Dimension, Weight: 0.8)**
- **Justice (135°)**: Seeks impartial, rule-based fairness through institutional reform
- **Resentment (225°)**: Centers on historical grievance and moral scorekeeping in zero-sum terms

**Truth vs. Manipulation (Integrity Dimension, Weight: 0.8)**
- **Truth (45°)**: Demonstrates intellectual honesty, admits uncertainty, engages with complexity
- **Manipulation (315°)**: Distorts information or exploits emotion to control interpretation

**Pragmatism vs. Fear (Stability Dimension, Weight: 0.6)**
- **Pragmatism (285°)**: Emphasizes evidence-based, iterative problem-solving with attention to trade-offs
- **Fear (200°)**: Focuses on threat and loss, often exaggerating danger to justify measures

**Hope vs. Fantasy (Aspiration Dimension, Weight: 0.6)**
- **Hope (315°)**: Offers grounded optimism with realistic paths forward
- **Fantasy (255°)**: Promises final solutions or utopian outcomes without acknowledging complexity

## 5. Validation and Implementation Results

### 5.1 Enhanced Algorithm Performance Validation

**Boundary Utilization Testing**: Analysis of synthetic extreme narratives demonstrates significant improvement in visualization boundary utilization:

- **Baseline (Linear Mathematics)**: 37.5% of circular space utilized
- **Enhanced (Algorithmic Improvements)**: 60.0% of circular space utilized
- **Improvement**: +60% better boundary representation

**Real vs. Synthetic Validation**: Enhanced algorithms correctly differentiate between designed extreme test cases and real-world moderate positioning:

- **Synthetic Extremes**: 0.539-0.600 distance from center (approaching boundaries as designed)
- **Real Speech Analysis**: 0.052 distance from center (moderate positioning for mixed rhetoric)
- **System Validity**: Proper mathematical behavior across artificial and genuine cases

### 5.2 Cross-LLM Consistency Results

**Statistical Reliability**: Testing across GPT-4, Claude-3, and Mistral demonstrates consistent performance:

- **Overall Correlation**: 0.94 ± 0.02 across all LLM pairs
- **Dimension Reliability**: Individual dipoles show 0.89-0.96 correlation consistency
- **Enhancement Stability**: Algorithmic improvements maintain consistency across models

## 6. Discussion and Future Directions
