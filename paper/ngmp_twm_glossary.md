# **Three Wells Model & NGMP Terminology Glossary**

*This glossary defines key terms for the Three Wells Model theoretical framework and Narrative Gravity Maps Platform (NGMP) methodological approach, ensuring precise terminology usage across the integrated research program.*

---

## **Three Wells Model: Core Concepts**

**Three Wells Model**: Analytical model explaining how contemporary political discourse is organized around three primary gravitational forces rather than traditional left-right ideological categories.

**Gravitational Wells**: The three fundamental attractive forces in political discourse that draw movements, policies, and rhetoric toward distinct visions of human nature and social organization: Intersectionality Theory, Tribal Domination Theory, and Pluralist Individual Dignity Theory.

**Gravitational Orientations**: How the three theories function as competing worldviews that orient political behavior and institutional design.

**Gravitational Dynamics**: Patterns of attraction, opposition, and institutional capture generated by the three gravitational wells in contemporary political systems.

---

## **The Three Theories**

**Intersectionality Theory**: Academic approach viewing individuals through multiple, overlapping identity categories shaped by systemic oppression, emphasizing group-based remedies and identity-conscious institutional design.

**Tribal Domination Theory**: Approach focused on in-group loyalty and out-group exclusion, where one group seeks to establish or maintain dominance over others within territories or institutions. Encompasses flexible tribal boundaries (ethnic, religious, ideological, professional).

**Pluralist Individual Dignity Theory**: Approach synthesizing liberal democratic principles by grounding individual autonomy and agency within dignified relationships, emphasizing universal human worth while enabling cooperation across difference.

---

## **Evaluative Concepts**

**Integrative-Disintegrative Analysis**: Assessment examining whether political approaches promote social cohesion and collective action capacity (integrative) or fragment communities and undermine democratic governance (disintegrative).

**Integrative Resilience**: Society's capacity to maintain stability and pursue collective flourishing while facing internal disagreements or external pressures through shared foundations for cooperation.

**Means-Ends Distinction**: Analytical separation between instrumental strategies (managerialism, economic populism) that can serve any gravitational orientation versus ultimate ends (the three fundamental theories that provide direction).

**Institutional Capture**: Process by which different gravitational orientations redirect existing institutions toward their ends rather than seeking to replace institutions entirely.

---

## **NGMP: Methodological Concepts**

**Narrative Gravity Maps Platform (NGMP)**: Universal quantitative methodology for mapping conceptual forces within persuasive texts across any analytical domain.

**Analytical Frameworks**: Configurable measurement architectures within NGMP that systematically analyze discourse positioning within any theoretical domain (e.g., Civic Virtue, Political Spectrum, Moral Foundations Theory).

**Framework-Agnostic Architecture**: Technical infrastructure supporting diverse analytical approaches through modular domain-specific implementations, enabling systematic measurement regardless of theoretical orientation.

## **Usage Guidelines**

### **Three Wells Model Terminology**

- **Use theory names** (Intersectionality Theory, Tribal Domination Theory, Pluralist Individual Dignity Theory) when discussing specific theoretical content
- **Use "gravitational wells"** when emphasizing their attractive force properties or in section headers  
- **Use "gravitational orientations"** when discussing how they function as competing worldviews

### **NGMP Terminology**

- **Use "analytical frameworks"** for NGMP measurement tools (reserved namespace)
- **Use "orientation-agnostic"** rather than "framework-agnostic" for technical architecture
- **Distinguish** between theoretical orientations (Three Wells) and measurement frameworks (NGMP)

### **Examples**

✓ "Intersectionality Theory emphasizes group-based solutions" (theory name)  
✓ "The first gravitational well attracts progressive movements" (attractive force)  
✓ "These gravitational orientations create different institutional designs" (worldview function)  
✓ "The Civic Virtue analytical framework measures moral positioning" (NGMP tool)

## **Integration Points**

**Empirical Validation**: The Three Wells Model can be empirically tested using NGMP analytical frameworks, enabling systematic measurement of discourse positioning within the three gravitational wells.

**Complementary Contributions**: 
- **Three Wells Model**: Theoretical innovation identifying fundamental gravitational forces in political discourse
- **NGMP**: Methodological advancement providing analytical frameworks for systematic measurement
- **Integrated Value**: Comprehensive research program combining theoretical insights with empirical validation tools
