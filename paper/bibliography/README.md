## Quick Reference: Most Relevant Resources

### üèÜ **Top Priority Corpora**

1. **CORPS** (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê) - Political speeches with audience reactions
   - Perfect for validating narrative gravity through audience response
   - Contact: FBK HLT-NLP team

2. **HKBU Corpus** (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê) - Multi-language political speeches
   - Ideal for cross-cultural framework validation
   - Access: [digital.lib.hkbu.edu.hk/corpus](https://digital.lib.hkbu.edu.hk/corpus)

3. **German Political Corpus** (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê) - 11M words, linguistically processed
   - Large-scale analysis and non-Anglo validation
   - Access: [Sketch Engine](https://sketchengine.eu/german-political-speeches-corpus)

### üìñ **Essential Methodology Papers**

- **Partington (2012)**: "Corpus Analysis of Political Language" - Foundation methods
- **Guerini et al. (2013)**: CORPS methodology - Audience reaction annotation
- **Climate Change Study**: Keyword analysis and semantic tagging techniques

## Research Integration Strategy

### **Immediate Actions** (Next 3 months)
1. Contact CORPS team for audience reaction correlation study
2. Access HKBU corpus for cross-cultural pilot analysis
3. Download German corpus sample for framework testing

### **Citation Strategy**
- Use `political_corpora_resources.bib` for formal academic citations
- Reference methodology papers to position narrative gravity within corpus linguistics
- Emphasize complementary value rather than replacement of existing approaches

### **Collaboration Opportunities**
- **Technical**: Share intelligent corpus ingestion methods
- **Data**: Contribute narrative gravity annotations to existing corpora
- **Research**: Joint studies on audience reaction prediction

## Usage Instructions

```latex
\bibliography{paper/bibliography/political_corpora_resources}
\cite{guerini_corps_2013}  % CORPS methodology
\cite{hkbu_political_speeches_corpus}  % Cross-cultural validation
```

### **For Grant Proposals**
- Reference strategic analysis for research agenda and collaboration plans
- Cite established corpus resources to demonstrate field integration
- Highlight technical innovations in corpus management

### **For Methodology Sections**
