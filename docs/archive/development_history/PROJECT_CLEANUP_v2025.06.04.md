# Project Cleanup Summary - v2025.06.04

## Overview

Comprehensive reorganization of the Narrative Gravity Maps project to eliminate scattered files and create a clean, maintainable structure.

## ✅ Cleanup Actions Completed

### 📁 Directory Organization

**Created new directories:**
- `docs/` - Centralized documentation
  - `docs/development/` - Technical development notes  
  - `docs/examples/` - Usage examples and quickstarts
  - `docs/archive/` - Reserved for future archived docs
- `archive/` - Historical/backup files
- `visualizations/` - Test visualization images
- `tests/` - Reserved for future test files

### 📄 File Reorganization

**Moved to `docs/development/`:**
- ROBUST_FRAMEWORK_NAMES.md
- FRAMEWORK_INJECTION_FIX.md  
- MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE.md
- STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md
- PROJECT_SNAPSHOT_v2.0.md
- VISUALIZATION_FIXES.md
- USER_STORIES.md
- DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md
- MODEL_NAME_FIX.md
- PROMPT_AND_FILENAME_IMPROVEMENTS.md
- UX_CLEANUP_OPTIONAL_TEXT.md
- CLI_JSON_FIXES.md
- IMPROVED_INTERFACE_NOTES.md
- TEST_SAMPLE_JSON.md

**Moved to `docs/examples/`:**
- STREAMLIT_QUICKSTART.md
- WORKFLOW_DEMO.md



**Moved to `archive/`:**
- model_output_backup_old_weights/ (entire directory)
- prompts/ → prompts_legacy/ (static prompt files no longer needed)
- visualizations/ → test_visualizations/ (development test images)

### 🗑️ System Cleanup

**Removed:**
- All .DS_Store files (macOS system files)
- Temporary files and clutter

### 📋 New Documentation

**Created:**
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Complete project organization documentation
- `docs/development/PROJECT_CLEANUP_v2025.06.04.md` - This cleanup summary

**Updated:**
- `.gitignore` - Enhanced to prevent future clutter accumulation
- `README.md` - Updated project structure section with clean organization

## 🎯 Results

### Before Cleanup
- 40+ files scattered in root directory
- Mixed documentation, code, and test files
- No clear organization principle
- Difficult to navigate and maintain

### After Cleanup  
- Clean separation of concerns
- Logical directory structure
- Easy navigation and maintenance
- Clear development workflow

### Root Directory (Clean)
```
narrative_gravity_analysis/
├── 🚀 Core Application (5 files)
├── 📊 Data & Config (6 directories)  
├── 📚 Documentation (3 items)
├── 🗃️ Archive & Tests (3 directories)
└── 📋 Project Files (3 files)
```

## ✅ Verification

**Framework functionality:** ✅ All frameworks still work correctly
**Application launch:** ✅ Streamlit app launches without issues  
**Documentation access:** ✅ All docs properly organized and accessible
**Git status:** ✅ Clean working directory with enhanced .gitignore

## 🔄 Maintenance Guidelines

### Future Development
1. **Core files:** Keep application logic in root directory
2. **Documentation:** Add new docs to appropriate `docs/` subdirectory
3. **Test files:** Use `tests/` directory for formal tests
4. **Archive:** Move old/deprecated files to `archive/`

### Prevention
- Enhanced `.gitignore` prevents common clutter files
- Clear naming conventions documented in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`
- Regular cleanup recommended every major version

## 📈 Benefits

1. **Developer Experience:** Faster navigation and file location
2. **Maintainability:** Clear separation of application vs. documentation
3. **Collaboration:** New contributors can easily understand structure
4. **Professional Appearance:** Clean, organized codebase
5. **Scalability:** Structure supports future growth and complexity

This cleanup establishes a solid foundation for continued development and research use of the Narrative Gravity Maps methodology.
