# Deprecated Interface Development Documentation

## Strategic Context
These documents were archived on June 11, 2025, following the strategic pivot from conversational interface development to validation-first research platform outlined in `docs/development/planning/on_deck/strategic_pivot.md`.

## Archive Date: June 11, 2025

## Reason for Archival
The strategic pivot document explicitly states:
- Pause all conversational interface development
- Stop complex interface development
- Redirect resources to CLI tool enhancement and academic validation

## Archived Documents

### Development Requirements (Deprecated)
- `CHATBOT_RESEARCH_WORKBENCH_SPECIFICATION.md` - Detailed specification for conversational interface development
- `LLM_VALIDATION_WORKBENCH_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Requirements document focused on complex interface features

### User Guides (Deprecated)
- `CHAINLIT_INTERFACE_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of Chainlit interface implementation
- `CHAINLIT_USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Usage guide for Chainlit interface
- `CHATBOT_USAGE.md` - General chatbot usage instructions
- `VALIDATION_WORKBENCH_GUIDE.md` - Guide for interface-based validation workbench

### Planning Documents (Deprecated)
- `conversational_interface/` folder - All conversational interface architecture and requirements
- `futures/conversational_interface/` - Future planning for conversational interfaces

These documents represent sophisticated work that may be valuable for future reference but are not aligned with the current validation-first development strategy.

## Current Strategic Focus
The project now prioritizes:
1. Structured manual component development
2. CLI-based analysis orchestration  
3. Academic tool integration
4. Systematic validation infrastructure

Interface development has been explicitly deprioritized in favor of validation studies and academic publication preparation.
