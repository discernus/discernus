### üìÅ Data Locations

**Reports (Human-readable):** `discernus/librarian/reports/`
- 10 new markdown reports (64-79KB each, 780-1,000+ lines each)
- All reports include confidence levels and evidence-based recommendations

**Research Data (Machine-readable):** `discernus/librarian/research_data/`
- 10 corresponding JSON files with full research data structure
- Each includes: question, research_plan, synthesis, critique, final_response, process_metrics

### üéØ Research Quality Standards Met

- **Mature Democracies Scope:** All studies explicitly constrained to established, high-functioning democracies
- **Quantitative Focus:** Each study sought effect sizes, comparative analyses, and validated weighting schemes
- **Evidence-Based Confidence:** All reports include confidence classifications (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with numerical scores)
- **Framework Coverage:** Complete coverage of all analytical axes from CFF v4.2 and ECF v1.0
- **Academic Rigor:** Multi-stage validation with red team critique and peer-reviewed literature focus

## Your Mission: Meta-Analysis and Archival

### üéØ Primary Objectives

#### 1. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis
**Target File:** `docs/research/framework_weight_validation/meta_analysis/triple_weighting_meta_analysis.md`

**Tasks:**
- Read and synthesize findings from all 10 new research reports
- Extract confidence levels and evidence strength for each axis
- Identify patterns across Social Health vs Strategic Effectiveness dimensions
- Update the "Ethical Tension" analysis with new evidence
- Create evidence-based weighting recommendations for production frameworks
- Generate confidence assessment table for all axes

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- What are the confidence levels for each axis weighting scheme?
- Where do Social Health and Strategic Effectiveness align or conflict?
- What does the evidence say about the "ethical tension" hypothesis?
- Which axes have ESTABLISHED vs PROVISIONAL vs SPECULATIVE evidence?
- What are the final recommendations for CFF v4.2 and ECF v1.0 production weights?

#### 2. Research Archival and Organization
**Tasks:**
- Archive older research reports (pre-July 21 studies) to `discernus/librarian/archives/2025-01/`
- Organize the 10 new studies by research domain (Social Health vs Strategic Effectiveness)
- Create summary index of all completed framework weight research
- Update the master research inventory

### üìã Execution Guidelines

#### Meta-Analysis Methodology
1. **Evidence Synthesis:** For each axis, synthesize findings from both Social Health and Strategic Effectiveness studies
2. **Confidence Assessment:** Use the evidence-based confidence system (HIGH 7-10, MEDIUM 4-6, LOW 1-3)
3. **Cross-Study Validation:** Look for consistency patterns across the 10 studies
4. **Ethical Tension Analysis:** Determine if Social Health and Strategic Effectiveness recommendations conflict
5. **Production Recommendations:** Translate research findings into actionable framework weights

#### Key Frameworks to Reference
- **CFF v4.2:** `frameworks/reference/flagship/Cohesive Flourishing Framework (CFF) v4.2.md`
- **ECF v1.0:** `frameworks/reference/core/ecf_v1.0_refined.md`
- **Triple Weighting Analysis:** `docs/research/framework_enhancement_2025_01_20/analysis/triple_weighting_framework_analysis.md`

- [ ] Preserved provenance for all archived materials

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

#### Research Context
- This research addresses the "devastating insight" from triple weighting analysis: potential conflict between political effectiveness and social health
- The studies test whether ethical communication is actually more effective than manipulative communication
- All research is scoped to mature democracies to isolate effects from confounding variables

#### Technical Context
- All reports generated using `DiscernusLibrarian` with consistent methodology
- Each report includes multi-stage validation (initial research + counter-research + completeness check)
- Red team critique provides adversarial quality control
- Confidence levels are evidence-based, not subjective

#### Framework Integration
- Results must inform weighting schemes for both CFF v4.2 (10 anchors) and ECF v1.0 (6 dimensions)
- Focus on practical implementation for production analysis workflows
- Consider both static weights and dynamic weighting possibilities
