# Framework Weight Research Data Format
## Systematic Literature Validity Assessment Protocol

**Purpose**: Enable systematic falsification of the hypothesis that sufficient literature consensus exists for framework static weights.

**Storage Location**: `docs/research/framework_weight_validation/`

**Critical Requirement**: All research findings must be stored in structured format enabling meta-analysis and falsification.

## Falsification Criteria Framework

### **Dual Hypotheses to Test**
**Social Health Hypothesis**: *"There exists sufficient literature consensus to justify Social Health weight assignments (normative analysis) in framework triple weighting systems."*

**Strategic Effectiveness Hypothesis**: *"There exists sufficient literature consensus to justify Strategic Effectiveness weight assignments (pragmatic analysis) in framework triple weighting systems."*

**Ethical Tension Hypothesis**: *"Strategic Effectiveness optimal weights conflict with Social Health optimal weights, creating ethical tensions between political success and social wellbeing."*

### **Literature Consensus Classification**

**ðŸŸ¢ ESTABLISHED** (High Confidence):
- 5+ high-quality peer-reviewed studies
- Consistent findings across multiple methodologies  
- Large sample sizes (>1000 total participants)
- Effect sizes documented with confidence intervals
- Replication across different populations/contexts

**ðŸŸ¡ PROVISIONAL** (Medium Confidence):
- 2-4 peer-reviewed studies supporting claim
- Some methodological variation but consistent direction
- Moderate sample sizes (100-1000 total participants)
- Some effect sizes available, limited replication
- Theoretical foundation with partial empirical support

**ðŸŸ  SPECULATIVE** (Low Confidence):
- 1-2 studies or primarily theoretical reasoning
- Limited empirical support or mixed findings
- Small sample sizes (<100) or convenience samples
- No effect sizes or weight-specific guidance
- Theoretical appeal but insufficient validation

**ðŸ”´ UNKNOWN** (No Research Basis):
- No relevant studies found
- Research exists but on different constructs
- Weight assignments appear convenience-based
- No theoretical or empirical justification
- Pure assumption or convention

### **Falsification Thresholds**

**Social Health Research Domain**:
- **SUPPORTED** if â‰¥60% of Social Health weights achieve ðŸŸ¢ or ðŸŸ¡ status
- **FALSIFIED** if <40% achieve ðŸŸ¢ or ðŸŸ¡ status  
- **MIXED EVIDENCE** if 40-60% achieve sufficient support

**Strategic Effectiveness Research Domain**:
- **SUPPORTED** if â‰¥60% of Strategic Effectiveness weights achieve ðŸŸ¢ or ðŸŸ¡ status
- **FALSIFIED** if <40% achieve ðŸŸ¢ or ðŸŸ¡ status
- **MIXED EVIDENCE** if 40-60% achieve sufficient support

**Ethical Tension Analysis**:
- **HIGH CONFLICT** if Social Health and Strategic Effectiveness recommend opposite weight patterns (e.g., Hope vs Fear emphasis)
- **MODERATE CONFLICT** if weight recommendations differ significantly but same direction
- **LOW CONFLICT** if weight patterns align but with different magnitudes
- **NO CONFLICT** if both domains recommend similar weight patterns

## Meta-Analysis Protocol

### **Cross-Framework Validity Assessment**

After completing all research questions, aggregate analysis examining:

1. **Framework Validity Patterns**: Which frameworks have strongest research foundations?
2. **Dimension Type Patterns**: Which types of dimensions (emotional, relational, identity) have best research support?
3. **Weight Assignment Patterns**: Are equal weights vs. hierarchical weights vs. specific ratios better supported?
4. **Research Gap Patterns**: What systematic research needs emerge?

### **Dual-Domain Systematic Comparison Matrix**

### **Quality Assurance**
- Each research question requires independent DiscernusLibrarian session
- Cross-validation through different search strategies  
- Explicit confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification
- Complete citation and methodology transparency

**Strategic Value**: This systematic approach enables definitive falsification of literature consensus assumptions while identifying specific research needs for strengthening framework validity.
