# Platform Architecture Overview
*Discernus Core System Design*

## Architecture Philosophy

### Framework-Agnostic Multi-Model Ensemble Architecture

Discernus enables researchers to submit complex analysis tasks with any systematic framework through a simple interface, leverage ensemble model capabilities for comprehensive validation, utilize structured debate protocols for divergence resolution with evidence-based arbitration, and receive publication-ready results with complete methodology documentation.

**Core Innovation**: Framework-agnostic multi-model ensemble analysis with structured debate protocols that transform LLM disagreement into analytical validation strength rather than uncertainty.

### Human-Centric Design Philosophy

Discernus emphasizes human expertise in framework specification and validation rather than runtime intervention. The system helps researchers create rigorous framework definitions upfront, then executes analysis autonomously with full transparency and auditability.

**Success Metric**: If researchers say "This feels like working with a really smart colleague," we have succeeded in amplifying human intelligence through computational assistance.

## Three Foundational Architectural Requirements

### Mathematical Reliability
**Critical Foundation**: LLMs cannot be trusted for calculations—fatal flaws for statistical analysis. Every component implements the hybrid intelligence pattern: LLM designs analytical approach → secure code executor performs calculations → LLM interprets results in natural language. The secure code executor provides both computational reliability and complete calculation transparency for reproducibility.

### Cost Transparency  
**Institutional Adoption Enabler**: Every architectural component provides upfront cost estimation, budget controls, and intelligent model selection to ensure predictable pricing for academic and organizational adoption.

### Complete Reproducibility
**Zero Mystery Commitment**: Every architectural component maintains complete audit trails, decision documentation, and provenance chains that enable independent researchers to achieve deterministically identical results and defend their work under academic scrutiny. This includes full calculation transparency with complete visibility into all mathematical operations, parameters, and computational procedures.

## Core Components

### Agent Registry
**Dynamic Agent Discovery and Orchestration**
- **Centralized agent catalog**: YAML-based registry of all available analytical capabilities
- **Agent archetypes**: Classification system for different types of analytical intelligence
- **Dynamic capability matching**: Automatic selection of appropriate agents for specific tasks
- **Execution method standardization**: Consistent interfaces for spawning and coordinating agents

The agent registry enables a modular ecosystem where new analytical capabilities can be registered and discovered without requiring core system modifications.

### Model Registry
**Intelligent Model Selection and Fallback**
- **Multi-provider abstraction**: Unified interface across different LLM providers
- **Cost-aware routing**: Intelligent selection based on task requirements and budget constraints
- **Performance-based fallback**: Automatic degradation to alternative models when primary fails
- **Rate limiting and quota management**: Ensures system stability and cost predictability

**Foundational Requirements Integration**:
- **Cost Transparency**: Provides upfront cost estimation for every model selection and maintains complete spending tracking
- **Complete Reproducibility**: Logs every model selection decision, version, and configuration for deterministic replication
- **Mathematical Reliability**: Ensures consistent model access for hybrid intelligence workflows

The model registry provides researchers with transparent access to the best available models while maintaining cost control, operational reliability, and complete audit trails.

### Orchestration Engine
**Ensemble Coordination and Validation**

#### Revolutionary Architecture Shift
**From Sequential to Ensemble**: Deploy 4-6 complete framework analyses with systematic cross-validation rather than spawning dozens of specialized agents.

**Modern Context Utilization**: 1M+ token models enable complete framework analysis per model with full framework specifications + reference materials within single context.

#### Structured Validation Protocol
- **Ensemble disagreement as strength**: Systematic debate protocols convert model divergence into methodological rigor
- **Evidence-based arbitration**: Referee agents make final decisions based on textual evidence quality
- **Complete audit trail**: JSON chronolog provides full methodology transparency

### Extension Ecosystem
**Drupal-Style Module Architecture**

#### Core Platform (Controlled)
- **Agent orchestration**: Dynamic discovery and coordination of analytical capabilities
- **Model management**: Intelligent selection, routing, and fallback mechanisms
- **Security and provenance**: Complete audit trail and access control systems
- **Basic analytical workflows**: Foundation patterns for framework-agnostic analysis

#### Extension Modules (Open)
- **Domain-specific frameworks**: Political analysis, literary criticism, corporate communication
- **Custom analysis agents**: Specialized analytical capabilities for specific use cases
- **Visualization tools**: Interactive dashboards and reporting interfaces
- **Integration adapters**: Connectors for external data sources and systems

This architecture enables a thriving ecosystem of extensions while maintaining core platform stability and reliability.

## THIN Architecture Principles

### LLM Intelligence + Minimal Software
**Core Philosophy**: "Thick LLM + Thin Software = Epistemic Trust"

#### What LLMs Do (Intelligence)
- **Framework application**: Apply analytical frameworks to textual content
- **Evidence synthesis**: Combine multiple sources into coherent arguments
- **Adversarial reasoning**: Challenge and defend analytical positions
- **Natural language interpretation**: Convert complex analysis into human-readable insights

#### What Software Does (Infrastructure)
- **Routing and orchestration**: Coordinate multiple LLM interactions
- **Secure code execution**: Perform mathematical operations with reliability
- **Data storage and versioning**: Maintain complete analytical provenance
- **Access control and security**: Ensure safe and auditable operations

### Natural Language Flow
- **Minimal parsing requirements**: LLMs communicate through natural language, not complex JSON structures
- **Centralized prompt management**: All LLM instructions stored in `discernus/core/llm_roles.py`
- **Conversational interfaces**: Researchers interact through natural dialogue, not technical configurations

### Mathematical Reliability
**Critical Foundation**: LLMs cannot be trusted for calculations—fatal flaws for statistical analysis.

**Hybrid Intelligence Pattern**:
1. **LLM Design Phase**: Framework application and analytical approach
2. **Secure Execution Phase**: Mathematical operations through `secure_code_executor.py`
3. **LLM Interpretation Phase**: Results synthesis and natural language explanation

This ensures mathematical consistency while preserving human-readable analytical insights.

## Adversarial Review Process

### Academic Innovation: AI-Powered Peer Review

#### Traditional Peer Review Limitations
- **Human cognitive load**: Reviewers overwhelmed by complex framework application
- **Inconsistency**: Variable human judgment across different texts and timeframes
- **Scale constraints**: Manual review infeasible for large-scale computational research
- **Bias introduction**: Reviewer preferences influence synthesis decisions

#### Discernus Adversarial Review Innovation
- **Systematic evidence competition**: Multiple AI models defend analyses with textual citations
- **Structured challenge protocols**: Formal debate processes requiring framework alignment
- **Evidence-based arbitration**: Referee models evaluate argument quality
- **Complete methodology transparency**: Full debate transcripts provide academic auditability
- **Scalable academic rigor**: Consistent quality assurance across unlimited corpus sizes

### Evidence-Based Validation Example
```
Traditional: "This text scores 1.7 on populist dimension" (black box)
Discernus: "Model A scored 1.7 citing X, Y, Z evidence. Model B challenged with 
           counter-evidence A, B, C. Referee selected Model A's argument based on 
           stronger framework alignment. Full debate transcript available."
```
