## 🎯 **MVP Paper Strategy**

### Current Priority: Moral Foundations Theory Validation
**Academic Strategy**: Establish credibility through systematic MFT implementation validation before expanding to additional frameworks

#### Phase Structure
1. **MFT Implementation** (Weeks 1-4): Build working system with preliminary validation
2. **Expert Consultation** (Weeks 5-8): Haidt lab outreach with demonstration + evidence
3. **Validation Execution** (Weeks 9-12): Large-scale study (n=500, r>0.8 target with MFQ-30)
4. **Publication Preparation** (Months 4-6): Paper completion with expert co-authorship

#### Success Criteria
- **Statistical Validation**: r>0.8 correlation with MFQ-30 across all foundations
- **Expert Endorsement**: Formal collaboration with Jonathan Haidt lab
- **Academic Publication**: Co-authored methodology paper acceptance
- **Community Adoption**: Computational social science researcher platform usage

## 🔗 **Integration with Platform Development**

### Aligned Strategy
The paper development directly supports the Discernus MVP platform strategy:

- **Platform Development**: [`../project-management/planning/active/CURRENT_ITERATION_DISCERNUS_MVP.md`](../project-management/planning/active/CURRENT_ITERATION_DISCERNUS_MVP.md)
- **User Journeys**: [`../planning/discernus_mvp_user_journeys.md`](../planning/discernus_mvp_user_journeys.md)
- **Software Platform Plan**: [`../planning/software_platform_restructuring_plan_option4.md`](../planning/software_platform_restructuring_plan_option4.md)

### Synchronized Timeline
- **Week 1-4**: Platform MFT implementation + Paper planning
- **Week 5-8**: Expert consultation + Methodology refinement  
- **Week 9-12**: Validation execution + Paper drafting
- **Month 4-6**: Platform launch + Paper submission

---

## 📈 **Academic Positioning**

### Target Venues
- **Primary**: Computational Social Science journals
- **Secondary**: Political Psychology, Political Communication
- **Considerations**: Open science emphasis, methodological contribution focus

### Methodological Contribution
- **Systematic Framework Validation**: Rigorous protocols for computational framework implementation
- **Expert Consultation Integration**: Academic collaboration workflows for platform development
- **Statistical Validation Standards**: Correlation targets and validation criteria for framework accuracy
- **Reproducible Research Infrastructure**: Complete replication packages and transparent methodology

### Community Impact
- **Computational Social Scientists**: Validated tools for systematic framework analysis
- **Framework Researchers**: Infrastructure for empirical framework testing and refinement
- **Open Science Community**: Transparent, reproducible methodology and platform development
- **Academic Institutions**: Research-grade infrastructure for collaborative discourse analysis

## 🚨 **Archive Notice: Narrative Gravity Drafts**

### Historical Context
The `archive/narrative_gravity_drafts/` folder contains previous theoretical paper versions focusing on novel framework development. These drafts represent the pre-pivot approach emphasizing:

- Three Wells Model theoretical contribution
- Gravitational metaphor and coordinate systems
- Framework-agnostic universal methodology claims
- Normative political advocacy integration

### Strategic Decision
These approaches were **archived** (not deleted) following comprehensive expert feedback indicating:
- Theoretical claims required extensive validation beyond MVP scope
- Gravitational metaphor created false precision without empirical grounding
- Framework-agnostic claims conflicted with methodological requirements
- Academic publication probability higher with methodology focus

### Preservation Rationale
Archives preserved for:
- Historical development record
- Potential future theoretical paper development
- Reference for methodology paper context
- Institutional memory of exploration process
