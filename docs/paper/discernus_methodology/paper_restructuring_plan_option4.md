# Discernus Methodology Paper Restructuring Plan (Option 4)
**Discernus as Methodological Infrastructure**

*Date: June 2025*  
*Status: Comprehensive Restructuring Plan*  
*Strategic Approach: Option 4 - Discernus with Established Frameworks*

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete restructuring of the current integrated Three Wells Model (TWM) and Discernus platform paper into a focused methodology paper that positions Discernus as experimental infrastructure for systematic text analysis using established academic frameworks. The restructuring eliminates novel theoretical claims in favor of rigorous methodological contribution using three well-documented frameworks: Moral Foundations Theory, Political Framing Theory, and Cultural Theory.

**Core Transformation**: From theoretical discovery to methodological infrastructure  
**Primary Goal**: Establish Discernus as credible computational tool for systematic framework comparison  
**Success Criteria**: Platform validation, community adoption, methodological contribution to computational social science

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Paper Structure Issues
The current draft suffers from several fundamental problems identified in expert reviews:

**Conceptual Confusion**:
- Mixed theoretical discovery with methodological development
- "Gravity wells" metaphor creates false precision without measurable forces
- Framework-agnostic claims while making normative commitments
- Definitions are loose and empirically untested

**Structural Problems**:
- Simultaneous defense of novel theory AND computational methodology
- Normative advocacy disguised as neutral analysis
- Lack of systematic validation against established measures
- Insufficient empirical grounding for theoretical claims

**Methodological Weaknesses**:
- No systematic comparison with existing analytical approaches
- Quality assurance focused on consistency rather than validity
- Validation procedures lack theoretical sophistication
- Over-promises on "universal quantitative methodology"

### What Must Be Eliminated
1. **All Three Wells Model theoretical content** - moved to separate future paper
2. **Gravitational metaphor and physics analogies** - replaced with neutral terminology
3. **Framework-agnostic claims** - replaced with explicit theoretical dependence
4. **Normative advocacy** - eliminated entirely from methodology paper
5. **Universal methodology claims** - replaced with domain-specific validation

### What Must Be Added
1. **Established framework implementations** - detailed operationalization of three frameworks
2. **Systematic validation studies** - rigorous comparison with existing measures
3. **Expert consultation process** - collaboration with framework originators
4. **Methodological contribution claims** - clear value proposition for computational social science
5. **Honest limitation acknowledgment** - explicit scope conditions and boundaries
