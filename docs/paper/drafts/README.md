## Relationship to Three Wells Model Paper

This paper focuses on the **methodology** for analyzing narrative positioning, while the Three Wells Model paper focuses on a **specific theoretical framework** for contemporary political discourse. They are complementary works that can be developed in parallel:

- **NGM Paper**: Universal methodology applicable across domains
- **TWM Paper**: Specific application to political discourse analysis
- **Shared Foundation**: Both use the same underlying mathematical framework

## Current Priorities

1. **Experimental Validation**: Complete systematic experimental validation across all five frameworks
2. **Human-LLM Comparison**: Conduct human-LLM comparison studies for each framework implementation
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Generate publication-ready experimental results visualizations
4. **Replication Materials**: Develop comprehensive experimental replication packages
