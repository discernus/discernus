### Evidence Status
- ✅ Universal methodology validation across 5 diverse example frameworks
- ✅ Framework-agnostic technical implementation confirmed  
- ✅ Cross-domain applicability demonstrated through diverse configurations
- ❌ Domain-specific human validation required for each framework application
- ❌ Cross-domain validation studies needed for universal claims

### Academic Impact Strategy
- **Broader Adoption**: Any researcher can see methodology applicability to their domain
- **Cross-Disciplinary Citation**: Universal methodology enables citation across multiple fields
- **Community Growth**: Framework contribution pathway for researchers in any domain
- **Methodological Innovation**: Focus on universal computational methodology rather than domain-specific applications

## [v1.0.1] - 2025-06-10

### Added
Fixed all validation overclaims in paper content - changed 'empirical validation' to 'technical implementation' throughout, removed inappropriate claims about human moral perception validation, updated validation checker to be more nuanced about appropriate vs inappropriate claims

### Evidence Status
- Technical validation: ✅ Available
- Case studies: ✅ Available  
- Human validation: ❌ Required for publication


### Planned
- Human validation studies section (v1.1.0)
- Cross-cultural validation analysis (v1.1.0)
- Expert annotation comparison results (v1.1.0)
- Expanded literature review incorporating human-LLM alignment research (v1.1.0)

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-06

### Added
- **MAJOR CORRECTION**: Honest validation status assessment replacing overclaims
- Critical limitations section (6.1) addressing human alignment gap
- Clear distinction between technical consistency and empirical validation
- Required validation studies specification
- Appropriate current applications and limitations
- Future research priorities focused on human validation
- Literature review integration acknowledging LLM limitations

### Changed
- **Abstract**: Removed "empirical validation" claims, added human validation caveat
- **Introduction**: Clarified methodology as computational tool requiring validation
- **Keywords**: Changed from "empirical validation" to "computational consistency"
- **Section 6.1**: Complete rewrite addressing validation limitations honestly
- **Conclusion**: Honest assessment of current capabilities and limitations
- **Tone**: From definitive claims to appropriate academic caution

### Removed
- Overclaims about "production-ready status" for human moral perception
- Assertions that cross-LLM consistency equals empirical validation
- Inappropriate confidence about capturing human moral judgment

### Fixed
- Validation methodology confusion (technical vs. empirical)
- Overclaims about framework's relationship to human perception
- Missing acknowledgment of LLM limitations from recent research

### Evidence Status
- ✅ Technical implementation validation documented
- ✅ Cross-LLM consistency data (r > 0.90) properly contextualized
- ✅ Case study analyses included with appropriate caveats
- ❌ Human validation studies - acknowledged as critical gap
- ❌ Expert annotation studies - identified as required next step

## [0.9.0] - 2025-01-05 (Historical Reconstruction)

### Added (Before Validation Correction)
- Complete mathematical framework documentation
- Civic Virtue Framework implementation details
- Case study analyses (Trump, Obama, Biden inaugural addresses)
- Cross-LLM reliability testing results
- Enhanced metrics formulation (COM, NPS, DPS)
- Differential weighting system theoretical justification

### Known Issues (Corrected in v1.0.0)
- Overclaimed "empirical validation" without human studies
- Conflated technical consistency with human alignment
- Insufficient acknowledgment of LLM limitations
- Missing critical literature review on human-LLM alignment
