# Narrative Gravity Maps: A Universal Quantitative Framework for Analyzing Persuasive Discourse

**Version 1.2.0 - Framework-Agnostic Universal Methodology**

## Abstract

Persuasive discourse across all domains—from political rhetoric to business communication, educational content to healthcare messaging—shapes human behavior and institutional outcomes. This paper introduces **Narrative Gravity Maps**, a universal quantitative methodology for mapping and analyzing the conceptual forces that drive persuasive narrative formation across any analytical domain. The methodology positions configurable "gravity wells" on a circular coordinate system, enabling systematic measurement of narrative positioning and trajectory with universal tool compatibility and intuitive interpretation.

The framework-agnostic architecture supports diverse analytical approaches through modular domain-specific implementations. We demonstrate this versatility through five example frameworks: **Civic Virtue** (political discourse analysis), **Political Spectrum** (ideological positioning), **Moral Foundations Theory** (cross-cultural analysis), **Identity Recognition** (identity dynamics), and **Rhetorical Posture** (communication styles). **Technical implementation demonstrates cross-model consistency with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.90 across multiple LLM platforms, though validation against human judgment remains a critical area for future research.**

**The circular coordinate architecture enables framework developers to independently control positional arrangement (visual rhetoric), mathematical weighting (analytical power), and algorithmic enhancement (technical sophistication), supporting both normative analytical approaches and descriptive research frameworks.** Case studies across multiple domains demonstrate the methodology's capacity for quantitative differentiation between contrasting discourse approaches, with radial distance metrics providing precise measurement of computational positioning within any conceptual framework.

Unlike purely descriptive approaches, Narrative Gravity Maps can accommodate explicit normative distinctions while maintaining technical consistency and computational reproducibility across domains. The methodology provides a systematic computational tool for analyzing how persuasive narratives position themselves along researcher-specified dimensions, though validation against human perception requires further research across each application domain.

## 1. Introduction

Persuasive discourse shapes human behavior and institutional outcomes across all domains of human interaction. From political rhetoric that influences democratic governance, to business communication that drives market behavior, to educational content that shapes learning outcomes, to healthcare messaging that affects patient decisions—the ability to systematically analyze persuasive narratives has broad implications for research and practice.

Contemporary analysis of persuasive discourse faces significant methodological limitations. Most approaches are either purely descriptive, avoiding normative distinctions that researchers and practitioners need, or domain-specific, limiting their applicability across different fields of inquiry. Researchers lack systematic tools for quantitatively mapping the conceptual forces that drive narrative formation in their specific domains while maintaining consistency with broader analytical frameworks.

This paper introduces **Narrative Gravity Maps**, a universal quantitative methodology for mapping and analyzing the forces that drive persuasive narrative formation across any analytical domain. The methodology positions configurable "gravity wells" on a circular coordinate system, enabling systematic measurement of narrative positioning and trajectory. The framework-agnostic architecture supports diverse theoretical commitments through modular implementations, accommodating both normative analytical approaches and descriptive research frameworks.

**Version 1.2.0 establishes framework agnosticism as a core principle**, demonstrating how a single methodology can support analysis across multiple domains while maintaining mathematical consistency and computational reproducibility. This design enables researchers to develop domain-specific frameworks (political discourse, business communication, educational content, healthcare messaging, etc.) using consistent technical infrastructure while preserving theoretical flexibility appropriate to their field.

We demonstrate this methodology through five example frameworks spanning different analytical domains, with particular emphasis on the **Civic Virtue Framework** as our most advanced implementation for political discourse analysis. However, the methodology's power lies in its universal applicability, not in any specific domain implementation.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations and Universal Methodology

### 2.1 The Need for Universal Discourse Analysis Tools

Persuasive discourse analysis has traditionally been fragmented across disciplines, with each field developing isolated approaches that limit cross-domain learning and comparative analysis. Political scientists analyze campaign rhetoric, business researchers study organizational communication, educators examine pedagogical discourse, and healthcare professionals investigate patient communication—often using incompatible methodological frameworks.

This fragmentation prevents researchers from leveraging analytical insights across domains and limits the development of general principles for understanding persuasive communication. A universal methodology that maintains mathematical consistency while supporting domain-specific theoretical commitments could advance research across multiple fields simultaneously.

### 2.2 Existing Approaches and Their Limitations

Current approaches to discourse analysis fall into several categories, each with significant limitations:

**Domain-Specific Frameworks** provide rich context for particular fields but lack transferability. Political discourse analysis tools cannot be applied to business communication; educational content analysis frameworks don't work for healthcare messaging.

**Purely Descriptive Approaches** avoid normative judgments but limit practical utility. Researchers and practitioners often need to distinguish between more and less effective, ethical, or constructive forms of persuasive discourse within their domain.

**Technical Approaches** focus on computational methods but lack theoretical grounding appropriate to specific domains. Natural language processing tools provide statistical analysis but cannot capture domain-specific conceptual frameworks.

### 2.3 Framework-Agnostic Design Requirements

A universal methodology for persuasive discourse analysis requires several key capabilities:

**Domain Flexibility**: Support for any conceptual framework through configurable analytical components, enabling researchers to define domain-appropriate "gravity wells" and positioning strategies.

**Theoretical Neutrality**: No assumptions about which analytical approaches are superior, accommodating both normative frameworks that make value distinctions and descriptive frameworks that avoid such judgments.

**Mathematical Consistency**: Identical computational procedures across all domain implementations, ensuring reproducibility and enabling cross-domain comparison when appropriate.

**Tool Compatibility**: Universal compatibility with standard academic software (R, Python, Stata) and visualization platforms, avoiding domain-specific technical requirements.

## 3. Narrative Gravity Maps: Universal Methodology

### 3.1 Core Methodological Framework

Narrative Gravity Maps provide a universal quantitative methodology for mapping conceptual forces within persuasive texts across any analytical domain. The core innovation lies in positioning configurable "gravity wells" on a circular coordinate system, where each well represents a distinct conceptual orientation that exerts attractive force proportional to a narrative's alignment with that orientation.

**Framework-Agnostic Architecture**: The methodology makes no assumptions about the meaning, number, or arrangement of gravity wells. Researchers define domain-specific frameworks through simple configuration files specifying:
- Well names and conceptual definitions
- Angular positioning and clustering strategies  
- Weighting schemes and mathematical relationships
- Visualization preferences and theoretical commitments

**Circular Coordinate System**: Version 1.2.0 uses standard circular coordinates that maximize researcher adoption while preserving analytical sophistication. Unlike specialized coordinate systems that require domain-specific mathematical knowledge, circular positioning uses standard polar coordinates familiar to all researchers, ensuring universal tool compatibility across academic platforms.

### 3.2 Three Independent Design Dimensions

A key architectural innovation distinguishing Narrative Gravity Maps from simpler analytical approaches is the separation of three independent design dimensions, each controlled by framework developers:

#### 3.2.1 Positional Arrangement (Visual Rhetoric)

Framework developers control the angular positioning of wells on the circular boundary to reflect their theoretical commitments and domain-specific requirements:

**Normative Arrangements**: Position preferred conceptual orientations in visually prominent locations (e.g., upper hemisphere) to reinforce analytical distinctions.

**Descriptive Arrangements**: Use neutral, balanced positioning that avoids visual implications of superiority or preference among conceptual orientations.

**Domain-Specific Arrangements**: Any positioning scheme supported by theoretical justification appropriate to the analytical domain (political left-right, business trust-skepticism, educational growth-limitation, etc.).

#### 3.2.2 Mathematical Weighting (Analytical Power)

Independent of positional arrangement, frameworks assign numerical weights to wells based on theoretical importance within their domain:

**Hierarchical Weighting**: Different tiers of importance reflecting research findings about differential influence within the domain.

**Equal Weighting**: All dimensions weighted equally when theoretical commitments assume equivalent importance.

**Custom Weighting**: Any numerical scheme justified by empirical evidence or theoretical argument appropriate to the domain.

#### 3.2.3 Algorithmic Enhancement (Technical Sophistication)

Mathematical algorithms for processing raw scores remain consistent across all frameworks while enabling sophisticated analysis:

**Dominance Amplification**: Exponential enhancement of extreme scores to ensure genuine extremes reach visualization boundaries.

**Adaptive Scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on narrative extremeness, utilizing more boundary space for truly extreme cases.

**Boundary Snapping**: Gentle adjustment toward boundaries for narratives demonstrating clear dominance patterns.

These enhancements work identically regardless of framework positioning or weighting choices, ensuring technical consistency while preserving theoretical flexibility across all domains.

### 3.3 Domain Implementation Examples

#### 3.3.1 Political Discourse Analysis (Civic Virtue Framework)

**Domain**: Political discourse analysis with normative commitments
**Approach**: Positions civic virtues (Dignity, Justice, Truth) in upper hemisphere, problematic forces (Tribalism, Resentment, Manipulation) in lower hemisphere
**Weighting**: Hierarchical based on moral psychology research
**Applications**: Campaign rhetoric, policy debates, institutional communication

#### 3.3.2 Business Communication Analysis (Trust Framework)

**Domain**: Organizational and commercial communication analysis
**Approach**: Positions trust-building forces vs. trust-eroding forces with domain-specific clustering
**Weighting**: Based on business communication research and stakeholder theory
**Applications**: Corporate messaging, marketing communication, crisis management

#### 3.3.3 Educational Discourse Analysis (Growth Framework)

**Domain**: Pedagogical communication and learning discourse
**Approach**: Positions growth-oriented vs. limitation-oriented communication patterns
**Weighting**: Based on educational psychology and pedagogical research
**Applications**: Curriculum design, instructional communication, educational policy

#### 3.3.4 Healthcare Communication Analysis (Healing Framework)

**Domain**: Patient-provider communication and health messaging
**Approach**: Positions healing-supportive vs. healing-impeding communication patterns
**Weighting**: Based on medical communication research and patient outcomes
**Applications**: Clinical communication, health education, medical policy

### 3.4 Cross-Domain Validation Strategy

**Mathematical Consistency**: Core algorithms produce identical computational behavior across all framework implementations, ensuring reproducibility and enabling methodological validation.

**Domain-Specific Validation**: Each framework requires validation against domain-appropriate standards and expert judgment within its field.

**Cross-Framework Comparison**: When theoretically justified, the consistent mathematical foundation enables comparison across different analytical domains.

## 4. Demonstration: Political Discourse Analysis Framework

### 4.1 The Civic Virtue Framework as Domain Example

To demonstrate the universal methodology's capabilities, we present our most advanced implementation: the **Civic Virtue Framework** for political discourse analysis. This framework exemplifies how domain-specific requirements can be addressed within the universal architecture while maintaining all methodological advantages.

**Important Note**: This framework represents one domain-specific implementation among many possible applications. The methodology's value lies in its universal applicability, not in any particular framework implementation.

```

Figure 1 presents the Civic Virtue Framework analysis of political discourse, demonstrating how domain-specific implementations map conceptual forces within their analytical domain. This framework positions ten "gravity wells" on the circular boundary, with civic virtues (Dignity, Justice, Truth, Pragmatism, Hope) in the upper hemisphere and rhetorical challenges (Tribalism, Resentment, Manipulation, Fear, Fantasy) in the lower hemisphere.

### 4.2 Mathematical Foundation (Universal Across Domains)

The computational procedures work identically across all framework implementations, ensuring mathematical consistency while supporting diverse theoretical commitments.

#### 4.2.1 Circular Coordinate System

All frameworks employ the standard circular coordinate system:
- **Radius**: r = 1.0 (unit circle)
- **Angular positioning**: θ ∈ [0°, 360°) for well placement

Wells are positioned using standard polar coordinate equations:

$$x_i = r \cos(\theta_i)$$
$$y_i = r \sin(\theta_i)$$

Where $\theta_i$ is the angular position of well $i$ in degrees.

#### 4.2.2 Universal Narrative Positioning with Algorithmic Enhancement

Narratives are positioned inside the circle based on weighted gravitational pull from boundary wells, enhanced through sophisticated algorithms that work identically across all domains:

**Base Positioning:**
$$x_n = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \cdot s_i \cdot x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \cdot s_i}$$

$$y_n = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \cdot s_i \cdot y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \cdot s_i}$$

**Dominance Amplification (Domain-Agnostic):**
$$s_{enhanced} = \begin{cases}
1.0 + (s - 0.7)^{2.0} \times 0.8 & \text{if } s \geq 0.7 \\
s \times 1.1 & \text{if } 0.3 < s < 0.7 \\
(s / 0.3)^{1.5} & \text{if } s \leq 0.3
\end{cases}$$

**Adaptive Scaling (Universal):**
$$\alpha = 0.65 + \text{extremeness} \times (0.95 - 0.65)$$

**Final Position (Consistent Across Domains):**
$$x_{final} = x_n \times \alpha$$
$$y_{final} = y_n \times \alpha$$

Where:
- $N$ = number of wells (configurable per framework)
- $x_n, y_n$ = narrative position coordinates
- $w_i$ = well weight (framework-defined)
- $s_i$ = narrative score for well $i$ (0 to 1)
- $x_i, y_i$ = well position on circle boundary
- $\alpha$ = adaptive scaling factor (0.65 to 0.95)

### 4.3 Political Discourse Framework Configuration

This domain-specific implementation organizes conceptual forces into five dipoles appropriate to political discourse analysis:

**Dignity vs. Tribalism (Identity Dimension)**
- **Dignity**: Affirms individual moral worth based on character and agency
- **Tribalism**: Subordinates individual agency to group identity and dominance

**Justice vs. Resentment (Fairness Dimension)**  
- **Justice**: Seeks impartial, rule-based fairness through institutional reform
- **Resentment**: Centers on historical grievance and zero-sum moral scorekeeping

**Truth vs. Manipulation (Integrity Dimension)**
- **Truth**: Demonstrates intellectual honesty and engages with complexity
- **Manipulation**: Distorts information or exploits emotion to control interpretation

**Pragmatism vs. Fear (Stability Dimension)**
- **Pragmatism**: Emphasizes evidence-based, iterative problem-solving
- **Fear**: Focuses on threat and loss, often exaggerating danger

**Hope vs. Fantasy (Aspiration Dimension)**
- **Hope**: Offers grounded optimism with realistic paths forward  
- **Fantasy**: Promises final solutions without acknowledging complexity

## 5. Cross-Domain Validation and Technical Results

**Academic Accessibility**: Circular coordinate design and universal tool compatibility dramatically reduce adoption barriers while preserving analytical sophistication across all domains.

The methodology addresses critical needs for systematic tools capable of evaluating persuasive discourse across multiple fields of research and practice. The framework-agnostic design enables researchers to develop domain-appropriate analytical frameworks while benefiting from shared technical infrastructure and methodological consistency.

However, **domain-specific human validation remains the essential next step** for each framework implementation before claiming interpretive accuracy and practical utility within any particular field.
