## **‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS & DEPENDENCIES**

**Risks**:
- Experiment execution may reveal integration issues requiring troubleshooting
- Quality assurance threshold optimization may require multiple iterations
- Academic output generation complexity may extend beyond iteration scope

**Dependencies**:
- PostgreSQL database operational (‚úÖ Available)
- LLM API access with cost controls (‚úÖ Available) 
- Framework migration v2.0 complete (‚úÖ Available)
- Quality assurance system operational (‚úÖ Available)

**Mitigation**:
- Focus on civic_virtue framework (confirmed operational) for first experiment
- Scope experiment to manageable complexity for 2-day iteration
- Use existing quality thresholds rather than optimize during iteration
