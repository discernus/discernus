üß† **Essential Requirements for Dr. Maria Santos's Variance Validation Journey:**

- Conversational variance study design with multi-dimensional statistical analysis
- Real-time pattern recognition during batch analysis execution
- Statistical anomaly investigation through natural language queries
- Framework fit detection through variance threshold analysis
- Academic rigor maintained through comprehensive reliability metrics

Based on your comprehensive system capabilities and the second user story (Dr. Maria Santos conducting variance validation studies), here are the prioritized requirements for the essential conversational statistical validation experience:

## **Priority 1: Conversational Variance Study Design**

### **1.1 Statistical Experiment Configuration Through Chat**

**User Story Reference**: "I need to design a comprehensive variance study for the Civic Virtue framework. I want to test both single-LLM consistency across multiple runs and cross-LLM agreement patterns using our golden set corpus."

**Requirements**:

- Chainlit interface for natural language experiment specification
- Multi-dimensional study parameter configuration (texts √ó frameworks √ó LLMs √ó runs)
- Real-time cost estimation and completion time projection
- Automatic study matrix generation (17 texts √ó 3 LLMs √ó 5 runs = 255 analyses)

**Implementation Focus**:

```python
@cl.on_message
async def handle_variance_study_design(message: cl.Message):
    # Parse variance study parameters from conversation
    # Generate analysis matrix: texts √ó frameworks √ó models √ó runs
    # Calculate cost and time estimates
    # Display study configuration for approval
```


### **1.2 Integration with Existing Multi-Run Infrastructure**

**User Story Reference**: "The system will automatically calculate coefficient of variation, confidence intervals, and inter-model correlations"

**Requirements**:

- Leverage your existing universal multi-run dashboard capabilities
- Connect to your PostgreSQL v2.1 schema with runs table
- Utilize your real LLM integration (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro)
- Integration with your CostManager for budget tracking

**Implementation Focus**:

- Extend your existing `RealAnalysisService` for batch variance studies
- Use your current `DirectAPIClient` with systematic parameter tracking
- Leverage PostgreSQL `experiments` and `runs` tables for variance data storage


## **Priority 2: Real-Time Statistical Analysis**

### **2.1 Live Pattern Recognition During Execution**

**User Story Reference**: "After the first 50 analyses complete, Maria notices something interesting: 'The variance patterns are already showing structure. Most texts are showing CV values below 0.15, which is excellent for reliability.'"

**Requirements**:

- Streaming statistical analysis as results arrive
- Real-time coefficient of variation calculations
- Automatic outlier detection and flagging
- Progressive confidence interval updates

**Implementation Focus**:

```python
@cl.on_message
async def monitor_variance_study_progress():
    # Stream results from ongoing analysis
    # Calculate running CV statistics
    # Identify and flag high-variance texts
    # Update confidence intervals progressively
```


### **2.2 Statistical Anomaly Investigation**

**User Story Reference**: "The system highlights three texts with concerning variance patterns: a technical policy document about cryptocurrency regulation, a philosophical essay on environmental ethics, and a corporate diversity statement."

**Requirements**:

- Automatic identification of texts with CV > threshold (e.g., 0.20)
- Library panel highlighting of problematic analyses
- Cross-reference with framework fit scores
- Comparative analysis against corpus baseline

**Implementation Focus**:

- Statistical threshold detection algorithms
- Integration with your existing framework fit detection
- Library panel updates for anomaly visualization


## **Priority 3: Framework Fit Detection Through Variance**

### **3.1 High-Variance as Framework Mismatch Indicator**

**User Story Reference**: "High variance isn't just a reliability problem‚Äîit's a diagnostic tool for framework fit. Texts that don't belong in our corpus reveal themselves through inconsistent scoring patterns."

**Requirements**:

- Variance-based framework fit assessment
- Automatic corpus quality evaluation
- Text categorization: Core Texts, Boundary Cases, Outliers
- Framework domain boundary detection

**Implementation Focus**:

```python
def analyze_framework_fit_through_variance(variance_results):
    # Identify high-variance texts (CV > 0.20)
    # Assess framework fit correlation with variance patterns
    # Generate framework boundary recommendations
    # Flag texts for corpus refinement
```


### **3.2 LLM-Specific Bias Detection**

**User Story Reference**: "GPT-4o and Claude are showing strong inter-model correlation (r = 0.82), but Gemini is consistently divergent. Show me the systematic differences."

**Requirements**:

- Inter-model correlation analysis
- Systematic bias identification
- Model-specific performance patterns
- Consensus threshold establishment

**Implementation Focus**:

- Correlation matrix generation (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall's tau)
- Model bias pattern analysis
- Consensus scoring algorithms


## **Priority 4: Academic Statistical Rigor**

### **4.1 Publication-Ready Statistical Documentation**

**User Story Reference**: "Calculate Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency, intraclass correlation coefficients for inter-rater reliability treating LLMs as raters, and confidence intervals for all major metrics."

**Requirements**:

- Comprehensive reliability statistics generation
- Academic-quality statistical reporting
- Automated methodology documentation
- Replication package creation

**Implementation Focus**:

```python
def generate_academic_statistics(variance_data):
    # Calculate Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency
    # Compute ICC for inter-rater reliability
    # Generate confidence intervals for all metrics
    # Create publication-ready statistical tables
```


### **4.2 Variance Threshold Establishment**

**User Story Reference**: "I propose establishing CV < 0.20 as our reliability threshold for individual texts, and ICC > 0.75 as our minimum inter-model agreement standard."

**Requirements**:

- Statistical threshold configuration
- Quality control automation
- Reliability benchmarking
- Framework validation protocols

**Implementation Focus**:

- Threshold-based quality assessment
- Automated flagging systems
- Validation protocol generation
