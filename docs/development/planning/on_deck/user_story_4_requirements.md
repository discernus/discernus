# OK. Last user story.

🧠 **Essential Requirements for Dr. James Park's Prompt Engineering Journey:**

- Conversational prompt template optimization through systematic testing and iteration
- Framework-specific prompt architecture development with performance monitoring
- Real-time comparative analysis across multiple frameworks and LLM models
- Statistical validation of prompt modifications with automated testing workflows
- Academic rigor maintained through version control and experimental documentation

Based on your comprehensive system capabilities and the fourth user story (Dr. James Park iteratively improving prompt templates for framework compatibility issues), here are the prioritized requirements for the essential conversational prompt optimization experience:

## **Priority 1: Conversational Prompt Optimization Interface**

### **1.1 Framework-Specific Prompt Development Through Chat**

**User Story Reference**: "I'm seeing significant performance degradation with my Environmental Justice framework using the standard prompt template. The CV values are terrible—over 0.40 for most wells—and the LLMs seem confused about how to handle concepts like 'Intergenerational Responsibility' and 'Ecological Interdependence.'"

**Requirements**:

- Chainlit interface for natural language description of prompt performance issues
- Conversational guidance for diagnosing prompt-framework compatibility problems
- Real-time prompt modification suggestions based on framework characteristics
- Framework-specific prompt template generation and testing

**Implementation Focus**:

```python
@cl.on_message
async def handle_prompt_optimization(message: cl.Message):
    # Parse performance issues and framework characteristics
    # Suggest prompt modifications for framework compatibility
    # Generate framework-specific prompt variations
    # Track optimization hypothesis and results
```


### **1.2 Integration with Existing PromptTemplateManager**

**User Story Reference**: James's evolution from universal templates to framework-specific modules for different cognitive architectures

**Requirements**:

- Leverage your existing PromptTemplateManager with 442 lines of sophisticated prompt generation logic
- Extend to support conversational prompt optimization and A/B testing
- Integration with your experimental framework (`scoring_methodology.json`)
- Dynamic prompt generation from conversational requirements

**Implementation Focus**:

- Connect to your existing three prompt modes (API, Interactive, Experimental)
- Use your current framework-agnostic prompt architecture
- Leverage existing experimental configurations for systematic testing


## **Priority 2: Real-Time Performance Monitoring**

### **2.1 Cross-Framework Performance Analysis**

**User Story Reference**: "The modified prompt is improving Environmental Justice performance, but it's degrading performance on the Civic Virtue framework. The CV for traditional moral concepts like 'Truth' vs 'Manipulation' has increased from 0.19 to 0.34."

**Requirements**:

- Real-time coefficient of variation monitoring across multiple frameworks
- Automatic detection of performance trade-offs between frameworks
- Statistical comparison of prompt modifications across framework types
- Visual performance tracking and trend analysis

**Implementation Focus**:

```python
async def monitor_cross_framework_performance(prompt_modifications):
    # Calculate CV across all frameworks with new prompt
    # Compare against baseline performance metrics
    # Identify framework-specific improvement/degradation patterns
    # Generate recommendations for framework-specific optimization
```


### **2.2 Systematic Prompt Testing Pipeline**

**User Story Reference**: "Run each framework with both the original universal template and the new framework-specific modules. I want to see performance improvements for Environmental Justice without degradation for the established frameworks."

**Requirements**:

- Automated testing of prompt variations across multiple frameworks
- Integration with your existing multi-run validation capabilities (765 analyses)
- Statistical significance testing for prompt modifications
- Performance comparison dashboards and visualization

**Implementation Focus**:

- Leverage your existing RealAnalysisService and DirectAPIClient
- Use your current multi-LLM integration (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro)
- Integration with PostgreSQL experiments and runs tables for tracking


## **Priority 3: Framework-Specific Prompt Architecture**

### **3.1 Modular Prompt Design System**

**User Story Reference**: "I need to develop framework-specific prompt variations rather than trying to create a universal template. Environmental frameworks need systems thinking instructions, while traditional moral frameworks need immediate intuition assessment."

**Requirements**:

- Conversational design of modular prompt architectures
- Framework cognitive architecture analysis and prompt matching
- Template library for different types of moral and political reasoning
- Automatic prompt module selection based on framework characteristics

**Implementation Focus**:

```python
def design_framework_specific_prompts(framework_type, cognitive_architecture):
    # Analyze framework requirements (systems thinking vs intuitive assessment)
    # Generate appropriate prompt modules
    # Create framework-specific analytical instructions
    # Validate prompt-framework cognitive alignment
```


### **3.2 Prompt Validation and Compatibility Testing**

**User Story Reference**: "Framework-specific prompting shows CV improvements: Environmental Justice drops from 0.41 to 0.22, while Civic Virtue maintains 0.18 and Political Spectrum actually improves from 0.24 to 0.19."

**Requirements**:

- Systematic validation of prompt modifications across framework types
- Compatibility matrix tracking for prompt-framework combinations
- Performance optimization recommendations based on statistical analysis
- Automated quality assurance for prompt architectural changes

**Implementation Focus**:

- Statistical validation using your existing coefficient of variation analysis
- Integration with your framework switching system (symlink-based configuration)
- Performance tracking across your 4 available frameworks


## **Priority 4: Academic Documentation and Methodology**

### **4.1 Prompt Engineering Methodology Documentation**

**User Story Reference**: "Your framework-specific prompt engineering represents a significant methodological contribution. You've demonstrated that effective LLM-based analysis requires matching prompt structure to the cognitive architecture of different moral and political domains."

**Requirements**:

- Automatic documentation of prompt optimization processes
- Methodological innovation tracking and academic contribution recognition
- Complete replication packages for prompt engineering approaches
- Research synthesis and publication-ready documentation

**Implementation Focus**:

```python
async def document_prompt_methodology(optimization_session):
    # Generate comprehensive methodology documentation
    # Track prompt evolution and performance improvements
    # Create replication packages with complete experimental history
    # Provide academic-quality statistical analysis and reporting
```


### **4.2 Framework Taxonomy and Cognitive Architecture Mapping**

**User Story Reference**: "This suggests a taxonomy of framework types that require different prompt approaches: Immediate Moral Frameworks (Civic Virtue), Ideological Positioning Frameworks (Political Spectrum), and Systems Thinking Frameworks (Environmental Justice)."

**Requirements**:

- Conversational development of framework taxonomies
- Cognitive architecture analysis for different moral reasoning types
- Prompt template library organization by framework characteristics
- Predictive framework design based on cognitive requirements

**Implementation Focus**:

- Framework classification system based on cognitive processing requirements
- Template library integration with your existing 4 frameworks
- Extensibility for future framework development
