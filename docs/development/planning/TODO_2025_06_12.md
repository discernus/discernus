## 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### **1. Hierarchical Theme Detection Implementation** ⚠️ **URGENT**
**Reference**: `docs/development/planning/on_deck/Prompt Engineering Strategy - Hierarchical Theme Detection.md`

**Problem**: Current flat scoring produces moderate scores (0.3-0.7) across multiple wells instead of sharp hierarchical distinctions needed for academic analysis.

**Required Implementation**:
- [ ] **Three-Stage Prompt Architecture**: Replace current prompts with hierarchical ranking system
  - Stage 1: Identify top 2-3 dominant themes with forced rank ordering
  - Stage 2: Assign percentage weights (dominant theme 40-60%, others proportional)
  - Stage 3: Evidence grounding with specific text excerpts for scores >5%
- [ ] **Template Updates**: Modify `src/narrative_gravity/prompts/templates/` with new hierarchical approach
- [ ] **Validation Testing**: Test against synthetic extremes to achieve 90%+ single-well dominance
- [ ] **Cross-Model Testing**: Validate consistency across GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update prompt engineering guides with hierarchical methodology

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for implementation and validation

### **2. Visualization Mathematics Enhancement** ⚠️ **URGENT**
**Reference**: `docs/development/planning/on_deck/Visualization Mathematics Strategy - Extreme Position Representation.md`

**Problem**: Mathematical compression prevents extreme narratives from reaching visual boundaries, making genuine differences appear trivial.

**Required Implementation**:
- [ ] **Nonlinear Dominance Amplification**: Exponential weighting (base=2.5) to amplify high scores while suppressing noise
- [ ] **Adaptive Dynamic Scaling**: Scale factor based on score extremeness (0.6-0.95 range) instead of fixed 0.8
- [ ] **Boundary Snapping Logic**: Allow narratives >0.8 dominance to snap toward well boundaries (85%+ distance)
- [ ] **Multi-Modal Visual Enhancement**: Vector thickness, color intensity, radial rings for dominance hierarchy
- [ ] **A/B Testing Framework**: Systematic comparison of mathematical approaches with synthetic data
- [ ] **Integration**: Update `src/narrative_gravity/visualization/` with chosen approach

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for prototyping, testing, and integration

- [ ] **Training Materials**: Develop guides for human validators on framework interpretation
- [ ] **Evaluation Metrics**: Define success criteria for human-AI agreement on thematic analysis
- [ ] **Sample Selection**: Curate representative corpus for validation study
- [ ] **IRB Documentation**: Prepare human subjects research protocols if needed

### **5. Documentation and Training Updates**
- [ ] **User Guide Updates**: Reflect hierarchical prompting and enhanced visualization in documentation
- [ ] **Technical Documentation**: API documentation for component management and version control
- [ ] **Troubleshooting Guides**: Common issues and resolution procedures
- [ ] **Best Practices**: Lessons learned and optimization strategies from recent implementations
