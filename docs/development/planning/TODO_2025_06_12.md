## üö® **HIGH PRIORITY - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### **1. Hierarchical Theme Detection Implementation** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (June 12, 2025)
**Reference**: `docs/development/planning/on_deck/Prompt Engineering Strategy - Hierarchical Theme Detection.md`

**Problem**: Current flat scoring produces moderate scores (0.3-0.7) across multiple wells instead of sharp hierarchical distinctions needed for academic analysis.

**Completed Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ **Three-Stage Prompt Architecture**: Framework-agnostic hierarchical template v2.1.0 created
  - Stage 1: Identify top 2-3 dominant themes with forced rank ordering
  - Stage 2: Assign percentage weights (dominant theme 40-60%, others proportional)
  - Stage 3: Evidence grounding with specific text excerpts for scores >5%
- ‚úÖ **Template Updates**: Stored in component database with proper versioning
- ‚úÖ **Validation Testing**: 5/5 framework compatibility confirmed
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Model Testing**: Framework-agnostic design enables all LLM platforms
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Mathematical forcing functions eliminate flat distributions

**Completion**: All requirements fulfilled, archived deprecated prompts

### **2. Visualization Mathematics Enhancement** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (June 12, 2025)
**Reference**: `docs/development/planning/on_deck/Visualization Mathematics Strategy - Extreme Position Representation.md`

**Problem**: Mathematical compression prevents extreme narratives from reaching visual boundaries, making genuine differences appear trivial.

**Completed Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ **Nonlinear Dominance Amplification**: Exponential weighting (base=2.0) optimized through iteration
