# Phase Entry Criteria: Human Validation Studies

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the mandatory prerequisites for initiating Phase 2 human validation studies of the Narrative Gravity Wells methodology. Entry into the human validation phase represents a critical transition from technical development to empirical validation against human judgment. Premature entry risks wasting validation resources on unstable methodologies, while delayed entry prevents the empirical evidence necessary for academic credibility.
