[[8 June Project Strategic Analysis]]

# 1. Overview and Milestone Context
The Narrative Gravity Wells project is advancing through a validation-first development strategy, with three major milestones:
* **Milestone 1:** Validation Research Infrastructure (Completed)
* **Milestone 2:** Publication-Ready Academic Package (Validation, Expert Calibration, Replication)
* **Milestone 3:** Public Platform Deployment (Beta, Visualization, Outreach)

⠀The current phase is focused on rigorous validation and refinement to ensure that the system’s outputs are credible, interpretable, and well-documented before public release10.

# 2. Core Workstreams and Critical Tasks
# Workstream 1: Prompt Engineering & Scoring Framework Refinement
**Objective:** Develop prompts and scoring logic that surface thematic dominance and relative weighting, enabling the system to reflect narrative hierarchy and framework fit.
**Critical Tasks:**
* Redesign prompts to require ranking and relative weighting of driving wells.
* Implement scoring logic that supports nonlinear weighting and “winner-take-most” dynamics.
* Test prompts on synthetic and real-world narratives for sharpness of thematic distinction.
* Iterate based on observed model behavior and validation feedback.

⠀
# Workstream 2: Human–Machine Alignment & Validation
**Objective:** Benchmark LLM-derived theme weights against human expert and crowd judgments to establish reliability and surface systematic divergence.
**Critical Tasks:**
* Recruit and onboard domain expert annotators; design annotation protocols.
* Assemble a validation corpus (synthetic, historical, contemporary narratives).
* Run blind human annotation rounds; compute inter-rater reliability and salience ranking correlations.
* Compare LLM outputs to human data; identify and address systematic misalignments.
* Iterate prompts and scoring logic in response to validation findings.

⠀
# Workstream 3: Visualization Strategy Enhancement
**Objective:** Refine visualizations to accurately communicate both absolute scores and dominance hierarchy, and to address compression of extremes.
**Critical Tasks:**
* Prototype adaptive scaling and nonlinear mapping for narrative center placement.
* Implement visual cues for dominance (vector thickness, color gradients, edge snapping).
* Conduct user testing for interpretability and clarity.
* Standardize and document visualization defaults and user options.

⠀
# Workstream 4: Documentation, Transparency, and Ethical Guardrails
**Objective:** Ensure all capabilities, limitations, and validation outcomes are thoroughly documented and communicated to users and stakeholders.
**Critical Tasks:**
* Write a comprehensive technical white paper and executive summary.
* Maintain detailed changelogs, versioning, and metadata for all analyses.
* Publish open-source reference implementations and annotated notebooks.
* Develop interpretive guides and “do’s and don’ts” for end users.

⠀
# Workstream 5: Framework Fit Detection and Modular Extension
**Objective:** Enable the system to detect when narratives do not map well to current dipoles and to propose or pilot new wells as needed.
**Critical Tasks:**
* Add “framework fit” scoring and flagging to prompt outputs.
* Analyze low-fit cases to identify missing dimensions.
* Pilot new or extended dipoles; evaluate their impact on fit and interpretability.
* Integrate fit feedback into the user interface and documentation.

⠀
# Workstream 6: Data Infrastructure and Automation
**Objective:** Automate the analysis pipeline for scalability, reproducibility, and continuous validation.
**Critical Tasks:**
* Build standardized ingestion, preprocessing, and metadata capture systems.
* Containerize analysis scripts and parameterize for framework/model versioning.
* Automate batching, aggregation, and metric computation.
* Develop dashboards for monitoring performance, drift, and fit.
* Schedule periodic revalidation workflows for ongoing quality control.

⠀
# 3. Dependency and Blocker Analysis
# Critical Path and Interdependencies
* **Workstream 1** is foundational: All other streams depend on robust, validated prompts and scoring logic.
* **Workstream 2** (validation) cannot proceed meaningfully until Workstream 1 yields stable, interpretable outputs. Its findings feed back into prompt/scoring refinement.
* **Workstream 3** (visualization) requires finalized scoring logic to avoid visualizing misleading or diluted results.
* **Workstream 5** (framework fit) depends on prompt enhancements from Workstream 1 and validation from Workstream 2 to identify and flag misfit narratives.
* **Workstream 6** (automation) should not be fully built out until prompts and scoring are stable; otherwise, you risk automating flawed processes.
* **Workstream 4** (documentation) can proceed in parallel, but must be continually updated as other streams evolve.

⠀Blockers and Navigation Strategies
* **Prompt and Scoring Instability:**
  * *Blocker:* Changes in prompt logic can invalidate previous validation and visualization work.
  * *Mitigation:* Use semantic versioning and “stability windows” for prompt iterations; only advance dependent workstreams when prompts are locked for a cycle.
* **Human Subject Recruitment:**
  * *Blocker:* Expert annotator availability and IRB processes may delay validation.
  * *Mitigation:* Recruit from multiple pools, use asynchronous/remote protocols, and supplement with crowdsourced spot-checks.
* **Resource Constraints:**
  * *Blocker:* Limited technical, annotation, and user-testing capacity.
  * *Mitigation:* Parallelize technical work where possible, use off-the-shelf visualization libraries, and prioritize high-impact validation cases.
* **Feedback Loop Management:**
  * *Blocker:* Iterative changes can lead to endless refinement cycles.
  * *Mitigation:* Define clear “good enough” criteria (e.g., target correlation thresholds) and set maximum iteration counts per milestone.

⠀
# 4. Sequencing and Schedule (16-Week Plan)
# Phase 1: Foundation Setting (Weeks 1–4)
* **Workstream 1:** Finalize hierarchical prompts, implement relative weighting, test on synthetic narratives.
* **Workstream 4:** Begin documentation and version control.
* **Workstream 2:** Design annotation protocols, begin expert recruitment.
* **Workstream 6:** Set up basic data infrastructure for multi-run testing.

⠀Phase 2: Validation Foundation (Weeks 5–8)
* **Workstream 2:** Launch human annotation studies, collect reliability data.
* **Workstream 1:** Iterate prompts based on validation results.
* **Workstream 3:** Prototype visualization improvements.
* **Workstream 5:** Begin framework fit detection prototyping.

⠀Phase 3: Integration and Optimization (Weeks 9–12)
* **Workstream 3:** Implement and user-test visualization enhancements.
* **Workstream 5:** Deploy fit detection and pilot new dipoles.
* **Workstream 2:** Expand validation to more narrative types.
* **Workstream 6:** Build out automated pipeline.
* **Workstream 4:** Draft comprehensive technical documentation.

⠀Phase 4: Systematization and Documentation (Weeks 13–16)
* **Workstream 6:** Deploy full automation and monitoring.
* **Workstream 4:** Finalize white papers, user guides, and public documentation.
* **All Streams:** Establish ongoing validation and monitoring routines.

⠀
# 5. Cross-Workstream Coordination
* **Weekly Integration Reviews:**
  * Synchronize progress, resolve blockers, and reallocate resources as needed.
* **Shared Validation Infrastructure:**
  * Use common datasets and annotation tools across workstreams.
* **Modular Development:**
  * Ensure API-based interfaces and component independence for parallel work.
* **Version Control:**
  * Track prompt, scoring, and framework changes to maintain reproducibility.

⠀
# 6. Budget and Resource Alignment
* **Major costs:** Human annotation, LLM API calls, lightweight user testing, and infrastructure (mostly covered by your time and open-source tools).
* **Expect phased spending:** Validation (human annotation) and prompt refinement will consume most of the budget early; reserve funds for platform polish and outreach near Milestone 3.
* **Leverage volunteers and free-tier services** to stretch the budget and reduce risk.

⠀
# 7. Documentation and Transparency
* **Document all assumptions, limitations, and validation outcomes** at every stage.
* **Publish open-source code and replication packages** for academic credibility.
* **Maintain clear user guidance** on what the system can and cannot do, especially regarding alignment with human perception.

⠀
# 8. Advancing Toward Milestone 3
By following this structured, dependency-aware plan, you will:
* Sharpen the analytical and interpretive power of the Narrative Gravity Wells model.
* Build a transparent, reproducible validation record.
* Deliver a user-facing platform that is both credible and clearly bounded in its claims.
* Position the project for academic publication and broader adoption while maintaining epistemic humility and adaptability as LLM capabilities evolve.

⠀
**This consolidated roadmap ensures that each workstream advances in lockstep with critical dependencies, validation, and documentation—maximizing the impact and credibility of the project within your budget and timeline.**
