## **Priority 3: Research Insight Generation**

### **3.1 Methodological Discovery Through Conversation**

**User Story Reference**: "The evidence-based ranking approach appears to help LLMs recognize when narratives don't align with your civic virtue dipoles"

**Requirements**:

- Insight generation from experimental pattern analysis
- Methodological hypothesis formation based on data patterns
- Cross-framework comparative analysis capabilities
- Evidence-based reasoning about experimental improvements

**Implementation Focus**:

```python
def generate_methodological_insights(experimental_data):
    # Identify significant patterns in experimental results
    # Generate hypotheses about methodological improvements
    # Provide evidence-based explanations for performance changes
    # Suggest implications for future research directions
```


### **3.2 Academic Publication Support**

**User Story Reference**: "This is becoming a clear narrative for my conference presentation. The evidence-based hierarchical prompting represents a methodological contribution"

**Requirements**:

- Automatic generation of publication-ready statistical summaries
- Effect size calculations and significance testing
- Research narrative synthesis from experimental progression
- Methodology documentation and replication package generation

**Implementation Focus**:

- Statistical significance testing (p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals)
- Academic-quality documentation generation
- Research synthesis and narrative construction from experimental data


## **Priority 4: Research Continuity and Context**

### **4.1 Contextual Experimental Retrieval**

**User Story Reference**: "Looking across all my experiments, which experimental design choices produced the most reliable results?"

**Requirements**:

- Cross-cutting analysis of experimental design patterns
- Reliability assessment across different experimental configurations
- Cost-effectiveness analysis and optimization recommendations
- Best practice identification from experimental history

**Implementation Focus**:

```python
async def analyze_experimental_reliability(research_archive):
    # Assess reliability patterns across experimental designs
    # Identify optimal experimental configurations
    # Calculate cost-effectiveness metrics
    # Generate best practice recommendations
```


### **4.2 Research Documentation and Synthesis**

**User Story Reference**: "This conversation has helped me see patterns I missed when I was focused on individual experiments"

**Requirements**:
