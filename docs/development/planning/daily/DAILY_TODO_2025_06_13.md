- **Analysis Protocol**: 24 total runs (3 runs per text for reliability validation)
- **Technical Stack**: GPT-4.1-mini, civic_virtue v2025.06.04, 6-layer QA validation
- **Expected Duration**: ~40 minutes total execution

**Success Criteria**: ‚úÖ Complete experiment specification ready for immediate execution tomorrow

**üîç IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IDENTIFIED**: Two different types of specifications completed:
1. **Experiment Definition Example** (`CIVIC_VIRTUE_EXPERIMENT_SPECIFICATION_2025_06_13.md`) - Specific experiment ready to execute
2. **Experiment System Specification** (`docs/specifications/EXPERIMENT_SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md`) - Complete documentation of system capabilities, options, and parameters

**üìö DOCUMENTATION GAP FILLED**: The system specification was missing from our docs - we had CLI guides and component docs, but no comprehensive specification of the experimental design space and all available options.
