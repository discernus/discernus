# Interface Design Principles
*Essential UX Patterns for Discernus*

This document establishes the core design philosophy and essential patterns for all Discernus interfaces. These principles ensure consistent, accessible user experiences while maintaining the three foundational commitments.

## Core Design Philosophy

### The "Smart Colleague" Model

Every interface should feel like working with an exceptionally knowledgeable colleague who:
- **Explains reasoning** before presenting conclusions
- **Shows their work** for all analytical steps
- **Admits uncertainty** when confidence is low
- **Provides cost estimates** upfront
- **Enables replication** automatically

**Success Metric**: Users should say "This makes me feel smarter" rather than "This is complicated."

### Three Foundational Commitments in Interface Design

1. **Mathematical Reliability**: Always separate LLM insights from calculated results, show calculation process
2. **Cost Transparency**: Provide upfront cost estimates and real-time budget monitoring
3. **Complete Reproducibility**: Generate complete audit trails and enable easy replication

## Essential Interface Patterns

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

#### Core Pattern: Conversation-Style Commands
```bash
# Natural language commands
discernus analyze "How does political rhetoric change during crises?" --corpus crisis_speeches/
discernus estimate --framework framework.md --corpus corpus/ --model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

# Cost-aware workflows
discernus analyze --framework policy.md --corpus documents/ --budget 50.00
> Cost Analysis:
> - Full analysis: $73.50 (exceeds budget)
> - Express mode: $22.30 (within budget)
> Select approach: [express/increase-budget/cancel]
```

#### Interactive Validation
```bash
discernus validate framework framework.md
> ✅ Structure: Complete
> ⚠️  Scoring: Some criteria could be more specific
> Fix automatically? [y/N/edit]
```

### Web Interface

#### Core Pattern: Progressive Configuration
```
Step 1: Research Question
[What do you want to analyze?]

Step 2: Framework Selection
○ Political Communication Framework (~$0.50 per document)
○ Brand Crisis Communication (~$0.35 per document)
○ Custom Framework (variable cost)

Step 3: Cost Approval
Estimated: $23.50 for 47 documents
Budget remaining: $76.50 / $100.00
[Proceed] [Express Mode: $8.75]
```

#### Real-Time Progress
```
Analysis in Progress: Policy Communication Study
Progress: ████████████████████████████████████░░░░ 
Documents: 34 / 47 completed
Cost: $17.25 spent, $6.25 remaining
Current: Analyzing "Climate Policy Statement.pdf"
```

### API Design

#### Core Pattern: Cost-Transparent Endpoints
```json
POST /api/v1/analyze/estimate
{
  "framework": "policy_communication_v1",
  "corpus_size": 47,
  "models": ["claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"]
}

Response:
{
  "estimated_cost": 23.50,
  "estimated_time_minutes": 45,
  "alternatives": [
    {"mode": "express", "cost": 8.75, "time_minutes": 18}
  ]
}
```

#### Reproducibility-First Responses
```json
{
  "session_id": "session_20250115_143022",
  "status": "completed",
  "results": {...},
  "reproducibility": {
    "replication_command": "discernus replicate session_20250115_143022",
    "audit_trail": "/api/v1/sessions/session_20250115_143022/audit"
  }
}
```

## User Experience Essentials

### Onboarding: 5-Minute Success
```bash
discernus quickstart
> Welcome to Discernus! What type of analysis?
> 1. Academic research 2. Business analysis 3. Organizational decisions
> Your choice: 2
> 
> Framework: Brand Sentiment Analysis v1.0
> Cost: ~$0.25 per document
> Do you have text files to analyze? [y/N]
```

### Error Recovery: Intelligent Messages
```
Error: Framework validation failed
❌ Issue: Scoring criteria for 'emotional_appeal' unclear

Here's what works:
Low (0.0-0.3): Purely factual language
Medium (0.4-0.6): Some emotional language
High (0.7-1.0): Strong emotional appeals

Add this example to your framework? [y/N]
```

### Cost Control: Budget-Aware
```bash
discernus analyze --framework policy.md --corpus documents/
> Estimated cost: $23.50 (47 documents × $0.50 each)
> Budget remaining: $76.50 of $100.00 daily limit
> Alternative: Express mode for $8.75
> Proceed? [y/N/express]
```

## Accessibility Standards

### Multi-Modal Support
- **Visual**: Rich visualizations with alternative text
- **Textual**: Complete text-based alternatives
- **Auditory**: Screen reader compatibility

### Cognitive Load Management
- **Chunking**: Present complex information in digestible segments
- **Progressive disclosure**: Build understanding step by step
- **Clear feedback**: Immediate confirmation of actions

### Language Considerations
- **Clear terminology**: Avoid jargon, explain technical terms
- **Consistent formatting**: Numbers, dates, currency
- **Cultural adaptation**: Citation styles, date formats

## Performance Standards

### Response Time Expectations
- **Immediate** (<100ms): Interface interactions
- **Fast** (<1s): Cost estimation, validation
- **Responsive** (<5s): Analysis start, progress updates
- **Batch** (>5s): Full analysis with progress indicators

### Progress Communication
```
Analysis Progress: Policy Communication Study
Stage 1: Framework Validation ✅ (2.3s)
Stage 2: Corpus Processing ✅ (8.7s)
Stage 3: Document Analysis ⏳ (23/47 complete, 12 min remaining)
Current cost: $17.25 / $23.50 estimated
```

## Quality Assurance

### User Testing Focus
- **Time to first success**: <5 minutes for new users
- **Task completion rate**: >90% for common workflows
- **Error recovery**: Clear path to resolution
- **Cost prediction accuracy**: ±10% of actual costs

### Interface Consistency
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy, readable fonts
- **Color scheme**: Professional, accessible contrast
- **Interaction states**: Hover, active, disabled, loading
- **Error handling**: Helpful, actionable messages

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- **Perceived Intelligence**: System understands user needs
- **Trust and Confidence**: Users trust analysis results
- **Efficiency**: Faster than alternative methods
- **Empowerment**: Users feel more capable

### Three Foundational Commitments
- **Mathematical Reliability**: 100% of calculations show methodology
- **Cost Transparency**: Estimates within ±10% of actual costs
- **Complete Reproducibility**: >95% of analyses can be replicated

---

**THIN Principle**: Maximum usability, minimum complexity. Every interface should amplify human intelligence while maintaining transparency, cost control, and reproducibility.
