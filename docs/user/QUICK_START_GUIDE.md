# Discernus Quick Start Guide

**Run your first experiment in 5 minutes**

This guide will get you up and running with Discernus using the nano_test_experiment, which takes about 47 seconds and costs approximately $0.014.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13.5+ installed
- Google Cloud account with Vertex AI enabled
- Discernus installed (see [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md))

## Step 1: Verify Installation (1 minute)

```bash
# Check system status
make check

# Should show: âœ… System ready
```

## Step 2: Run Nano Test Experiment (2 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to the test experiment
cd projects/nano_test_experiment

# Run the experiment
discernus run .

# Expected output:
# âœ… Analysis completed (2 documents, ~30 seconds)
# âœ… Synthesis completed (~17 seconds)
# ðŸ’° Total cost: ~$0.014
```

## Step 3: Verify Results (1 minute)

```bash
# Check the results directory
ls runs/*/results/

# You should see:
# - final_report.md (main results)
# - analysis.json (raw scores)
# - evidence.csv (supporting quotes)
# - scores.csv (dimensional scores)
```

## Step 4: Review Results (1 minute)

```bash
# Open the final report
open runs/*/results/final_report.md

# Or view in terminal
cat runs/*/results/final_report.md
```

## What Just Happened?

The nano_test_experiment analyzed 2 short documents using a simple sentiment framework:

- **Document 1**: Positive sentiment test text
- **Document 2**: Negative sentiment test text
- **Framework**: Binary sentiment analysis (positive/negative scores)
- **Output**: Dimensional scores, evidence, and synthesis report

## Next Steps

### Run More Experiments
