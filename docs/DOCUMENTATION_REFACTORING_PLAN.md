# üìã Discernus Documentation Refactoring Plan
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Purpose**: Transform scattered, domain-specific documentation into coherent, domain-neutral platform guide

---

## **üéØ Executive Summary: Why This Matters**

This documentation refactoring is **foundational to project success**, not routine maintenance. Current documentation problems are causing:

### **Agent Drift Crisis**
- AI agents consistently "run off like puppies" and write THICK code that violates architecture
- They solve immediate problems but create 10 new problems
- User must constantly play shepherd role - it's tedious and unsustainable
- Agents deviate from vision, philosophy, and architecture despite briefings

### **Strategic Incoherence**
- Scattered PM documents create conflicting visions (SOAR vs. Discernus branding)
- Domain-specific language limits platform adoption beyond political science
- Key infrastructure (agent registry, model registry) is foundational but underdocumented
- THIN compliance violations found during comprehensive audit

### **Mission-Critical Requirements**
- **Mathematical Reliability**: LLMs cannot be trusted for calculations (inconsistent and opaque)
- **Human-Readable Provenance**: Current logs are machine-readable "wall of code"
- **Universal Applicability**: Platform must work for think tanks, journalists, corporations, religious organizations, etc.
- **Drupal-Style Ecosystem**: Tightly controlled core + open extension modules

**Strategic Context**: We audited THIN compliance and found critical violations. The solution requires systematic documentation refactoring that prevents agent drift and enables the platform vision.

---

## **üèóÔ∏è Architecture Requirements**

### **Mathematical Reliability (Critical)**
- **Problem**: LLMs are inconsistent and opaque for calculations - fatal flaws for statistical analysis
- **Solution**: Hybrid intelligence architecture
  - LLM designs analytical approach
  - Secure code executor performs calculations
  - LLM interprets results in natural language
- **Documentation Impact**: All analytical workflows must demonstrate this pattern

### **Human-Readable Provenance**
- **Problem**: Current artifacts are machine-readable but not human-accessible
- **Current State**: "Wall of code" that doesn't serve research archive needs
- **Solution**: Make reports look like "well-structured academic research archive"
- **Documentation Impact**: Chronolog and provenance systems need human-friendly presentation

### **Agent Drift Prevention**
- **Problem**: Agents consistently write THICK code despite briefings
- **Examples**: Extensive parsing, hardcoded intelligence, monolithic architecture
- **Solution**: Documentation that makes it "easier to do right thing, harder to do wrong thing"
- **Documentation Impact**: Every page must include THIN compliance guidance and examples

### **Universal Applicability**
- **Problem**: Current docs focus on "computational social science" and "political analysis"
- **Vision**: Platform for any rhetorical text analysis across domains
- **Use Cases**: Think tanks, journalists, media organizations, corporations, government agencies, NGOs, hobbyists, divinity departments, religious organizations
- **Documentation Impact**: Domain-neutral language and examples throughout

---

## **üèõÔ∏è Governance Model: Drupal-Style Ecosystem**

### **User's Strategic Experience**
- Former CMO at Acquia with "front row seat" to Dries's Drupal management
- Wants to take those architectural and governance principles forward
- Proven model for open source platform with controlled core

### **Core Principles**
- **Tightly controlled core** with predictable interfaces
- **Open extension ecosystem** with independent lifecycles  
- **Trademark protection** for fork deterrence and governance
- **Community governance** with quality standards
- **Clear boundaries** between core platform and extension modules

### **Documentation Impact**
- Every document must clearly define core vs. extension boundaries
- Extension development guides must follow Drupal patterns
- Governance documentation must establish trademark and quality standards
- Platform architecture must enable module ecosystem

---

## **üéØ Strategic Vision**

**Mission**: Create documentation that makes it "easier to do the right thing and harder to do the wrong thing" for both human developers and AI agents working on Discernus.

**Core Challenge**: Current documentation is scattered across PM folders, uses domain-specific language, and lacks operational detail for fresh agents.

**Solution**: Systematic 6-phase refactoring with detailed execution guides, content transformation rules, and quality gates.

## **üèóÔ∏è Three Foundational Platform Commitments**

**Implemented**: January 2025 during Phase 1 completion
**Rationale**: Source material analysis revealed these themes as equally critical to platform success

### **Mathematical Reliability**
**Critical Foundation**: LLMs are inconsistent and opaque for calculations‚Äîfatal flaws for statistical analysis. Every architectural component must implement the hybrid intelligence pattern: LLM designs analytical approach ‚Üí secure code executor performs calculations ‚Üí LLM interprets results in natural language.

### **Cost Transparency**
**Institutional Adoption Enabler**: Academic and organizational adoption requires cost predictability. Every architectural component must provide upfront cost estimation, budget controls, and intelligent model selection to ensure predictable pricing.

### **Complete Reproducibility**
**Zero Mystery Commitment**: Non-negotiable commitment that there should be zero mystery as to how analysis was done and how results were generated. Every architectural component must maintain complete audit trails, decision documentation, and provenance chains that enable independent researchers to achieve deterministically identical results and defend their work under academic scrutiny. This includes full calculation transparency with complete visibility into all mathematical operations, parameters, and computational procedures.

### **Implementation Record**
**Date**: January 2025, Phase 1 implementation
**Reason**: User feedback during Phase 1 completion identified the need to elevate cost transparency from feature to core principle and establish complete reproducibility as equally foundational to mathematical reliability. User specified that if complete reproducibility is not reflected in documentation at the end of refactor, "we've failed" - emphasizing this is about academic credibility and institutional trust, not just documentation quality.

**Changes Made**:
- Added Critical Themes Checklist to all phases and agent templates
- Elevated cost transparency in strategic positioning
- Emphasized complete reproducibility as architectural requirement
- Integrated calculation transparency into reproducibility commitment
- Softened activist language to avoid "activating antibodies"
- Updated all deliverables to reflect these three equally-weighted commitments

## **üìä Current State Analysis**

### **Key Insights from Strategic Review**
1. **SOAR terminology must be absorbed** into Discernus (not separate namespace)
2. **Domain-neutrality is critical** - political science is lead use case, not only use case  
3. **THIN compliance** means LLM intelligence + minimal software parsing
4. **Drupal-style ecosystem** - controlled core, open extensions
5. **Agent registry and model registry** are foundational but underdocumented

### **Content Transformation Rules**
**Domain-Neutral Language**:
- "computational social science" ‚Üí "computational text analysis"
- "political rhetoric analysis" ‚Üí "rhetorical communication analysis"  
- "academic researchers" ‚Üí "researchers, analysts, and organizations"
- "political speeches" ‚Üí "rhetorical texts"

**Audience Expansion**:
- Add examples: think tanks, journalists, corporations, religious studies
- Include use cases: brand analysis, policy research, content strategy
- Emphasize platform flexibility across domains

## **üî• Critical Success Factors**

### **For Fresh Agents: Remember These Key Points**

1. **This is foundational work** - not routine documentation cleanup
2. **Agent drift is a real problem** - your documentation must prevent THICK code
3. **Mathematical reliability is non-negotiable** - LLMs cannot be trusted for calculations
4. **Universal applicability is the goal** - not just academic research
5. **Drupal-style ecosystem is the vision** - core platform + extension modules

### **Agent Drift Prevention Checklist**
Before completing any phase, ask yourself:
- [ ] Would this prevent an agent from writing extensive parsing logic?
- [ ] Does this make THIN patterns easier than THICK patterns?
- [ ] Are the architecture requirements crystal clear?
- [ ] Would a corporate user understand this is for them too?
- [ ] Does this support the module ecosystem vision?
