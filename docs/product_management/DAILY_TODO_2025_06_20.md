  - Document scoring patterns and theoretical consistency
  - Create visualization outputs showing MFT foundation patterns
  - Prepare preliminary evidence package for expert consultation

- [ ] **Academic Paper Draft Outline**
  - Create outline for "Computational Validation of Moral Foundations Theory"
  - Plan methodology section with implementation details
  - Design results section structure for validation evidence
  - Prepare discussion section addressing limitations and future research

**Success Criteria**: Professional academic documentation ready for expert review
