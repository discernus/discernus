## 🔄 **DAILY WORKFLOW**

### **Morning Planning** (5 minutes)
1. **Review current iteration progress** in `CURRENT_ITERATION_DISCERNUS_MVP.md`
2. **Check today's TODO** in `DAILY_TODO_YYYY_MM_DD.md`
3. **Prioritize from backlog** if needed using `BACKLOG.md`

### **Daily Execution**

- Update progress directly in files
- Add new items to BACKLOG.md for future planning

### **Evening Review** (5 minutes)
1. **Update TODO completion status**
2. **Create tomorrow's TODO** file (copy template, update date)
3. **Add any discoveries to BACKLOG** for iteration planning

## 📅 **WEEKLY ITERATION MANAGEMENT**

### **Weekly Review Process**
1. **Assess current iteration milestones** against 12-week plan
2. **Review completed TODOs** from the week
3. **Prioritize BACKLOG items** for next week
4. **Update strategic documents** if direction changes

### **Iteration Planning**
