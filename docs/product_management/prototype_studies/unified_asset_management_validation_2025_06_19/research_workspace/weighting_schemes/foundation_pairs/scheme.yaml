version: v1.0
scheme_type: dipole_based

description: |
  Weighting scheme optimized for moral foundations analysis using dipole pairs.
  Implements hierarchical weighting based on empirical research showing
  differential foundation usage across political orientations and cultures.
  Emphasizes individualizing vs binding foundation distinctions.

# =============================================================================
# THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
# =============================================================================

theoretical_basis:
  primary_research: "Haidt, J. & Graham, J. (2007-2013) Moral Foundations Theory research"
  core_finding: |
    Liberals primarily rely on individualizing foundations (Care, Fairness)
    while conservatives use all foundations more equally. Foundation usage
    patterns predict political orientation with high accuracy.
  
  empirical_support:
    - "Cross-cultural validation across 67+ countries"
    - "Strong correlation with liberal-conservative self-identification"
    - "Predictive validity for political voting behavior"
    - "Replication across multiple research groups"

# =============================================================================
# WEIGHTING PHILOSOPHY
# =============================================================================

weighting_approach:
  method: hierarchical_differential
  principle: individualizing_vs_binding
  
  core_insight: |
    Not all moral foundations are used equally across populations.
    Weighting should reflect empirically observed foundation usage patterns
    while maintaining sensitivity to different moral profiles.

foundation_categories:
  individualizing:
    description: "Foundations focused on individual welfare and rights"
    political_association: "Liberal/progressive moral priorities"
    foundations:
      - Care_Harm
      - Fairness_Cheating
    
  binding:
    description: "Foundations focused on group cohesion and social order"
    political_association: "Conservative moral priorities"
    foundations:
      - Loyalty_Betrayal
      - Authority_Subversion
      - Sanctity_Degradation

# =============================================================================
# FOUNDATION WEIGHTS
# =============================================================================

foundation_weights:
  
  # Primary Tier - Individualizing Foundations
  Care_Harm:
    weight: 1.0
    tier: primary
    category: individualizing
    justification: |
      Care/Harm is the most universally recognized moral foundation across
      cultures and political orientations. Central to moral reasoning in
      most ethical frameworks and political positions.
    
    political_usage:
      liberal: 0.95    # Very high usage among liberals
      conservative: 0.80  # High but lower usage among conservatives
      libertarian: 0.70   # Moderate usage among libertarians
  
  Fairness_Cheating:
    weight: 0.95
    tier: primary  
    category: individualizing
    justification: |
      Fairness/Cheating is highly valued across political spectrum but with
      different interpretations. Slightly lower than Care due to definitional
      variations (equality vs. proportionality).
    
    political_usage:
      liberal: 0.90    # Very high usage, emphasis on equality
      conservative: 0.75  # High usage, emphasis on proportionality  
      libertarian: 0.85   # Very high usage, emphasis on merit
  
  # Secondary Tier - Binding Foundations
  Loyalty_Betrayal:
    weight: 0.70
    tier: secondary
    category: binding
    justification: |
      Loyalty/Betrayal shows strong variation across political orientations.
      Important for conservatives, less emphasized by liberals. Moderate
      weight reflects this differential usage pattern.
    
    political_usage:
      liberal: 0.40    # Lower usage among liberals
      conservative: 0.85  # High usage among conservatives
      libertarian: 0.50   # Variable usage among libertarians
  
  Authority_Subversion:
    weight: 0.65
    tier: secondary
    category: binding  
    justification: |
      Authority/Subversion shows the largest political divide. Conservatives
      value legitimate authority while liberals are more skeptical. Weight
      reflects average across populations with high variance.
    
    political_usage:
      liberal: 0.25    # Low usage among liberals
      conservative: 0.80  # High usage among conservatives
      libertarian: 0.35   # Low usage, anti-authority orientation
  
  Sanctity_Degradation:
    weight: 0.60
    tier: tertiary
    category: binding
    justification: |
      Sanctity/Degradation is least universally used foundation. Primarily
      activated in religious/traditional contexts. Lower weight reflects
      limited but intense usage in specific populations.
    
    political_usage:
      liberal: 0.20    # Very low usage among secular liberals
      conservative: 0.75  # High usage among religious conservatives
      libertarian: 0.30   # Low usage, personal freedom emphasis

# CALCULATION METHODOLOGY
# =============================================================================

calculation_method:
  foundation_scoring:
    approach: weighted_averaging
    formula: "weighted_sum(foundation_scores * foundation_weights) / sum(weights)"
    normalization: "0.0 to 1.0 scale preservation"
  
  composite_scores:
    individualizing_score:
      calculation: "(Care_score * 1.0 + Fairness_score * 0.95) / 1.95"
      interpretation: "Liberal moral priority strength"
      
    binding_score:
      calculation: "(Loyalty_score * 0.70 + Authority_score * 0.65 + Sanctity_score * 0.60) / 1.95"
      interpretation: "Conservative moral priority strength"
      
    moral_profile:
      calculation: "binding_score / (individualizing_score + binding_score)"
      interpretation: "0.0 = purely individualizing, 1.0 = purely binding"
