## Studies Index

### 🏗️ Unified Asset Management Validation Study
**Directory:** `unified_asset_management_validation_2025_06_19/`  
**Date:** June 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Study Objectives:**
- Implement and validate unified asset management architecture
- Demonstrate content-addressable storage for frameworks and templates
- Conduct comparative validation between dipole and non-dipole frameworks
- Establish foundation for academic credibility and expert consultation

**Key Deliverables:**
- Prototype asset ingestion pipeline with hash-based storage
- YAML standardization for IDITI, Three Wells, and MFT frameworks
- Comparative validation experiment with theoretical coherence verification
- Complete academic documentation and audit trails

**Strategic Impact:**
- Proves feasibility of unified asset management architecture
- Validates both dipole and non-dipole framework effectiveness
- Establishes replication capabilities for academic peer review
- Provides foundation for expert consultation with Haidt lab
