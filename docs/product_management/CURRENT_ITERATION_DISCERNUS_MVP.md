## 📋 **13-WEEK PHASE BREAKDOWN**

### **Phase 0: Unified Asset Management Foundation** (Weeks -3 to 0)
**Status**: 🚨 **CRITICAL PREREQUISITE** - Disciplined Research Platform Infrastructure

#### **Strategic Rationale: Academic Credibility Foundation**
Before pursuing expert consultation and validation studies, establish **disciplined, defensible, replicable, and auditable** research infrastructure. Current five-dimensional experiment architecture (texts, frameworks, prompt templates, weighting schemes, evaluators) requires systematic asset management for academic credibility.

**Core Infrastructure Objectives:**
- **Unified Asset Format**: YAML standardization for all researcher-developed assets
- **Content-Addressable Storage**: Hash-based integrity extending proven corpus pattern
- **Two-Tier Architecture**: Development workspace separate from immutable storage
- **Academic Audit Trail**: Complete replication packages for independent verification

#### **Week -3: Foundation Architecture (June 19-26, 2025)**
- [ ] **Framework YAML Conversion & MFT Validation**
  - ✅ Validate theoretically accurate `moral_foundations_theory` framework (Haidt dipole structure)
  - ✅ Convert IDITI framework from JSON to unified YAML format
  - Convert Three Wells Political framework (non-dipole comparison framework)
  - Establish framework development workspace with semantic organization
  - Test framework loading and compatibility with production systems
  - **STRATEGIC FOCUS**: MFT (dipole) + Three Wells (non-dipole) for comparative validation
  - **DEFERRED**: Other legacy framework conversions to later iteration if time permits

- [ ] **Prompt Template Management System**
  - Create separate `prompt_templates/` workspace independent of frameworks
  - Extract embedded prompt logic from database to YAML template files
  - Design template-framework compatibility matrix and versioning
  - Enable prompt template reusability across multiple frameworks

#### **Week -2: Content-Addressable Storage (June 26 - July 3, 2025)**
- [ ] **Universal Asset Storage Implementation**
  ```
  asset_storage/
  ├── frameworks/{hash_prefix}/{hash_middle}/{hash_full}/
  ├── prompt_templates/{hash_prefix}/{hash_middle}/{hash_full}/
  ├── weighting_schemes/{hash_prefix}/{hash_middle}/{hash_full}/
  └── evaluator_configs/{hash_prefix}/{hash_middle}/{hash_full}/
  ```

- [ ] **Asset Ingestion Pipeline**
  - Extend corpus hash-based pattern to all asset types
  - Implement content-addressable deduplication and integrity verification
  - Create development → storage ingestion workflow
  - Database schema extensions for universal asset versioning

#### **Week -1: Experiment Integration (July 3-10, 2025)**
- [ ] **Enhanced Experiment Definition Format**
  ```yaml
  experiment_meta:
    name: "MFT Academic Validation Study"

      # System resolves to content hash
    prompt_template:
      name: "hierarchical_analysis"  
      version: "v2.1"
      # System resolves to content hash
  ```

- [ ] **Asset Resolution System**
  - Convert semantic asset references to hash-based storage
  - Verify integrity of all referenced assets before experiment execution
