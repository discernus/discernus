- **Competition from Existing Tools**: Emphasize expert collaboration advantage
- **Academic Timeline Pressures**: Build in buffer time for review cycles

## üéØ **CURRENT STATUS ASSESSMENT (June 20, 2025)**

### **Major Accomplishments Beyond Plan**
- ‚úÖ **Architectural Breakthrough**: Unified YAML framework architecture eliminates fundamental configuration mismatches.
- ‚úÖ **Codebase Audit & Cleanup**: Obsolete modules have been archived or removed.
- ‚úÖ **Pipeline Upgrade Strategy**: Clear plan for integrating supporting modules.

### **Immediate Technical Debt to Resolve**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Import Path Issues**: Enhanced analysis pipeline blocked by `PYTHONPATH=src` requirements. This is the #1 technical priority.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pipeline Integration**: The supporting modules must be integrated into the orchestrator script.

### **Strategic Position Assessment**
- **Infrastructure**: ‚úÖ **AHEAD OF PLAN** - Major architectural breakthrough achieved.
- **Academic Validation Readiness**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CORE READY** - Framework integration working, but pipeline requires integration work and import fixes.
- **Expert Consultation**: ‚úÖ **READY** - Working MFT integration available for demonstration.
- **Publication Pipeline**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PENDING** - Requires integration work and import path resolution.

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (June 20-27, 2025)**

### **Priority 1: Integrate Supporting Modules** ‚ö° **CRITICAL**
- Modify `comprehensive_experiment_orchestrator.py` to incorporate the pre-flight, execution, and post-processing steps outlined in the `production_pipeline_upgrade_proposal.md`.

### **Priority 2: Resolve Import Path Technical Debt** üéØ
```bash
# This remains a key blocker for the post-processing part of the pipeline.
# The following scripts need to be callable from the main orchestrator.
- scripts/extract_experiment_results.py
- scripts/statistical_hypothesis_testing.py
- scripts/interrater_reliability_analysis.py
- scripts/generate_comprehensive_visualizations.py
```

### **Priority 3: Leverage Architectural Breakthrough for Academic Validation** üìä
- **Immediate Action**: Use working framework integration for expert consultation outreach.
- **Demonstration Ready**: MFT framework architecture operational for Haidt lab demonstration.
- **Technical Capability**: Multi-LLM connections proven and cost-controlled.
- **Strategic Position**: Infrastructure advantage over anticipated timeline.

### **Strategic Recommendation** 
**Execute pipeline integration and technical debt resolution in parallel.** The core orchestrator can be modified to call the supporting modules, while the import path issues preventing the *post-processing* scripts from running can be fixed concurrently. This allows us to advance on all fronts.
