*Priority: CRITICAL - Foundation Infrastructure for Academic Credibility*

## **🎯 Today's Primary Focus**
Implement unified asset management architecture as foundation for disciplined, defensible, replicable, and auditable research capabilities. This infrastructure is prerequisite for credible academic validation.

## **📋 ITERATION CONTEXT**
- **Current Iteration**: Discernus MVP Academic Validation (June-September 2025)
- **Current Phase**: **Phase 0: Unified Asset Management Foundation** (Week 1-4)
- **Current Week**: **Week 1: Asset Architecture Implementation** 
- **Strategic Goal**: Build disciplined, defensible, replicable, and auditable research infrastructure

## **🧠 PRIMARY FOCUS: Unified Asset Management Architecture**

### **1. Framework YAML Conversion & MFT Implementation** ⏰ **URGENT - 3 hours**
**Context**: Convert existing frameworks to YAML format and complete theoretically accurate MFT framework

**Specific Tasks**:
- [ ] **Complete MFT Framework Validation**
  - ✅ Validate existing `moral_foundations_theory` framework with proper dipole structure
  - Test framework loading with production systems
  - Document theoretical accuracy vs Haidt literature
  - Prepare for expert consultation readiness

- [ ] **Convert Priority Frameworks to YAML**
  - ✅ Convert `iditi/framework.json` → `iditi/framework.yaml` (COMPLETED)
  - ✅ Convert `three_wells_political/framework.json` → `three_wells_political/framework.yaml` (COMPLETED)
  - **STRATEGIC FOCUS**: Dipole (MFT) + Non-dipole (Three Wells) for comparative validation
  - **DEFERRED**: civic_virtue, business_ethics, and other legacy frameworks to later iteration

- [ ] **Framework Directory Structure Standardization**
  ```
  frameworks/
  ├── moral_foundations_theory/
  │   ├── framework.yaml           # ✅ Completed  
  │   ├── README.md               # Academic documentation
  │   └── iterations/             # Development history
  ├── civic_virtue/
  │   ├── framework.yaml          # 🔄 Convert from JSON
  │   └── README.md
  └── [other frameworks...]
  ```

**Success Criteria**: ✅ MFT + IDITI + Three Wells frameworks in unified YAML format for comparative validation experiments (ACHIEVED)

### **2. Prompt Template Development Workspace** ⏰ **URGENT - 2 hours**
**Context**: Create systematic prompt template management separate from frameworks

  │   ├── README.md              # Usage documentation  
  │   └── iterations/            # Development history
  ├── direct_analysis/
  │   ├── template.yaml
  │   └── README.md
  └── comparative_analysis/
      ├── template.yaml
      └── README.md
  ```

**Specific Tasks**:
- [ ] **Universal Asset Ingestion Pipeline Design**
  ```python
  class UnifiedAssetIngestion:
      """Extend corpus pattern to all asset types"""
      
      def ingest_framework(self, development_path: Path) -> AssetStorageResult:
          # Calculate content hash using same method as corpus
          content_hash = self._calculate_asset_hash(development_path)
          
          # Create content-addressable storage
          storage_path = self._create_hash_storage(content_hash, development_path)
          
          # Register in database with provenance
          asset_id = self._register_asset(storage_path, content_hash)
  ```

- [ ] **Asset Storage Directory Structure Planning**
  ```
  asset_storage/
  ├── frameworks/
  │   ├── a7/f3/a7f3d8e2bc4a1509.../ # MFT framework
  │   ├── b1/c2/b1c2d3e4a5b6c7d8.../ # Civic Virtue framework  
  │   └── c4/d5/c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1.../ # IDITI framework
  ├── prompt_templates/
  │   ├── e8/f9/e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5.../ # Hierarchical analysis
  │   └── g2/h3/g2h3i4j5k6l7m8n9.../ # Direct analysis
  └── weighting_schemes/
      └── k6/l7/k6l7m8n9o0p1q2r3.../  # Winner-take-most
  ```

- [ ] **Database Schema Extensions**
  - Design `asset_versions` table for universal asset tracking
  - Create `asset_provenance` table for development lineage
  - Plan migration from current framework storage to unified system
  - Test hash-based lookups and integrity verification

**Success Criteria**: Complete design for content-addressable storage extending corpus pattern

  ```python
  class ExperimentAssetResolver:
      """Resolve semantic asset references to hash-based storage"""
      
      def resolve_experiment_assets(self, experiment_config: Dict) -> ResolvedAssets:
          # Convert semantic names to content hashes
          # Verify integrity of referenced assets
          # Load asset content from hash-based storage
          # Return resolved assets for experiment execution
  ```

**Success Criteria**: Two-tier architecture enabling both human development and machine execution

### **5. Academic Audit Trail Implementation** 📚 **MEDIUM PRIORITY - 1 hour**
