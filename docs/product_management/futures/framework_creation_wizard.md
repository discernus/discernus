# Framework Creation Wizard - Strategic Vision

**Status**: Future Enhancement  
**Timeline**: 3-6 months post-core platform completion  
**Strategic Impact**: Democratize framework development for non-technical researchers

## üéØ Vision Overview

Transform framework development from a technical, expert-level process into an accessible, guided experience that enables any researcher to create sophisticated analytical frameworks without deep technical knowledge.

## üöÄ Core Concept

### Interactive Framework Development
**Problem**: Creating custom frameworks currently requires deep technical knowledge of JSON schemas, theoretical grounding, and system architecture.

**Solution**: Guided, interactive wizard that walks users through framework creation with intelligent suggestions, validation, and best practices.

```bash
# Proposed interface
python create_framework.py environmental_ethics

# Guided prompts for:
# - Dipole definitions with theoretical grounding
# - Language cue suggestions based on domain literature
# - Well positioning guidance with visual preview
# - Weight optimization tips with performance prediction
# - Academic validation requirements
```
