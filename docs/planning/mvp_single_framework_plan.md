# Discernus Single Framework MVP Implementation Plan
**Moral Foundations Theory as Proof-of-Concept for Platform Viability**

*Date: December 2024*  
*Status: Focused MVP Strategy*  
*Approach: Single Framework End-to-End Validation*

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a focused implementation strategy that starts with a single established framework (Moral Foundations Theory) to demonstrate Discernus's core value proposition before expanding to multiple frameworks. This approach dramatically reduces complexity while providing a complete proof-of-concept that can attract academic adoption and validate the methodological approach.

**Core Strategy**: Prove the concept works excellently with one framework before adding complexity  
**Primary Goal**: End-to-end validation of Discernus approach using Moral Foundations Theory  
**Success Criteria**: Academic publication, expert endorsement, community adoption of single-framework implementation

## Conclusion

This MVP approach dramatically reduces risk while maintaining the core value proposition of Discernus as methodological infrastructure. By proving the concept works excellently with one established framework, we create a solid foundation for expansion while generating immediate academic value and community adoption.

The single-framework approach addresses the current platform gaps systematically while building credibility through expert collaboration and rigorous validation. Success with MFT provides proof-of-concept for the broader vision while creating sustainable momentum for long-term platform development.

**Next Action**: Begin Phase 1 implementation focusing on getting MFT analysis pipeline working end-to-end with current platform infrastructure.
