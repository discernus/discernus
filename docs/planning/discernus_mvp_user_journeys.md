*Status: Strategic User Journey Mapping*  
*Focus: MVP-Critical Personas and Validation-First Approach*

---

## Journey Overview

This document maps detailed user journeys for the three MVP-critical personas as they engage with Discernus during the validation phase. Each journey follows a 6-8 week timeline focused on establishing academic credibility through rigorous validation of Moral Foundations Theory implementation.

**Strategic Focus**: Validation of established frameworks rather than novel framework development  
**Primary Goal**: Academic credibility and expert endorsement leading to publication  
**Success Criteria**: Expert approval, statistical validation, community adoption

## Journey 1: Dr. Sarah Chen - Validation Researcher
**From Conference Discovery to Collaborative Validation Study**

Dr. Sarah Chen returns from the Computational Social Science Society conference where she heard whispers about a new platform for systematic framework analysis. As a tenure-track professor specializing in political communication, she needs methodologically rigorous tools that can withstand peer review. Her next six weeks will determine whether Discernus can support her research program.

### **Week 1: Platform Discovery and Initial Assessment**

Sarah opens the Discernus platform URL she scribbled at the conference. She's immediately drawn to the validation evidence prominently displayed:

- MFT implementation correlation with MFQ-30: r=0.83 (n=500)
- Inter-LLM reliability: r=0.91 (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- Expert consultation: "Reviewed and approved by Jonathan Haidt lab"

The rigorous approach surprises her—this isn't another AI tool making inflated claims, but systematic academic methodology.

### **Week 2: Pilot Testing and Academic Integration**

Sarah trains her graduate student on Discernus MFT analysis using their existing corpus of campaign speeches. The learning curve is minimal—the interface is designed for researchers, not technologists.

### **Week 3: Collaborative Research Planning**

Sarah designs a systematic validation study comparing Discernus MFT analysis with human expert coding. She develops IRB protocols for a study involving 100 political texts coded by both Discernus and expert human coders.

### **Week 4: Data Collection and Analysis**

The validation data reveals that Discernus consistently outperforms human coders on consistency (lower variance) while maintaining equivalent accuracy. The human-computer correlation reaches r=0.82, exceeding her success threshold.

### **Week 5: Academic Documentation and Collaboration**

Sarah writes the methodology section for her paper, describing Discernus MFT validation in detail. She reaches out to the Discernus development team requesting collaboration on a methodological paper.

### **Week 6: Publication and Community Building**

Sarah finalizes her paper incorporating Discernus methodology. She develops curriculum materials teaching MFT analysis using Discernus for next-generation computational social scientists.

**Strategic Outcome**: Sarah transforms from skeptical evaluator to validated adopter and academic advocate, providing crucial early academic credibility for Discernus platform adoption.

## Journey 2: Independent Research Author - Platform Developer
**From Prototype to Validated Academic Infrastructure**

The Independent Research Author faces a critical six-week period determining whether months of development work can achieve academic credibility. The goal: transform Discernus from research prototype to validated academic infrastructure worthy of publication and community adoption.

### **Week 1: Expert Consultation Initiation**

The researcher crafts detailed outreach to Jonathan Haidt's lab, approaching as academic collaboration rather than endorsement request. Complete MFT implementation documentation and preliminary validation results (r=0.78 in pilot) are prepared.

### **Week 2: Framework Validation Infrastructure**

The researcher designs systematic validation comparing Discernus MFT outputs with MFQ-30 responses (n=500 participants). Cross-LLM reliability testing reveals inter-LLM consistency (r=0.91 between GPT-4 and Claude).

### **Week 3: Expert Feedback Integration**

The Haidt lab provides detailed feedback: "Highly faithful to MFT theory" with methodological suggestions for enhanced lexical markers. Validation study approval: "Design appropriate for academic publication."

### **Week 4: Validation Execution and Analysis**

Comprehensive statistical analysis reveals strong validation with overall correlation r=0.83 (p<0.001) and foundation-specific correlations ranging from r=0.78 to r=0.89.

### **Week 5: Academic Documentation and Publication**

With validation complete and expert approval, the researcher drafts academic paper: "Systematic Framework Validation for Computational Text Analysis: The Discernus Platform" with Jonathan Haidt as co-author.

### **Week 6: Publication and Platform Launch**

Discernus launches publicly with validated MFT implementation, academic documentation prominent, expert endorsement clearly attributed, and research-grade reliability standards.

**Strategic Outcome**: Transformation from research prototype to academically validated platform with expert endorsement and publication pathway established.

## Journey 3: Dr. Jonathan Haidt - Framework Originator
**From Initial Skepticism to Academic Endorsement**

Dr. Jonathan Haidt receives an email requesting consultation on computational implementation of Moral Foundations Theory. As the framework originator, he's seen numerous attempts to operationalize MFT computationally—most oversimplify or misrepresent the theory.

### **Week 1: Initial Assessment and Skeptical Evaluation**

Haidt receives detailed documentation showing unusual sophistication: foundation-specific lexicons derived from validated MFT research, prompt templates that capture theoretical nuances, and scoring protocols that avoid common MFT misinterpretations.

### **Week 2: Detailed Implementation Feedback**

Haidt provides detailed feedback on each foundation implementation, from Care/Harm ("accurately capture care vs. harm distinction") to Sanctity/Degradation ("most challenging foundation operationalized well").

### **Week 3: Validation Study Oversight**

After reviewing implementation refinements, Haidt provides final approval for validation study with formal endorsement for proceeding with full validation.

### **Week 4: Statistical Validation and Academic Standards**

Haidt reviews final validation results showing foundation-specific correlations with MFQ-30 ranging from r=0.78 to r=0.89, all p<0.001. Academic judgment: "Methodology suitable for top-tier journal publication."

### **Week 5: Academic Endorsement and Collaboration**

Haidt provides formal academic endorsement and agrees to co-author methodology paper: "Validated Computational Implementation of Moral Foundations Theory."

### **Week 6: Academic Integration and Future Collaboration**

Haidt establishes ongoing collaboration including quarterly consultation on Discernus MFT refinements and joint grant proposals for computational psychology research.

**Strategic Outcome**: Haidt transforms from skeptical evaluator to academic collaborator and endorser, providing crucial credibility for Discernus academic adoption.

## Cross-Journey Success Patterns

### **Common Success Factors**
1. **Academic Rigor**: All journeys emphasize statistical validation and methodological thoroughness
2. **Expert Collaboration**: Genuine partnership rather than superficial endorsement
3. **Systematic Evidence**: Comprehensive validation evidence supporting academic claims
4. **Community Building**: Academic network effects amplifying platform credibility

### **Validation Success Metrics**
- **Statistical**: r>0.8 correlation with established measures
- **Expert**: Formal endorsement from framework originators
