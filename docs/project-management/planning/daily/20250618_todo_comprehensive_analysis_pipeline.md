## 🚨 **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**Problem**: Database architecture confusion - multiple sources of truth
- **Production Database**: Used by orchestrator for component registration, experiments table
- **StatisticalLogger**: Separate database system for runs/jobs data storage
- **Result**: IDITI experiment succeeded but data not in StatisticalLogger database
- **Root Cause**: Orchestrator and StatisticalLogger are disconnected systems

**Impact**: 
- Successful experiments (IDITI 8/8 analyses, $0.0915 cost) have no database records
- Enhanced analysis pipeline expects StatisticalLogger data format
- Data extraction scripts query StatisticalLogger, not production database
- Confusion about which system is source of truth for experiment results

**Next Steps** (for fresh conversation):
1. **Architectural Analysis**: Map current database systems and data flows
2. **Unified Storage Design**: Design single source of truth for experiment results  
3. **Integration Fix**: Connect orchestrator execution to proper database storage
4. **Data Migration**: Ensure IDITI and future experiments stored correctly
5. **System Verification**: Run complete end-to-end test with database validation

**Files Needing Investigation**:
- `src/narrative_gravity/utils/statistical_logger.py` - Current logging system
- `scripts/comprehensive_experiment_orchestrator.py` - Orchestrator data flow
- `src/narrative_gravity/models/` - Production database models
- Database schema documentation and migration files

**Goal**: Single, unified experiment data storage system with clear data flow from orchestrator → database → analysis pipeline
