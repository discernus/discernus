*Date: June 17, 2025*
*Priority: HIGH - Critical Implementation Day*
*Status: PLANNING → EXECUTION → **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED**

- ✅ **Statistical hypothesis testing**: Complete H1, H2, H3 validation system implemented and tested with real IDITI data
- ✅ **Interrater reliability analysis**: ICC, Cronbach's Alpha, systematic bias detection - all working
- ✅ **Comprehensive visualizations**: 7 different visualization types including interactive dashboard
- ✅ **End-to-end pipeline**: Complete data flow from orchestrator → analysis → visualization → results
- ✅ **EXPERIMENT ORGANIZATION SYSTEM**: Complete unified experiment package structure implemented!
  - ✅ **Self-contained packages**: `experiments/` directory with standardized structure
  - ✅ **IDITI experiment organized**: Complete package with inputs, outputs, analysis, documentation, metadata
  - ✅ **Experiment generator**: `create_experiment_package.py` script for standardized packages
  - ✅ **Full reproducibility**: Each package contains everything needed for exact reproduction
  - ✅ **Legacy cleanup**: All old scattered experiment files archived to `archive/legacy_experiment_reports_pre_unified_structure/`

- 🔄 **Multi-LLM reliability study**: Execute 3-LLM × 8-text = 24 analyses for reliability assessment
- 🔄 **Human rater study framework**: Design and documentation for LLM-human validation

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**Problem**: Database architecture confusion - multiple sources of truth
- **Production Database**: Used by orchestrator for component registration, experiments table
- **StatisticalLogger**: Separate database system for runs/jobs data storage
- **Result**: IDITI experiment succeeded but data not in StatisticalLogger database
- **Root Cause**: Orchestrator and StatisticalLogger are disconnected systems

**Impact**: 
- Successful experiments (IDITI 8/8 analyses, $0.0915 cost) have no database records
- Enhanced analysis pipeline expects StatisticalLogger data format
- Data extraction scripts query StatisticalLogger, not production database
- Confusion about which system is source of truth for experiment results

**Next Steps** (for fresh conversation):
1. **Architectural Analysis**: Map current database systems and data flows
2. **Unified Storage Design**: Design single source of truth for experiment results  
3. **Integration Fix**: Connect orchestrator execution to proper database storage
4. **Data Migration**: Ensure IDITI and future experiments stored correctly
5. **System Verification**: Run complete end-to-end test with database validation

**Files Needing Investigation**:
- `src/narrative_gravity/utils/statistical_logger.py` - Current logging system
- `scripts/comprehensive_experiment_orchestrator.py` - Orchestrator data flow
- `src/narrative_gravity/models/` - Production database models
- Database schema documentation and migration files

**Goal**: Single, unified experiment data storage system with clear data flow from orchestrator → database → analysis pipeline
