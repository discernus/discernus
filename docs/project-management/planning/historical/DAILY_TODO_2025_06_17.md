- 🔒 **Statistical Significance Enforcement**: P-value, confidence interval, sample size validation
- 🔒 **LLM Response Quality Assessment**: Length, coherence, completeness validation
- 🔒 **Analysis Variance Monitoring**: Coefficient of variation thresholds
- 🔒 **Quality Threshold Configuration**: Customizable standards for different experiment types

### **✅ Comprehensive Architecture Documentation** ✅ COMPLETE
- 📚 **Complete Architecture Document**: `docs/platform-development/architecture/TRANSACTION_INTEGRITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- 📚 **5-Phase Deployment Strategy**: Foundation → Core Validation → Pipeline Safety → Compliance → Advanced Features
- 📚 **Integration Patterns**: Common transaction manager interface and orchestrator coordination
- 📚 **Error Handling Hierarchy**: Structured exception handling with domain-specific guidance
