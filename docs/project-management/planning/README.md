## **Benefits of This Organization**

### **🎯 Focus**
- **Daily work**: Look in `active/` and `daily/`
- **Planning sessions**: Look in `strategic/`
- **Reference**: Check `historical/` and `iterations/`

### **📚 Clarity**
- **Tactical** (daily todos) vs **Strategic** (deliverables, roadmaps)
- **Current** (active) vs **Historical** (completed iterations)
- **General** (active work) vs **Specialized** (domain-specific)

### **🗄️ Archive Management**
- Completed iterations automatically archived with date structure
- Historical files preserved but out of daily workflow
- Specialized planning isolated but accessible

This organization supports the current workflow while scaling for future growth and complexity.
