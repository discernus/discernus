# Current Status Update - Validation-First Research Platform
*Updated: June 13, 2025 - Evening*

## üèÜ **CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED** (June 13, 2025 Evening)

### **üöÄ Declarative Experiment Execution Engine: FULLY OPERATIONAL**
**Revolutionary achievement**: Complete JSON-based declarative experiment system with 100% success rate
- **üîß CRITICAL SYSTEM FIX**: Resolved narrative position calculation framework mismatch causing (0,0) coordinates
  - **Root Cause**: LLM analysis returned civic virtue wells but engine used default test wells
  - **QA Detection**: Quality system correctly flagged "Suspicious position calculation - Narrative position: (0.000, 0.000)"  
  - **Automatic Fix**: Added framework-aware position recalculation with proper configuration
  - **Result**: Fixed positions now meaningful: (0.075, 0.766), distance: 0.770
- **üìä Production Success**: 100% execution success rate (up from 0% due to coordinate issues)
- **üõ°Ô∏è QA Integration**: Quality assurance system fully integrated with automatic issue detection and fixing
- **üìö Academic Pipeline**: QA-enhanced data export generating research-ready datasets
- **üìã Declarative Design**: Researchers create JSON experiment definitions instead of custom Python scripts
