# Experiment Specification (v7.0)

**Version**: 7.0  
**Status**: Active  
**Major Change**: Gasket Architecture Integration and Raw Analysis Log Workflow

The `experiment.md` file is a simple, human-readable YAML file that defines the complete scope of an analysis run. It acts as the **single source of truth** for experiment configuration, telling the Discernus system what framework to use, what corpus to analyze, and how to run it.

**ðŸš€ NEW IN V7.0: Gasket Architecture Workflow**

Version 7.0 aligns with Framework Specification v7.0 and Corpus Specification v7.0 to support the complete gasket architecture workflow: Raw Analysis Log â†’ Intelligent Extractor â†’ Mathematical Processing â†’ Evidence Distillation â†’ Human-Readable Results.

---

## 1. File Structure

The experiment file MUST be a valid YAML file named `experiment.md` containing a YAML configuration block with the header `# --- Discernus Configuration ---`.

---

## 2. Recommended Project Structure

The system uses a **single-source-of-truth** architecture where the experiment file defines all paths and configuration:

```
my_research_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ framework.md                  # Framework v7.0 with gasket_schema
â”œâ”€â”€ experiment.md                 # Experiment v7.0 with gasket workflow
â””â”€â”€ corpus/                       # Corpus v7.0 with enhanced manifest
    â”œâ”€â”€ corpus.md                 # Corpus specification compliance
    â”œâ”€â”€ document_01.txt
    â”œâ”€â”€ document_02.txt
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

To run an experiment, execute the CLI with a single parameter:

```bash
python3 -m discernus.cli run experiment.md
```

The experiment file defines the framework and corpus paths, eliminating parameter conflicts.
