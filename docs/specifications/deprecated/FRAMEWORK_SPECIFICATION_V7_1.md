# Framework Specification (v7.1)

**Version**: 7.1  
**Status**: Active  
**Major Change**: Enhanced Gasket Schema with Metadata Scores and Advanced Extraction Patterns

A Discernus framework is a self-contained markdown file that embodies the core principles of computational social science research. It serves as both human-readable methodology and machine-executable instructions, ensuring perfect coherence between theory and practice.

**üöÄ V7.1 ENHANCEMENT: Metadata-Rich Gasket Architecture**

Version 7.1 builds upon the v7.0 Raw Analysis Log paradigm with enhanced gasket schema capabilities:
- **Metadata Scores**: Salience and confidence scores for dimension importance and analyst certainty
- **Advanced Extraction Patterns**: Regex-based pattern matching with fallback strategies
- **Framework-Specific Validation**: Customizable validation rules and error handling
- **Enhanced Data Quality**: Comprehensive metadata for academic-grade provenance

**‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGE: No Backward Compatibility**

Version 7.1 does NOT maintain backward compatibility with v5.0/v6.0/v7.0 frameworks. All frameworks must be upgraded to v7.1 specification. This is a clean architectural break to establish a single, enhanced standard.

## Terminology Glossary

To ensure consistency across all frameworks, these terms have specific meanings:

**Framework**: The complete analytical system including theory, methodology, and implementation.
**Dimension**: Individual measurable element that receives a 0.0-1.0 score (e.g., Fear, Hope).
**Analysis Variant**: Different analytical approaches within the same framework (e.g., a "default" full version vs. a "descriptive_only" simplified version).
**Raw Analysis Log**: Single, human-readable text block containing scores, evidence, and reasoning from the Analysis Agent.
**üÜï Metadata Scores**: Salience (0.0-1.0) and confidence (0.0-1.0) scores that provide additional context for each dimension.
**üÜï Enhanced Gasket Schema**: Advanced configuration for the Intelligent Extractor with regex patterns, validation rules, and fallback strategies.
**üÜï Extraction Patterns**: Regex patterns that enable flexible, robust extraction of scores and metadata from Raw Analysis Logs.

## Framework Size and Performance Guidelines

### Character Limit Policy

**Maximum Framework Size**: 30,000 characters (30KB)

**Rationale**: Framework quality and comprehensiveness are prioritized over size constraints. The v7.1 enhanced gasket architecture provides sophisticated extraction capabilities while maintaining analytical rigor.

**Validation**: The system enforces this limit during experiment ingest.

### Evidence Optimization Notice

**System Behavior**: The analysis agent is optimized for synthesis efficiency and will automatically limit evidence to the strongest 1-2 quotes per dimension.

**Framework Authors**: Design your evidence requirements around **quality over quantity**.

---

## Part I: Core Principles

1.  **The THIN Philosophy**: LLMs do intelligence, software does infrastructure. Your framework contains the domain-specific intelligence; the enhanced gasket architecture handles the interfaces.
2.  **Documentation-Execution Coherence**: What you promise in the documentation must exactly match what you deliver in the executable prompt.
3.  **Human Expert Simulation**: Write prompts like you're briefing a brilliant colleague, not like you're programming a data entry system.
4.  **Epistemic Integrity**: Every analytical decision must be traceable. Scores without evidence are meaningless.
5.  **Synthesis Efficiency**: Balance analytical rigor with synthesis efficiency. Focus on the strongest evidence.
6.  **Raw Analysis Log Paradigm**: Analysis Agents produce natural, human-readable analysis logs instead of complex structured data.
7.  **Mathematical Separation**: Analysis agents provide ONLY raw scores, evidence, and reasoning. All mathematical calculations are performed by explicit, auditable code in the synthesis pipeline.
8.  **üÜï Enhanced Gasket Architecture**: Advanced gasket schema with metadata scores, extraction patterns, and validation rules.
9.  **üÜï Metadata-Rich Analysis**: Salience and confidence scores provide academic-grade context for all dimensions.
10. **üÜï Robust Extraction**: Multiple regex patterns and fallback strategies ensure reliable data extraction across diverse analytical styles.

## Part II: Technical Implementation

### 1. File Structure

A framework file is a standard Markdown (`.md`) file containing:
1.  **The Narrative**: The human-readable explanation of the framework's theory, methodology, and quality standards.
2.  **The Appendix**: A single, collapsible appendix (`<details>...<\/details>`) containing a single JSON code block. This is the **single source of truth for execution** and includes the enhanced gasket_schema for Intelligent Extractor configuration.

### 2. The JSON Appendix: The Single Source of Truth

## Part III: Enhanced Gasket Schema (v7.1)

### 1. Metadata Scores

**Salience Score (0.0-1.0)**: Measures the importance or relevance of a dimension within the specific text being analyzed.
- **1.0**: Central theme, extensively discussed
- **0.5**: Moderately present, some discussion
- **0.0**: Barely mentioned or absent

**Confidence Score (0.0-1.0)**: Measures the analyst's certainty in their dimensional assessment.
- **1.0**: Very confident, clear textual evidence
- **0.5**: Moderately confident, some ambiguity
- **0.0**: Low confidence, limited or unclear evidence

### 2. Advanced Extraction Patterns

**Regex Pattern Structure**: Flexible patterns that accommodate natural language variation:
```json
"extraction_patterns": {
  "dimension_score": [
    "dimension.{0,20}score",           // Primary pattern
    "dim.{0,20}score",                 // Abbreviation pattern  
    "dimension.{0,20}rating"           // Alternative terminology
  ]
}
```

**Pattern Matching Strategy**:
1. **Primary Pattern**: Most specific, preferred extraction
2. **Fallback Patterns**: Alternative patterns for robustness
3. **Flexible Spacing**: `{0,20}` allows natural language spacing

### 3. Validation Rules

**Required Fields**: Minimum dimensions that must be extracted for valid analysis.
**Score Ranges**: Numerical bounds for all extracted values.
**Metadata Ranges**: Separate validation for salience and confidence scores.
**Fallback Strategy**: Behavior when extraction fails (use defaults, retry, or error).

### 4. Framework-Specific Configuration

Each framework can customize:
- **Extraction Patterns**: Domain-specific terminology and patterns
- **Validation Rules**: Framework-appropriate requirements
- **Metadata Requirements**: Whether salience/confidence are required or optional
- **Fallback Behavior**: How to handle extraction failures

---

## Part IV: Analysis Prompt Requirements

### 1. Natural Language Analysis

**Primary Output**: Human-readable analysis with clear reasoning and evidence.
**Score Integration**: Numerical scores embedded naturally within analytical text.
**Evidence Support**: Direct quotes with clear justification for each score.

### 2. Metadata Score Requirements

**Salience Reporting**: For each dimension, report its importance in this specific text.
**Confidence Reporting**: For each dimension, report your certainty in the assessment.
**Natural Integration**: Metadata scores should flow naturally within the analysis, not as separate data points.

### 3. Example Output Structure

```
This text demonstrates strong populist rhetoric (populism score: 0.8, salience: 0.9, confidence: 0.7) 
with frequent appeals to "the people" versus "the establishment." The populist dimension is highly 
salient in this speech, appearing throughout multiple sections, though some passages are ambiguous 
in their anti-elite framing, reducing my confidence slightly.

The nationalism dimension shows moderate presence (nationalism score: 0.4, salience: 0.3, confidence: 0.8) 
with limited cultural supremacy language. While the few nationalist appeals are clear and 
unambiguous, the dimension is not central to this particular text.
```
