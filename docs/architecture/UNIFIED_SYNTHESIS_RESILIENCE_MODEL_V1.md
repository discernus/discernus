# Unified Synthesis Resilience Model v1.0

**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Design Phase  
**Epic**: #217 CSV-to-JSON Migration  
**Purpose**: Replace dual-paradigm architecture with internal resilience model

---

## Executive Summary

The current system maintains a hidden architectural duality: a primary `ProductionThinSynthesisPipeline` (auditable, code-generated) with a fallback to `EnhancedSynthesisAgent` (black box LLM calculations). This dual-paradigm poses research integrity risks by concealing non-auditable processes behind a veneer of completion.

**Solution**: Design a multi-layered resilience model *within* the unified pipeline that handles failures without resorting to non-auditable fallbacks.

---

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Primary Path: ProductionThinSynthesisPipeline
```
Stage 1: AnalyticalCodeGenerator → Python code
Stage 2: SecureCodeExecutor → Statistical results  
Stage 3: EvidenceCurator → Curated evidence
Stage 4: ResultsInterpreter → Final narrative
```

### Current Failure Modes

**Stage 1 - Code Generation Failures:**
- LLM generates syntactically invalid Python
- LLM generates code incompatible with data structure
- LLM generates code that violates security policies
- Context window exceeded with complex frameworks

**Stage 2 - Code Execution Failures:**
- Runtime errors in generated code
- Timeout errors (>300 seconds)
- Memory limit exceeded (>512MB)  
- Data format mismatches (CSV structure assumptions)

**Stage 3 - Evidence Curation Failures:**
- LLM fails to parse statistical results
- LLM returns malformed evidence structure
- Evidence confidence thresholds not met
- Context window exceeded with large result sets

**Stage 4 - Results Interpretation Failures:**
- LLM fails to synthesize coherent narrative
- LLM returns incomplete or malformed response
- Statistical summary generation fails
- Word count/quality thresholds not met

### Legacy Fallback Risk
Currently, any pipeline failure triggers (or could trigger) fallback to `EnhancedSynthesisAgent`, which:
- Performs all mathematical calculations via LLM (non-auditable)
- Provides no separation between analysis and computation
- Creates "synthesis succeeded" illusion while compromising research integrity

## Unified Resilience Model Design

### Core Principle: **Graduated Degradation Within Auditable Boundaries**

Instead of falling back to a non-auditable process, implement multiple resilience layers *within* the unified pipeline that maintain auditability while handling failures gracefully.

### Layer 1: Proactive Failure Prevention

**Code Generation Resilience:**
- **Template-Based Fallback**: If LLM generates invalid code, fall back to pre-validated code templates for common framework patterns
- **Syntax Validation**: Parse and validate generated code before execution
- **Security Pre-Check**: Validate against security policies before execution
- **Complexity Reduction**: If context window exceeded, generate simplified analysis focusing on core dimensions

**Data Format Resilience:**
- **Adaptive Data Loading**: Support both CSV and JSON input formats automatically
- **Schema Validation**: Validate data structure before code generation
- **Missing Data Handling**: Generate code that gracefully handles missing dimensions/evidence

### Layer 2: Execution-Time Recovery

**Code Execution Resilience:**
- **Syntax Error Recovery**: If code fails, attempt automatic fixes (common patterns like missing imports, typos)
- **Timeout Handling**: If execution exceeds limits, generate simplified analysis with reduced computational complexity
- **Memory Management**: If memory exceeded, process data in smaller chunks
- **Graceful Degradation**: If complex statistics fail, fall back to basic descriptive statistics

**Evidence Processing Resilience:**
- **Evidence Threshold Adjustment**: If evidence quality too low, progressively lower thresholds
- **Alternative Evidence Sources**: If primary evidence insufficient, use secondary evidence types
- **Partial Evidence Acceptance**: Accept partial evidence sets rather than complete failure

### Layer 3: Output Quality Assurance

**Results Interpretation Resilience:**
- **Narrative Simplification**: If complex synthesis fails, generate simplified but complete report
- **Modular Reporting**: If full report fails, generate section-by-section reports
- **Quality Validation**: Validate output completeness and retry with adjusted parameters if needed
- **Baseline Report Generation**: If all else fails, generate basic statistical summary with evidence

### Layer 4: Auditable Partial Success

**Principle**: Better to deliver a complete, auditable analysis with reduced complexity than to fall back to non-auditable processes.

**Partial Success Modes:**
- **Simplified Statistical Analysis**: Basic descriptive statistics instead of complex modeling
- **Reduced Evidence Integration**: Core evidence instead of comprehensive curation  
- **Streamlined Narrative**: Clear, factual reporting instead of complex synthesis
- **Transparent Limitations**: Explicit documentation of what was simplified and why

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhanced Error Handling (1 week)

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive error capture and classification

**Tasks:**
1. **Error Classification System**: Categorize failures by type and stage
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed error context for each failure mode
3. **Failure Analysis**: Track which failures are recoverable vs. terminal
4. **Baseline Metrics**: Establish current failure rates by category

### Phase 2: Template-Based Fallbacks (1 week)

**Objective**: Implement pre-validated code templates for common failures

**Tasks:**
1. **Code Template Library**: Create validated templates for common framework patterns
2. **Template Selection Logic**: Match failed code generation to appropriate templates
3. **Template Validation**: Ensure all templates produce auditable results
4. **Template Testing**: Validate templates work with existing frameworks

### Phase 3: Execution Recovery (1 week)

**Objective**: Implement runtime failure recovery mechanisms

**Tasks:**
1. **Syntax Error Recovery**: Automatic fixes for common code generation errors
2. **Timeout Management**: Progressive complexity reduction for long-running analyses
3. **Memory Management**: Chunked processing for large datasets

- **Fallback**: Can halt at any phase if complexity becomes unmanageable

**Performance Risk**: Additional validation and recovery may slow synthesis
- **Mitigation**: Profile each resilience layer, optimize critical paths
- **Acceptance**: Slight performance reduction acceptable for reliability gain

**Quality Risk**: Graceful degradation might reduce analysis quality
- **Mitigation**: Set minimum quality thresholds, transparent limitation reporting
- **Principle**: Auditable simple analysis better than non-auditable complex analysis

### Operational Risks

**Maintenance Burden**: More failure modes to handle and test
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite, clear failure mode documentation
- **Investment**: One-time complexity increase for long-term reliability gain

**User Expectation**: Users might expect consistent high-quality outputs
- **Mitigation**: Clear communication about resilience model, transparent limitation reporting
- **Benefit**: Users prefer predictable partial success over random complete failures

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Auditable First
Every resilience mechanism must maintain complete auditability. No "magic" recovery that obscures process.

### 2. Graduated Response
Multiple layers of increasingly simplified but still complete analysis, never complete failure.

### 3. Transparent Limitations
All quality reductions, simplifications, or fallbacks explicitly documented in output.

### 4. Deterministic Recovery
Same failure conditions always trigger same recovery mechanisms for reproducibility.

### 5. Continuous Improvement
Failure modes and recovery effectiveness continuously monitored and improved.
