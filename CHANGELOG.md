### 🔒 Framework Transaction Integrity System - 2025-06-17

**TRANSACTION SAFETY: Framework Uncertainty = Experiment Failure + Rollback**

Implemented comprehensive framework transaction integrity system that treats framework validation uncertainty as a critical transaction failure requiring graceful termination and rollback.

**Core Philosophy:**
- **Framework Uncertainty = Experiment Invalid**: Any doubt about framework validity corrupts experiment results
- **Database Single Source of Truth**: Post-ingestion, database becomes authoritative source
- **Automatic Version Detection**: Framework content changes trigger automatic version increment
- **Transaction Safety**: Complete rollback capability protects against partial failures

**System Components:**

**1. Framework Transaction Manager** (`src/narrative_gravity/utils/framework_transaction_manager.py`):
- 🔒 **Transaction State Management**: Tracks framework validation across experiment lifecycle
- 🔒 **Database-First Loading**: Enforces database as single source of truth for production
- 🔒 **Content Change Detection**: SHA256 hashing detects framework content modifications
- 🔒 **Automatic Versioning**: Content changes auto-increment version numbers (v1.0.1 → v1.0.2)
- 🔒 **Rollback Capability**: Removes framework versions created during failed transactions

**2. Enhanced Orchestrator Integration** (`scripts/production/comprehensive_experiment_orchestrator.py`):
- 🔒 **Pre-Flight Framework Validation**: Mandatory framework transaction integrity check
- 🔒 **Graceful Failure Handling**: `FrameworkTransactionIntegrityError` with detailed guidance
- 🔒 **User Guidance Generation**: Specific commands and recommendations for fixing issues
- 🔒 **Database Consistency**: Framework transaction failures recorded with full audit trail

**Validation Flow:**
1. **Database Check**: Load framework from FrameworkVersion table (single source of truth)
2. **File Consistency**: If file provided, validate content matches database hash
3. **Content Change Handling**: If content differs, auto-create new version
4. **Transaction Validation**: All frameworks must pass validation or experiment terminates
5. **Rollback on Failure**: Undo any framework changes made during failed transaction

**Error Scenarios & Handling:**

- **Framework Not Found**: Clear guidance to create and import framework definition
- **Version Mismatch**: Specific version discrepancy details and sync commands
- **Content Changed**: Automatic new version creation with content hash validation
- **Transaction Failure**: Complete rollback with step-by-step recovery instructions

**User Experience:**
```bash
🚨 EXPERIMENT TERMINATED: Framework Transaction Integrity Failure

Framework 'custom_framework' not found in database or filesystem

🔧 Recommended Actions:
• Create framework definition file: frameworks/custom_framework/framework_consolidated.json
• Import to database: python3 scripts/framework_sync.py import custom_framework
• Validate framework: python3 scripts/framework_sync.py validate custom_framework

🔒 Why This Matters:
• Framework uncertainty compromises experiment validity
• Database is the single source of truth for production
• Framework content changes require explicit versioning
• Transaction rollback protects against partial failures
```

**Integration Points:**
- **Analysis Service**: Updated to use database-first framework loading
- **Experiment Orchestrator**: Framework validation integrated into pre-flight checks
- **Framework Sync**: Enhanced version detection and conflict resolution
- **Database Models**: Full audit trail in FrameworkVersion table

**Validation Results:**
- ✅ Framework uncertainty triggers immediate experiment termination
- ✅ Database enforced as single source of truth for production systems
- ✅ Automatic version detection prevents silent framework drift
- ✅ Complete rollback capability protects experiment integrity
- ✅ Comprehensive user guidance accelerates issue resolution

**Impact:**
- **Experiment Integrity**: Prevents contaminated results from framework uncertainty
- **Production Safety**: Database single source of truth enforced consistently
- **Version Control**: Automatic framework versioning prevents configuration drift
- **Developer Experience**: Clear guidance reduces debugging time for framework issues
- **Transaction Safety**: Rollback capability ensures clean failure recovery

This system ensures that framework-related uncertainty cannot compromise experimental results, providing the transaction-level integrity required for reliable scientific analysis.

### 🔧 Framework Template Integration Fix - 2025-06-17

**ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRITY: Complete Framework-Template-Database Compliance**

Fixed critical framework boundary violations where raw LLM analysis was returning incorrect well counts. Implemented comprehensive architectural compliance from database through LLM analysis.

**Problem Identified:**
- IDITI framework defines 2 wells (Dignity, Tribalism) but raw analysis returned 10 wells
- Root cause 1: Hardcoded civic virtue wells in `RealAnalysisService` methods
- Root cause 2: Framework loading from filesystem instead of database single source of truth
- Analysis was framework-agnostic during LLM calls, then post-processed to fit framework

**Solution Implemented:**
- 🔒 **Single Source of Truth**: Database-first framework loading (`FrameworkVersion` table)
- 🔒 **Dynamic Framework Loading**: Added `_get_framework_wells()` method with comprehensive framework detection
- 🔒 **Eliminated Hardcoded Wells**: Removed all hardcoded well lists from analysis methods
- 🔒 **Source-Level Compliance**: Framework boundaries now enforced during prompt generation and response parsing
- 🔒 **Multi-Tier Fallback**: Database → Filesystem → Hardcoded mappings for robust operation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/narrative_gravity/api/analysis_service.py`: Complete framework compliance overhaul
  - `_get_framework_wells()`: Database-first dynamic well extraction
  - `_load_wells_from_database()`: Single source of truth framework loading
  - `_extract_scores_from_text()`: Framework-aware score extraction
  - `_normalize_scores_for_framework()`: Framework-aware score normalization  
  - `_generate_default_scores()`: Framework-specific default generation
  - `_generate_fallback_analysis()`: Framework-aware fallback analysis
  - `_extract_evidence_quotes()`: Framework-agnostic keyword extraction

**Validation Results:**
- ✅ IDITI correctly loads 2 wells from database: `✅ Loaded 2 wells from database for iditi`
- ✅ End-to-end testing confirms complete framework boundary compliance  
- ✅ Real LLM analysis with GPT-4 respects framework definitions ($0.0120 cost)
- ✅ All framework types (civic_virtue, mft_persuasive_force, iditi) work correctly
- ✅ Database single source of truth properly implemented

**Architectural Impact:**
- **Complete Integrity**: Database → Framework Loading → Template Generation → LLM Analysis 
- **Single Source of Truth**: Production systems load from database, development from filesystem
- **Framework Boundaries**: Raw analysis respects framework definitions at source
- **Data Quality**: Eliminates framework boundary violations in experimental results  
- **Template Compliance**: Ensures prompt templates are truly framework-specific
- **Experiment Validity**: IDITI experiments now architecturally compliant

This comprehensive fix resolves the disconnect between framework definitions, database storage, and actual LLM analysis, ensuring complete architectural compliance from the single source of truth through result generation.
