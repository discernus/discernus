## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a computational analysis of the constitutional health of presidential addresses to Congress from 1992 to 2025, utilizing the Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v10.0. The study analyzed 48 speeches across the administrations of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden. The primary finding is a statistically significant divergence in constitutional rhetoric during the Trump administration compared to all other modern presidencies. While administrations from Bush H.W. through Obama, and subsequently the Biden administration, demonstrated a consistent and high adherence to conventional constitutional discourse—characterized by respect for procedures, institutions, and systemic continuity—the Trump administration's rhetoric represents a radical and statistically significant departure.

Statistical analysis reveals that the mean Constitutional Health Index (CHI) for the Trump administration (M = -0.005, SD = 0.56) was significantly lower than all other administrations in the study (p < .001), which all maintained high positive scores. This difference is driven by a cohesive rhetorical style high in constitutional pathology (procedural rejection, institutional subversion, and systemic replacement), a pattern not observed in any other president. Furthermore, Levene's test confirmed the Trump administration's rhetoric exhibited significantly higher variance (p < .001), indicating a volatile mix of anti-constitutional attacks and moments of conventional constitutional respect. Euclidean distance and hierarchical clustering analyses confirm that the Trump administration's rhetorical profile is a distinct outlier, while all other modern administrations cluster together, suggesting a shared, conventional approach to constitutional governance.

The findings suggest that a stable norm of presidential constitutional rhetoric existed for decades, which was disrupted during the Trump presidency and has since seen a reversion under the Biden administration. The Constitutional Health Framework proved effective in quantifying these dynamics, with its health and pathology subscales demonstrating excellent (α = 0.946) and good (α = 0.886) internal consistency, respectively. This research provides empirical evidence of a significant shift in American presidential discourse and offers a robust methodology for monitoring the constitutional health of political communication.

## 2. Opening Framework: Key Insights

*   **The Trump administration's constitutional rhetoric is a statistically significant outlier.** A one-way ANOVA confirms a significant difference in Constitutional Health Index (CHI) across administrations (F(4, 39) = 13.84, p < .001). Post-hoc Tukey HSD tests reveal the Trump administration's mean CHI (M = -0.005) is significantly lower than that of Clinton (M = 0.84), Bush W. (M = 0.72), Obama (M = 0.76), and Biden (M = 0.66), with p < .001 for all comparisons.
*   **Anti-constitutional rhetoric forms a cohesive style.** The framework's pathology subscale (procedural rejection, institutional subversion, systemic replacement) demonstrates good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.886). This indicates that these three dimensions are not isolated attacks but components of a coherent rhetorical strategy, most prominently used by the Trump administration, which scored an order of magnitude higher on the Constitutional Pathology Index (M = 0.355) than any other.
*   **A stable, cross-party norm of high constitutional health existed pre-Trump.** From Bush H.W. (M = 0.87) to Obama (M = 0.76), Republican and Democratic administrations displayed statistically indistinguishable and consistently high CHI scores. This suggests a shared rhetorical convention of upholding procedural, institutional, and systemic norms in formal addresses.
*   **The Biden administration's rhetoric marks a return to the pre-Trump norm.** Euclidean distance analysis shows the Biden administration's rhetorical profile is far more similar to Obama (distance = 0.187) and Clinton (distance = 0.286) than to Trump (distance = 0.843). This statistical clustering confirms a reversion to the conventional, high-health rhetorical style.
*   **The Trump administration's rhetoric was uniquely volatile.** Levene's test for homogeneity of variances was highly significant (p < .001), driven by the Trump administration's large variance in CHI scores (SD = 0.56). This indicates a mixture of extreme constitutional pathology, as in the 2025 Inaugural Address, with moments of more conventional constitutional respect, as seen in the 2018 State of the Union address.
*   **Institutional subversion was the primary driver of negative constitutional health.** The Trump administration was the only presidency to score a negative mean Institutional Health Index (-0.10). This was fueled by consistent, salient attacks on the legitimacy of the governing establishment, as when President Trump declared, "For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2025.txt).

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Framework Description

This analysis employs the **Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v10.0**, a computational social science tool designed to systematically evaluate the impact of political discourse on the health of a constitutional system. Grounded in the theoretical work of Walter Bagehot, Francis Fukuyama, and Jonathan Rauch, the framework posits that constitutional health is a "living" quality reflected in rhetoric, not merely in legal documents.

The CHF evaluates discourse across three bipolar axes:
1.  **Procedural Axis**: Measures the balance between *Procedural Legitimacy* (support for established processes) and *Procedural Rejection* (advocacy for circumventing norms).
2.  **Institutional Axis**: Measures the balance between *Institutional Respect* (recognition of institutional authority) and *Institutional Subversion* (delegitimizing attacks on institutions).
3.  **Systemic Axis**: Measures the balance between *Systemic Continuity* (support for gradual reform) and *Systemic Replacement* (advocacy for revolutionary change).

A key innovation of the CHF is its use of **salience weighting**. Each dimension is scored for both its intensity (`raw_score`) and its rhetorical prominence (`salience`). This allows for the calculation of derived metrics, including the primary **Constitutional Health Index (CHI)**, that reflect not only what was said but which themes were most emphasized by the speaker.

### 4.2 Corpus Description

The study analyzed the **Presidential Addresses to Congress Corpus (v10.0)**, a collection of 48 speeches delivered between 1992 and 2025. The corpus includes State of the Union (SOTU) addresses, inaugural addresses, and other joint session speeches, providing a consistent and comparable format for analyzing formal presidential rhetoric. The documents are grouped by administration: Bush H.W. (n=1), Clinton (n=12), Bush W. (n=11), Obama (n=12), Trump (n=7), and Biden (n=6). The single address from the Bush H.W. administration serves as a historical baseline but is excluded from inferential statistical tests due to its sample size.

### 4.3 Statistical Methods

The analysis employed a multi-tiered statistical approach.
*   **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) were calculated for all dimensional and derived metrics, grouped by administration.
*   **Inferential Testing**: A one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test for significant differences in the `constitutional_health_index` across the five multi-document administrations. A significance level of α = 0.05 was used.
*   **Post-Hoc Analysis**: A Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test was conducted to identify which specific administration pairs differed significantly.
*   **Variance Analysis**: Levene's test for homogeneity of variances was used to assess differences in the variability of CHI scores across administrations.
*   **Effect Size**: Eta-squared (η²) was calculated for the ANOVA to determine the proportion of variance in CHI attributable to the presidential administration.
*   **Rhetorical Profile Similarity**: Euclidean distances between the mean 6-dimensional raw score vectors of each administration were calculated to quantify rhetorical similarity. Hierarchical clustering (Ward's method) was used to visualize these relationships.
*   **Framework Validation**: Cronbach's alpha (α) was calculated to assess the internal consistency of the framework's "health" (Procedural Legitimacy, Institutional Respect, Systemic Continuity) and "pathology" (Procedural Rejection, Institutional Subversion, Systemic Replacement) subscales.

## 5. Comprehensive Results

### 5.1 Hypothesis Evaluation

The experiment was designed to test seven hypotheses regarding the constitutional health of presidential rhetoric.

**H₁: At least one administration differs significantly from the others in constitutional health scores.**
**CONFIRMED.** The one-way ANOVA yielded a statistically significant result (F(4, 39) = 13.84, p < .001), indicating that the mean `constitutional_health_index` is not equal across all five administrations. The presidential administration accounts for a large portion of the variance in constitutional health scores (η² = 0.59).

**H₂: μ_trump ≠ μ_bush_w (Trump differs significantly from Republican peer Bush W.).**
**CONFIRMED.** The post-hoc Tukey HSD test revealed a significant difference between the Trump and Bush W. administrations (mean difference = -0.72, p < .001). The Trump administration's mean CHI (M = -0.005) was substantially lower than that of the Bush W. administration (M = 0.72).

**H₃: μ_trump ≠ μ_clinton, μ_obama (Trump differs significantly from Democratic administrations).**
**CONFIRMED.** The Tukey HSD test confirmed that the Trump administration's mean CHI was significantly lower than both the Clinton administration (mean difference = -0.85, p < .001) and the Obama administration (mean difference = -0.76, p < .001).

**H₄: μ_biden ≠ μ_clinton, μ_obama (Biden differs significantly from Democratic peers Clinton and Obama).**
**FALSIFIED.** The Tukey HSD test found no significant differences between the Biden administration and its Democratic predecessors. The mean difference between Biden and Clinton was not significant (p = 0.64), nor was the difference between Biden and Obama (p = 0.95).

**H₅: |μ_biden - μ_trump| > |μ_clinton - μ_bush_w|, |μ_obama - μ_bush_w| (Biden-Trump difference exceeds other cross-party differences).**
**CONFIRMED.** The absolute mean difference in CHI between the Biden and Trump administrations (0.67) is substantially larger than the differences between Clinton and Bush W. (0.12) and Obama and Bush W. (0.04). This highlights an exceptional degree of rhetorical divergence between the two most recent administrations compared to previous partisan transitions.

**H₆: Trump shows significantly higher variance in constitutional health scores than other administrations.**
**CONFIRMED.** Levene's test for homogeneity of variances was significant (p < .001), rejecting the null hypothesis of equal variances. Examination of the descriptive statistics confirms this is driven by the Trump administration, which had a standard deviation (SD = 0.56) more than 2.5 times larger than any other administration except Bush W. (SD = 0.21). This indicates a uniquely volatile rhetorical style, mixing high-pathology rhetoric with moments of conventional discourse.

**H₇: Biden's constitutional health profile is more similar to Trump than to Clinton/Obama.**
**FALSIFIED.** Euclidean distance analysis, which measures similarity in the 6-dimensional rhetorical space, shows the Biden administration's profile is far closer to Obama (distance = 0.187) and Clinton (distance = 0.286) than to Trump (distance = 0.843). Hierarchical clustering further confirms that the Biden, Obama, Clinton, and Bush W. administrations form a cohesive group, with the Trump administration as a distant outlier.

### 5.2 Descriptive Statistics: A Tale of Two Norms

Analysis of the mean scores for the `constitutional_health_index` (CHI) and `constitutional_pathology_index` (CPI) reveals a stark divide in modern presidential rhetoric.

**Table 1: Mean Constitutional Health and Pathology Indices by Administration**

| Administration | N  | Mean CHI (SD) | Mean CPI (SD) |
| :--------------- | :- | :-------------- | :-------------- |
| Bush H.W.      | 1  | 0.87 (---)      | 0.00 (---)      |
| Clinton          | 12 | 0.84 (0.08)     | 0.01 (0.01)     |
| Bush W.          | 11 | 0.72 (0.21)     | 0.05 (0.08)     |
| Obama            | 12 | 0.76 (0.08)     | 0.02 (0.02)     |
| **Trump**        | 7  | **-0.005 (0.56)*** | **0.36 (0.30)***  |
| Biden            | 6  | 0.66 (0.16)     | 0.07 (0.07)     |

*Note: CHI and CPI range from -1 to +1 and 0 to 1, respectively. SD = Standard Deviation. ***p < .001 on Tukey HSD pairwise comparisons against all other administrations.*

A clear pattern emerges: from Bush H.W. to Obama, and again under Biden, presidential addresses maintain a high average CHI (M > 0.65) and a very low average CPI (M < 0.07). This suggests a stable, bipartisan rhetorical norm. The Trump administration is the sole, dramatic exception, with a mean CHI near zero and a mean CPI an order of magnitude greater than its peers. This is not merely a matter of degree but a fundamental shift in rhetorical content. While other presidents engaged in constructive criticism of institutions, President Trump's rhetoric was characterized by direct, salient attacks on their legitimacy. For example, in his 2017 Inaugural Address, he stated: "For too long, a small group in our Nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of Government while the people have borne the cost... The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2017.txt). This contrasts sharply with the rhetoric of his predecessors, such as President Clinton, who framed challenges as opportunities for renewal within the existing system: "And tonight, let us resolve to continue the journey of renewal, to create more and better jobs... to renew our own American community" (Source: Clinton_SOTU_1999.txt).

### 5.3 Advanced Metric Analysis: The Anatomy of Pathology

The framework's axis-level health indices reveal the specific drivers of the overall trend. The Trump administration is the only presidency to register negative mean scores on both the `procedural_health_index` (M = -0.04) and the `institutional_health_index` (M = -0.10). This indicates that, on average, the salience-weighted rhetoric of rejection and subversion in his speeches outweighed that of legitimacy and respect.

This pattern is exemplified by rhetoric that simultaneously delegitimizes processes and institutions. In his 2020 State of the Union, President Trump claimed, "An economic miracle is taking place in the United States, and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous, partisan investigations" (Source: Trump_SOTU_2020.txt). This statement frames a legitimate constitutional process (investigations) as an illegitimate political attack, thereby scoring high on both `procedural_rejection` and `institutional_subversion`.

In contrast, the Biden administration's rhetoric explicitly counters this trend, focusing on restoration. As President Biden stated in his 2021 Inaugural Address, "The people’s—the will of the people has been heard, and the will of the people has been heeded... We’ve learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed" (Source: Biden_Inaugural_2021.txt). This direct reaffirmation of procedural legitimacy and democratic systems contributes to the administration's high CHI score and its clustering with pre-Trump presidencies.

### 5.4 Correlation and Interaction Analysis

The high internal consistency of the framework's subscales (Health α = 0.946; Pathology α = 0.886) provides strong evidence for two distinct, cohesive rhetorical styles.
1.  **Constitutional Health Style**: A mutually reinforcing pattern of supporting established procedures, respecting institutional roles, and advocating for gradual, continuous improvement of the system. This style was the norm for all administrations except Trump's.
2.  **Constitutional Pathology Style**: A similarly cohesive pattern of rejecting procedures, subverting institutions, and calling for systemic replacement. This style was uniquely prominent in the Trump administration.

The data shows that these are not simply opposites but represent coherent communication strategies. For instance, the rhetoric of systemic replacement is often used to justify institutional subversion. In his 2025 Inaugural Address, President Trump frames a "revolution" as the necessary response to a "radical and corrupt establishment," stating, "Today, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense" (Source: Trump_Inaugural_2025.txt). This linkage of pathology dimensions creates a powerful, internally consistent anti-constitutional narrative.

### 5.5 Pattern Recognition and Theoretical Insights

The most telling pattern is the statistical isolation of the Trump administration. Euclidean distance analysis in the 6-dimensional raw score space quantifies this divergence. The rhetorical distance between the Trump and Obama administrations is 0.92, whereas the distance between the Obama and Bush W. administrations is only 0.12. This demonstrates that the partisan shift from Bush W. to Obama involved a minor change in constitutional rhetoric compared to the seismic shift that occurred with the Trump presidency.

This finding aligns with theories of democratic erosion, which posit that the breakdown of democratic norms often precedes formal institutional collapse. The data suggests that the Trump administration's rhetoric represented a significant erosion of the informal, rhetorical norms that support the constitutional system. While presidents like Bush W. used crisis to justify procedural flexibility, as when he declared "I will not wait on events while dangers gather" (Source: Bush_SOTU_2007.txt), this was typically embedded within a broader message of institutional respect. The Trump administration's rhetoric, however, frequently centered the delegitimization of the system itself as the core message.

## 6. Discussion

The results of this analysis carry significant implications for the study of presidential rhetoric and democratic health. The primary finding—that the Trump administration's constitutional rhetoric is a statistical outlier fundamentally dissimilar to that of his modern predecessors and successor—provides empirical weight to a widely observed but previously unquantified phenomenon. The data suggests a departure from a long-standing, bipartisan rhetorical convention of upholding constitutional norms in formal addresses to Congress.

Theoretically, these findings support the "living constitution" perspective of Bagehot, demonstrating that the health of a constitutional system is reflected and shaped by the discourse of its leaders. The high internal consistency of the "pathology" subscale (α = 0.886) suggests that attacks on procedures, institutions, and the system itself are not random but form a cohesive rhetorical strategy aligned with models of democratic erosion. The rhetoric of a "broken system" (`procedural_rejection`) is used to legitimize attacks on the "failed establishment" (`institutional_subversion`), which in turn necessitates "radical transformation" (`systemic_replacement`).

The return of the Biden administration's rhetoric to the pre-Trump statistical cluster is equally significant. It suggests that the Trump-era rhetorical style may have been an aberration tied to a specific political movement, rather than a permanent realignment of presidential discourse. However, the slightly lower mean CHI and higher mean CPI for the Biden administration compared to the Clinton/Obama era may indicate a lingering effect or a new normal where a low level of pathological rhetoric is a feature of post-Trump politics.

### 6.1 Limitations and Future Directions

This study's primary limitation is the small sample size for some administrations, particularly Trump (n=7) and Biden (n=6). While the ANOVA was well-powered overall, and the differences involving the Trump administration were large enough to be detected with high confidence, conclusions about the Biden administration should be considered preliminary. Future research should expand the corpus to include a wider range of speeches and documents to increase statistical power.

Furthermore, this analysis did not find a significant effect for speech type (SOTU vs. Inaugural vs. Joint Session), but this may be due to unbalanced group sizes. A more targeted study design could better isolate the contextual effects of these different rhetorical settings. Finally, this study quantifies the "what" of rhetorical change; future research could explore the "why" by correlating these constitutional health scores with polling data, media coverage, and policy outcomes to understand the causes and consequences of these rhetorical shifts.

## 7. Conclusion

This computational analysis of 48 presidential addresses provides robust, quantitative evidence of a significant disruption and subsequent reversion in the constitutional health of American presidential rhetoric. For over two decades, a stable, bipartisan norm of high constitutional health prevailed. The Trump administration marked a statistically significant break from this norm, employing a cohesive and volatile rhetorical style high in constitutional pathology. The Biden administration, in turn, has rhetorically realigned with the pre-Trump convention.

The Constitutional Health Framework (CHF) v10.0 proved to be a valid and reliable instrument for this analysis, effectively discriminating between rhetorical styles and demonstrating high internal consistency in its core constructs. The findings validate the framework's theoretical underpinnings—that the health of a constitutional democracy is tied to the discourse that supports it—and provide a powerful, data-driven tool for scholars, journalists, and citizens to monitor the "living" health of their political systems. This research underscores the critical importance of leadership rhetoric in either reinforcing or eroding the foundations of democratic governance.
