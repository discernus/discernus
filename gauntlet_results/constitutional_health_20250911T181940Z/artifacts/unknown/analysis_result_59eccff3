This usually means the one with the highest confidence or the most representative one from the three analyses. If multiple have high confidence, I'll pick the most concise/powerful one.\n7.  **Format Output:** Construct the final JSON output according to the specified schema, including the delimiters.\n\n**Framework Details (after decoding):**\n\n*   **Framework Name:** \"constitutional_health_framework\"\n*   **Framework Version:** \"1.0.0\"\n*   **Dimensions:**\n    *   `procedural_legitimacy`: Support for established procedures, constitutional processes, democratic norms.\n    *   `procedural_rejection`: Rejecting established procedures, extra-constitutional action, process bypassing.\n    *   `institutional_respect`: Recognition of institutional authority, expertise, checks and balances.\n    *   `institutional_subversion`: Attacking institutional authority, delegitimizing institutions.\n    *   `systemic_continuity`: Support for maintaining/improving existing framework, gradual reform.\n    *   `systemic_replacement`: Advocating fundamental replacement, revolutionary change.\n\n**Scoring Guidelines:**\n*   Scores 0.0-1.0 for `intensity`, `salience`, and `confidence`.\n*   `raw_score` (intensity): How much of the dimension is present.\n*   `salience`: Rhetorical prominence (frequency, structural position, thematic centrality, rhetorical devices).

Bush's State of the Union address from January 28, 2003. I expect strong themes of national unity, defense, and potentially some calls for action that might touch on constitutional processes or institutional roles.\n\n**Pre-computation for all approaches (all dimensions start at 0.0, will be updated by each approach):**\n\n*   `procedural_legitimacy`: Support for established procedures, constitutional processes, adherence to democratic norms.\n*   `procedural_rejection`: Rejecting established procedures, extra-constitutional action, process bypassing.\n*   `institutional_respect`: Recognition of institutional authority, expertise, and legitimate governance role, support for checks and balances.\n*   `institutional_subversion`: Attacking institutional authority, expertise, or legitimacy.\n*   `systemic_continuity`: Support for maintaining and improving existing constitutional framework, gradual reform.\n*   `systemic_replacement`: Advocating fundamental replacement of constitutional framework, revolutionary change.\n\nNow, I will run the three independent analyses.\n\n---\n**APPROACH 1 - Evidence-First Analysis**\n\nFocus: Direct textual evidence, explicit statements.\n\n**Document: Bush_SOTU_2003.txt**\n\n*   **procedural_legitimacy**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.8\n    * `salience`: 0.7\n    * `confidence`: 0.9\n    * `evidence`: The speech frequently references working with Congress, adhering to laws, and supporting democratic processes abroad. E.g., \"But even though debates can be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger. To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of good will and respect for one another, and I will do my part.\" and \"Elections are vital, but they are only the beginning. Raising up a democracy requires the rule of law and protection of minorities and strong, accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote.\" Also, \"I urge Members of Congress to serve the interests of America by showing the compassion of America.\"\n*   **procedural_rejection**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.0\n    * `salience`: 0.0\n    * `confidence`: 0.9\n    * `evidence`: No explicit statements rejecting established procedures or advocating for extra-constitutional action. The language consistently emphasizes working within established governmental structures.\n*   **institutional_respect**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.9\n    * `salience`: 0.8\n    * `confidence`: 0.95\n    * `evidence`: Strong and frequent recognition of Congress's role, Supreme Court, military, and other institutions. \"Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, members of the Supreme Court and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:\" - opening address. \"In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there will always be differences and debate. But even though debates can be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger. To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of good will and respect for one another, and I will do my part.\" \"Our coalition has learned from our experience in Iraq. We\u2019ve adjusted our military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction. Along the way, we have benefited from responsible criticism and counsel offered by Members of Congress of both parties. In the coming year, I will continue to reach out and seek your good advice.\" \"A hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under the law. The Supreme Court now has two superb new members on its bench, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sam Alito. I thank the Senate for confirming both of them. I will continue to nominate men and women who understand that judges must be servants of the law and not legislate from the bench.\"\n*   **institutional_subversion**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.0\n    * `salience`: 0.0\n    * `confidence`: 0.9\n    * `evidence`: No language delegitimizing or attacking existing democratic institutions. The criticism of \"activist courts\" is framed as a call for adherence to established roles, not subversion. \"activist courts that try to redefine marriage\" is framed as a critique of judicial overreach, not an attack on the institution itself, but rather on specific *actions* that are seen as outside their proper role, therefore a call for *respect* for the institutional boundaries. This leans towards positive institutional respect (for proper roles) rather than subversion. I'll score this 0.0 as it's not a general attack on institutions.\n*   **systemic_continuity**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.9\n    * `salience`: 0.8\n    * `confidence`: 0.95\n    * `evidence`: The entire speech is premised on maintaining and strengthening the existing American system while adapting to new challenges. Calls for \"gradual reform\" are explicit in areas like the economy and healthcare. \"Tonight the state of our Union is strong, and together we will make it stronger.\" \"The only way to protect our people, the only way to secure the peace, the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership. So the United States of America will continue to lead.\" \"America rejects the false comfort of isolationism. We are the nation that saved liberty in Europe and liberated death camps and helped raise up democracies and faced down an evil empire. Once again, we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed and move this world toward peace.\" \"Our economy is healthy and vigorous and growing faster than other major industrialized nations.\" Calls for tax cuts and reforms within the existing economic system, not a radical overhaul.\n*   **systemic_replacement**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.0\n    * `salience`: 0.0\n    * `confidence`: 0.9\n    * `evidence`: There is no rhetoric advocating for a fundamental replacement of the constitutional framework or revolutionary change within the U.S. political system. Calls for change are within the existing system.\n\n---\n**APPROACH 2 - Context-Weighted Analysis**\n\nFocus: Rhetorical context, structural positioning, thematic centrality.\n\n**Document: Bush_SOTU_2003.txt**\n\n*   **procedural_legitimacy**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.8\n    * `salience`: 0.9\n    * `confidence`: 0.9\n    * `evidence`: The entire speech, being a State of the Union address, is a formal constitutional process. The President's direct address to Congress and the nation emphasizes working within established channels. The repeated emphasis on \"good will and respect for one another\" within the \"system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches\" at the outset sets a strong tone of procedural legitimacy. The call for bipartisan solutions for Social Security (\"put aside partisan politics and work together\") reinforces this.\n*   **procedural_rejection**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.0\n    * `salience`: 0.0\n    * `confidence`: 0.9\n    * `evidence`: The formal setting and consistent adherence to the constitutional role of the President in addressing Congress signify a complete absence of procedural rejection.\n*   **institutional_respect**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.9\n    * `salience`: 0.95\n    * `confidence`: 0.95\n    * `evidence`: The speech opens by addressing various institutional leaders (\"Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, members of the Supreme Court and diplomatic corps\"). This formal recognition is a highly salient indicator. Throughout the speech, there are numerous mentions of the military, intelligence community, law enforcement, Congress, the Supreme Court, and their roles, consistently framing them as vital and legitimate. The explicit gratitude towards the Senate for judicial confirmations and the articulation of the proper role of judges further highlights this. The mention of \"responsible criticism and counsel offered by Members of Congress of both parties\" also shows respect for their institutional role.\n*   **institutional_subversion**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.0\n    * `salience`: 0.0\n    * `confidence`: 0.9\n    * `evidence`: The speech lacks any direct or implied attacks on the legitimacy of American institutions. While there is a mention of \"activist courts,\" this is framed as an appeal for adherence to judicial role, rather than an undermining of the institution itself.\n*   **systemic_continuity**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.9\n    * `salience`: 0.9\n    * `confidence`: 0.95\n    * `evidence`: The core message is about strengthening America within its existing democratic and economic framework. Phrases like \"state of our Union is strong, and together we will make it stronger,\" \"continue to lead,\" \"maintain and improving existing constitutional framework\" and the consistent focus on \"reform\" within the current system (e.g., tax relief, budget cuts, healthcare, energy independence, education) all point to systemic continuity. The historical references to past Presidents rejecting isolationism also serve to frame current actions as part of a continuous American tradition. \"Our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy, a war that will be fought by Presidents of both parties who will need steady bipartisan support from the Congress.\"\n*   **systemic_replacement**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.0\n    * `salience`: 0.0\n    * `confidence`: 0.9\n    * `evidence`: There are no structural arguments or thematic elements suggesting a need for a complete overhaul of the American system. The focus is entirely on preserving and enhancing what exists.\n\n---\n**APPROACH 3 - Pattern-Based Analysis**\n\nFocus: Repetition patterns, rhetorical devices, strategic emphasis.\n\n**Document: Bush_SOTU_2003.txt**\n\n*   **procedural_legitimacy**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.7\n    * `salience`: 0.7\n    * `confidence`: 0.8\n    * `evidence`: Repetition of phrases like \"together,\" \"Congress,\" and \"bipartisan\" throughout the domestic policy section (\"put aside partisan politics and work together,\" \"I urge Congress to act responsibly and make the tax cuts permanent\"). The frequent appeals to Congress for legislation (\"I ask the Congress to pass medical liability reform this year\") reinforce working through proper legislative channels.\n*   **procedural_rejection**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.0\n    * `salience`: 0.0\n    * `confidence`: 0.9\n    * `evidence`: Absence of rhetoric that dismisses or bypasses established procedures. The language is formal and adheres to governmental norms.\n*   **institutional_respect**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.8\n    * `salience`: 0.8\n    * `confidence`: 0.9\n    * `evidence`: The repeated naming of various governmental bodies and officials (e.g., \"Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, members of the Supreme Court,\" \"our military,\" \"law enforcement, intelligence, the military, and homeland security\") establishes a pattern of recognizing their authority and contribution. The quote from Staff Sergeant Dan Clay (\"I know what honor is\u2026 it has been an honor to protect and serve all of you\") exemplifies respect for institutional service. The repeated references to \"our Nation\" and \"our country\" implicitly refer to the institutions that govern them.\n*   **institutional_subversion**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.0\n    * `salience`: 0.0\n    * `confidence`: 0.9\n    * `evidence`: No patterns of rhetorical devices or recurring phrases aimed at undermining trust or legitimacy in core institutions.\n*   **systemic_continuity**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.8\n    * `salience`: 0.85\n    * `confidence`: 0.9\n    * `evidence`: The dominant rhetorical pattern is one of incremental progress and reinforcement. Phrases like \"state of our Union is strong,\" \"make it stronger,\" \"continue to lead,\" \"move forward\" (repeated), \"gradual reform\" (concept, not exact phrase), and \"we will continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity.\" The use of historical parallels (Lincoln, MLK, past presidents rejecting isolationism) serves to ground the current challenges and proposed solutions within a continuous American narrative, emphasizing evolution rather than revolution.\n*   **systemic_replacement**:\n    * `raw_score`: 0.0\n    * `salience`: 0.0\n    * `confidence`: 0.9\n    * `evidence`: No rhetoric signaling a fundamental break from the existing system. The speech consistently advocates for strengthening the current system.\n\n---\n**Aggregation and Final Output**\n\nNow I will aggregate the scores for each dimension (median of raw_score, median of salience, median of confidence) and select the best evidence.\n\n*   **procedural_legitimacy**:\n    *   Raw scores: [0.8, 0.8, 0.7] -> Median: 0.8\n    *   Salience scores: [0.7, 0.9, 0.7] -> Median: 0.7\n    *   Confidence scores: [0.9, 0.9, 0.8] -> Median: 0.9\n    *   Best evidence: \"Elections are vital, but they are only the beginning.
