# Root Cause Analysis & Fix

## 5 Whys Analysis Results

**Problem**: Statistical integration failing due to missing dimensions

**Why 1**: Why are dimensions missing from statistical analysis?
- Because LLM generates incomplete dimension sets (missing `enmity`, `amity`, `compersion`)

**Why 2**: Why does the LLM generate incomplete dimensions?
- Because CFF v7.3's `analysis_prompt` uses inconsistent dimension names

**Why 3**: Why are dimension names inconsistent?
- Because the framework specification doesn't enforce consistency between `dimension_groups` and `analysis_prompt`

**Why 4**: Why doesn't the specification prevent this?
- Because v7.3 spec lacks explicit validation requirements

**Why 5**: Why is validation missing?
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Framework specification is architecturally incomplete - allows critical inconsistencies

## Fixes Required

### 1. Fix CFF v7.3 Framework (Immediate)
- Change "fragmentative goals" → "fragmentative_goals" 
- Change "cohesive goals" → "cohesive_goals"
- Ensures exact match with dimension_groups specification

### 2. Fix Framework Specification v7.3 (Architectural)
- Add explicit consistency requirement between `analysis_prompt` and `dimension_groups`
- Require that all dimensions in dimension_groups appear in analysis_prompt steps

### 3. Validation System (Future)
- Framework validation should check analysis_prompt/dimension_groups consistency
- Prevent publication of inconsistent frameworks

## Impact
This architectural fix ensures:
- Complete dimension generation from analysis agents
- Consistent statistical processing pipeline  
- Reliable synthesis with all required data
- Framework-agnostic robustness

## Testing
After fixes:
1. All 10 CFF dimensions should be generated
2. Statistical pipeline should receive complete data
3. Synthesis should show quantitative evidence backing
4. No more missing/NaN statistical values
