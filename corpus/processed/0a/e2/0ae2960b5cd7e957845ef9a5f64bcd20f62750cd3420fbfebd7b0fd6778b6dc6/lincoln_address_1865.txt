Abraham Lincoln
Second Inaugural Address
March 4, 1865

Fellow countrymen: At this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first.

At this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first. On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, urgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without warâ€”seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish. And the war came.
