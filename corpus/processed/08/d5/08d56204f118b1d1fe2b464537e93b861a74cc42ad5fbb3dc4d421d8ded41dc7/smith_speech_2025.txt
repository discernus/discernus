President Jane Smith
State of the Union Address
January 29, 2025

Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:

I come before you tonight to report on the state of our Union—and to share my vision for the year ahead. The state of our Union is resilient, innovative, and ready to face whatever challenges come our way.

This past year has tested us in ways we never imagined. We faced economic uncertainty, global supply chain disruptions, and the ongoing challenges of a changing climate. But through it all, the American people have shown what we do best: we adapt, we innovate, and we come together.

Tonight, I want to talk about three key priorities for our nation: strengthening our economy for the 21st century, rebuilding our infrastructure for the future, and ensuring that America remains the land of opportunity for all.

First, our economy. When I took office, unemployment was at its highest level in decades. Today, thanks to the resilience of American workers and businesses, we've created over 10 million new jobs. Our unemployment rate has dropped to levels not seen since before the pandemic.

But we cannot rest on our laurels. The economy of tomorrow will be built on clean energy, advanced manufacturing, and cutting-edge technology. That's why I'm proposing the American Innovation Initiative—a comprehensive plan to invest $500 billion over the next five years in research and development, clean energy infrastructure, and workforce training programs.

This initiative will create millions of good-paying jobs in growing industries. Solar panel installers, wind turbine technicians, electric vehicle manufacturers, and data center specialists—these are the jobs of the future, and we want them to be American jobs.

We're already seeing the results of our investments. In Michigan, a new electric vehicle battery plant is employing 3,000 workers. In Texas, a semiconductor facility is bringing high-tech manufacturing back to American soil. In California, breakthrough research in artificial intelligence is positioning us to lead the world in the technologies of tomorrow.

Second, infrastructure. For too long, we've allowed our roads, bridges, airports, and broadband networks to fall behind those of other developed nations. The Infrastructure Investment Act that we passed last year is already putting Americans to work rebuilding our foundation for the future.

We're not just fixing what's broken—we're building what's next. High-speed rail connections between major cities. A nationwide network of electric vehicle charging stations. Upgraded ports and airports that can handle the cargo ships and passenger planes of the 21st century.

In Pennsylvania, workers are rebuilding a bridge that connects two halves of a community that have been separated for decades. In Arizona, we're laying fiber optic cables to bring high-speed internet to rural communities that have been left behind by the digital revolution. In Louisiana, we're strengthening levees and flood barriers to protect communities from increasingly severe weather events.

This infrastructure investment isn't just about concrete and steel—it's about connecting people to opportunities. When a student in rural America can access the same online educational resources as a student in New York City, we're building a more equitable future. When a small business owner can ship products quickly and efficiently to customers anywhere in the world, we're strengthening our competitive edge.

Third, opportunity. America has always been the land where anyone, regardless of their background, can build a better life through hard work and determination. But for too many families, that promise feels out of reach.

The cost of housing has skyrocketed in many communities. Young people are graduating from college with crushing debt. Working families are struggling to afford childcare while building their careers. We must address these challenges head-on.

My administration is working with Congress on comprehensive housing reform that will increase the supply of affordable homes and apartments while making homeownership more accessible to first-time buyers. We're expanding access to community college and trade school programs that prepare workers for in-demand careers without requiring a four-year degree.

We're also supporting families by expanding the Child Tax Credit and making childcare more affordable. When parents don't have to choose between working and caring for their children, our entire economy benefits.

Education remains one of our greatest priorities. We're investing in our teachers, upgrading our schools, and ensuring that every student has access to the technology and resources they need to succeed. From early childhood education through graduate school, we're building an education system worthy of the 21st century.

But our work extends beyond our borders. America's leadership on the global stage has never been more important. We're strengthening our alliances, standing up for democratic values, and addressing global challenges that require international cooperation.

Climate change doesn't recognize national borders. Neither do pandemics, cyber threats, or economic instability. By working with our allies and partners around the world, we can tackle these challenges more effectively than any nation could alone.

We're also ensuring that America remains the destination of choice for the world's brightest minds and most ambitious entrepreneurs. Our immigration system should reflect our values while meeting our economic needs. We must continue to be a nation that welcomes those who come here seeking freedom, opportunity, and the chance to contribute to our shared prosperity.

As we look to the year ahead, I'm optimistic about what we can accomplish together. The challenges we face are real, but so is our capacity to overcome them. We're already seeing signs of the transformation taking place across our country.

In Ohio, a young woman who lost her manufacturing job is now training to become a solar panel installer. In Georgia, a veteran is using his GI Bill benefits to study cybersecurity at a community college. In Washington state, a family is moving into their first home, purchased with help from our first-time homebuyer program.

These are the stories that give me hope. These are the reasons why I remain confident in America's future. We are a nation of builders, dreamers, and problem-solvers. We've overcome greater challenges before, and we'll overcome the challenges ahead.

But our success depends on our ability to work together. Progress requires both ambition and pragmatism. It requires us to be willing to try new approaches while learning from our mistakes. Most importantly, it requires us to remember that we share common ground as Americans, even when we disagree on the path forward.

I call on Congress to work with my administration on these critical priorities. I call on business leaders to invest in American workers and communities. I call on educators to prepare students for the jobs of tomorrow. And I call on every American to do their part in building the future we want to see.

The state of our Union is strong because the American people are strong. We've faced uncertainty before, and we've emerged stronger each time. This year will be no different.

Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
