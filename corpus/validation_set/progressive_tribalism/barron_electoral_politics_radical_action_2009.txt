Thank you very much it's indeed and honored to be here give me another handclap that was too weak just a little more prank afternoon after lunch see the morning speakers got it made after lunch y'all get a little a little weak with the camps claps uh i wanted to also introduce who's with me today who we call the intellectual engine of our movement one who really knows this stuff makes us look smarter than what we really are and that's mr paul washington who's been a long time activist.

Wanted to come and talk about several things you know one of the things that we get probably overwhelmingly involved in in our day-to-day lives and day-to-day struggles in new york city is the symptoms symptomology organizing the symptoms of a deeply rooted structural failure in america called capitalism you get involved in a lot of the symptoms of that whether it's police brutality housing unemployment healthcare so we do a lot of symptom organizing and oftentimes when it comes to getting people to understand the real structural flaws in this system and what really needs to happen of course nobody talks about revolution anymore that's a bad word uh socialism is another bad word but we need to look at how do we develop movements that will deal with the structural flaws the deeper rooted illnesses in this country that capitalism produces.

Secondly some of the tactical organizing around that i want to challenge us those who are revolutionaries or radicals or socialists or who whatever you like to call yourself whatever whoever whatever you are we need to get more involved in getting power to do something other than demonstrations and conferences and those things that we say power at and cooperative you know and all of that we need to really look at how we can access power how do you cease power maintain it what is power and what's the difference between power and influence and then we need to definitely put up front and center i know we have issues around race class is it race is it class does race come first does class come first we need to deal with both and definitely we should not minimize race and not see the impact of race in this country gender sexism classism racism the triple evils of capitalism these are things that i think that we have to really focus on.

But i wanted to challenge us today to look at electoral politics as a tactic not a panacea not an end all not this is the and only way that we're going to change this system but as a way to effect change as a way to deal with the question of power and the question of resources how do we get resources to deal with the issues in our communities i started off talking about symptomology but that's real in our community the african-american community and probably many communities there's always a a balance a challenge a dual struggle struggle for survival and a struggle for liberation and for change and for radical change.

The struggles for survival is where most of our people are i want to know if you're going to get them a job want to know if they can get an affordable house want to know if you can get the police to back up a little bit keep them off their backs of profiling and brutalizing and killing us so the survival struggle often takes precedence over the struggle for liberation the struggle for revolution the struggle for social change if you will and if revolution's too strong struggle for transformation for change it's difficult getting people who are barely eating paying them rent or not in shelter that they feel is affordable and reasonable to get them involved in the struggle for liberation the struggle for transformation the struggle for revolution and change.

So it is our challenge as we move as we are in the 21st century how do we come up with those strategies and tactics that go beyond us preaching to the choir preaching to each other having rallies and conferences that we we come to and y'all probably know everything i'm about to say and have said it before yourself and we'll go on and say it at another conference write another book read another book how do we engage ourselves in something that goes beyond that to affect change.

So when you look at it on a macro level and you see globalization running amok and you see two wars barack obama transferring one war from iraq to afghanistan and bombing pakistan when you see that we still have to deal with a system that still hasn't returned the people to new orleans particularly black people in the lower ninth ward have yet to go back to their homes yet when barack obama was there he took care of the contractors whose contracts were being held up and now those contracts are moving so they'll make some money but the people from new orleans are not back in their homes.

So when we look at those grand issues when we look at the issues of health care are they no longer talking about single-payer medicare for all system but some kind of public option that won't be a real option even if they get the public option and they probably won't even get that so what comes out of there is probably going to be some pseudo reform where the insurance companies will continue to make billions of dollars off of us being ill and where the masses of american people still won't be able to afford any quality health care this is what we must impact this is what we must begin to organize around and have impact and that's why i say electoral politics is a way a tactic that can be used.

When i got elected to the city council people tell you all kinds of things that you have to change to get elected you have to change once you're in office in order to extract things from the system but i looked at several people around in our community when we're looking at who we are as an african people in this country and who they're projecting as us being african people in this country who are the leadership now and looking at those issues of leadership in our community and when we look at the leaders that are engaged in electoral politics and how they get there and what they do after they get there it is a clarion cry that i make and call for radicals revolutionaries to get involved in electoral politics particularly on a local level.

You know running some people say i'm not going to be involved in the ruling class parties those republicans and democrats i'm not getting involved in the system we have to have an inside out strategy you go ahead inside i'll be outside ain't no outside all of you are inside all of you are paying taxes to capitalism well i think she wouldn't be sitting here all of us are inside this monster all of us are inside this belly of this beast but for us to try to maintain intellectual and philosophical and ideological purity we claim we don't want to get involved in electoral politics because uh i can't do that but i don't know where your bank account is i don't know what company you work for i don't know what system you're working in whether it's education system where your employment is but you can rest assure we are walking contradictions each and every one of us are dealing with capitalism on one level or another so why not electoral politics why not getting some of us involved to get up in there and and maintain and present a radical edge in electoral politics.

When i was running they said charles if you want to get elected you better not go out there talking all of that black stuff if you want to get elected you better put yourself on a shirt and tie take off that old 1960s suit and you better change your conversation if you want to get elected i said well i'm not going to do that and i'm going to get elected and then when i was talking to some of my colleagues after i did get elected and they said well charles if you want to get anything you better tone down that black radical stuff of the 60s because you're not going to get anything for your neighborhood they will punish you they will isolate you and you will not be able to get anything for your neighborhood i said well not only am i not gonna tone it down i'm gonna tone it up i'm gonna say even more stuff and i did just that spoke my mind.

I don't salute the flag i think if it miller purposely had us pledge an allegiance they didn't do that until i came in that was one of his ways of uh he said he calls me in his office charles is not directed at you but we're gonna now start pledging allegiance in the city council i said give it y'all go right ahead enjoy your pledge because i will not be standing up for that and they say why not charles i want to know because my mama told me not to lie not to pledge to lies my mama told me to tell the truth so i can't pledge to a lie so i sit down all the time he was hoping that the cameras would come on me sitting down everybody's pledging then they sat me next to thomas jefferson because i called him a slaveholding pedophile so they moved my seat next to him you know in the statue the statue that's in city hall.

You know there's a lot of little things they do there's no you all don't know what i go through i have to sit next to thomas jefferson every meeting everything in city hall is political where you see you sit which office you're to have and the reason why a lot of council members are spineless and the reason why a lot of the state assembly people are spineless because there's no democracy it's the dictatorship of the speaker the speaker determines how much capital money that you're going to get for your neighborhood you can get anywhere from five hundred thousand dollars to five million the speaker determines who is going to be chair of what committee speaker determines how much expense money you're going to get for programs in your district except for seniors and youth we all get 108 000 percent seniors and 151 000 for you but there's another category called local initiatives and if you're good with the speaker two three hundred thousand if you're bad with the speaker eighty thousand if the speaker's afraid of you like me a hundred and thirty thousand that's the game they play.

But but see i want to say this and i want to talk a little bit about barack obama and impact and the economics and what i think we need to do around these budgets speaking of budget time what can be done what can be a radical approach to a dealing with this budget this 3.6 trillion dollar national budget a 131 billion dollar state budget and a 60 billion dollar city budget you know new york city's budget would you believe is larger than 48 state budgets in the united states a city budget new york city's 60 billion dollar budget is larger than every african country's budget larger than every caribbean country's budget and this is a city where 62 percent of the population is people of color and this is a city run by a legislative body called the new york city council 51 members and 28 are people of color and 23 of white that's the breakdown.

So i wanted to mention the city council and the dictatorship of the speaker and get into more macro discussions on economics and what can happen uh in a capitalist society did y'all see that film uh capitalism a love story oh my goodness you know i i don't know how capitalists let him distribute it but i'll tell you capitalism wants money so badly that even if you beat them up and they can make profit off you beating them up they'll pay for it but looking at that when you look at city hall in this city what we can do as radicals and paul washington and i are working on a book called fired up black radical politics a vision for america give us a handclap whether you like me now just be nice black radical black radical black radical politics a vision for america and what we want to do with that is to show that black radicals can get into politics white radicals can too if you like can get into politics and make some changes and really have some impact.

So what we've done in the city council i wanted to let you know the power of the speaker and to show that if you do there's two things that people in power are afraid of number one is the mobilization of the masses a lot of people mobilized and willing to take things to the level they need to be taken and number two the media they're very very afraid of image and what can be said in the media it gets so ridiculous gifford miller used to have like on a particular issue he would have like 45 votes it's only 50 one of us he would already have all the votes because they do vote counting so he'll call me up and say uh councilman how are you voting i said gif come on now who are you talking to you know i'm voting the way i want to vote i'm voting my conscience i'm voting for my people i'm voting for my principles what's your problem and what are you calling me up for a vote for when you got 45 really don't matter how i vote what you're going to say to the media i'm going to say whatever i feel like saying but can't you just vote and be cool no i don't have a cool bone in my body i don't know how to be politically cool i try to make it as hot as i can for y'all.

When i vote 49 tony avala is the only one that votes me and tony abella we always have like it's 49 to 2. you know every development stuff first we tried to get them on development you know that's that's where a lot of the racism and gentrification and the use of eminent domain and displacing residents and displacing businesses comes through development bloomberg has turned this city over to the rich but at the systems with the assistance of uh christine quinn and the members of the city council because we the city council has the power over the budget would you believe that we passed the budget not the mayor everybody's talking about the mayor and you should don't vote for him if you're going to vote at all do you vote green party marine party ain't in this election not this one with with in new york yeah democratic reverend billy is ready francis villa okay see these are the things we need to discuss these are the things we need to have some serious discussion on because when we do all that and the dust clears you have no more power you have no more resources and you made your point you may have had your platform but we got to really discuss how we can have real serious impact and not just symbolism not just we're running so we can have a little platform for a few people or a party or you know that it's not working in my opinion it's not working and i think at some point if we are going to do a third party it has to be real it has to have a real chance of winning a real chance of having impact a real chance of at least having leveraged politics so even if you don't win you have leverage but in any event.

Point i was trying to make is that within this whole structure on power the ability to act in your own best interest power ability to make decisions that will impact you directly influence is when you have to persuade people in power to make decisions for you through demonstrating screaming and hollering and whatever you're going to do but to have actual power in the city council the city council passes the budget the city council passes all land use matters it has control over all of the city-owned land and what's to be developed on it if there's any rezoning to be done the city council passes on that and of course laws bloomberg as bad as he is and and he's horrible for so many reasons did not change the term limits law the city council did he influenced them twisted arms brought people off to get them to vote 29 of them in his favor but once again if we had more radicals in the city council and if you can get into the green party purple party any party do it but get in and don't just be running just to be running if we can get more of us in these positions you would be surprised how much of it can change and how much we can build a movement a radical movement in politics.

I want to mention a few people and i want to continue on the city council and then i'll be finished in a few minutes chokwe lumumba who is a revolutionary nationalist member of the republic of napa and the malcolm x organization he was very very closely associated with chokwe lumumba a radical black revolutionary one a city council seat in jackson mississippi jackson mississippi cynthia that's right you can clap for that one in jackson mississippi cynthia mckinney we got to get her back in office her and i are talking well y'all try green party we got to get any party to get her back in office in office cynthia and i are talking now about how she can get back in congress we need her back in congress especially now how many people are gonna go to palestine and you know how many people are going to champion those causes that's in this system cynthia was a real champion we got to get her back in office we can't let her stay out there because we need her voice we need her fight and we have several across the country now and that's what our book is going to focus on how we can get radicals in office to affect change and to still be radical not so you have to be cool to get in and then after we get in then we're going to do it no you got to be hot and radical bad mean getting in and after you get in continue and you can't produce.

They said to me some of the people that said to me you know you got to calm down you got to be cool you can't be too listen to that those very council members that told me that were just defeated themselves and they're no longer in office and i got more from my neighborhood east new york i welcome you all to come out there to see things that we did get i mean i said all kinds of things some things y'all wouldn't even like i said i wanted to slap the first white man i see for my black mental health at a reparations rally and and i said let the church say hey man i said after the after the sean bell around uh killing i said we're not the only ones that could believe people had a fit with that he said amen i mean i said i said more things as an elected official than i even said as a activist and still we have two new schools in our district because i got on the landmarks public sightings committee and they were we have about a 14 15 billion dollar capital budget to build schools and they're building them everywhere else but in east new york and harlem and bedstein in our communities i have two new 80 million dollar schools coming into east new york i have two new 14 million youth centers coming into east new york and i am the number one you can ask hpd you can ask the speaker who i fight all the time i am the number one city council member in affordable housing number one.

And the reason being once again is the question of power and i know i'm dealing on a micro level but it is a question of power that when a developer comes into my neighborhood he knows or she knows that if i don't support it it's not going to happen because once i say no all of my colleagues and i'm on the land news committee they're going to say no too so when they come to my neighborhood and they want to develop donald trump could come to my neighborhood and say i want that building on blake avenue he has to see me and i say you're fired he wouldn't get it and no matter how many billions he has he would have to see the local city council member why because the city council has the power to defend determine what's going to be developed on city-owned land.

You know how they do it i remember when i first got in this developer came to my office thought i didn't know what's happening i did a lot of studying before i got in he threw his little plane on my table and he said uh councilman uh i need your approval on this project threw it at me i said this meeting is terminated you haven't he said what's the problem i said leave don't disrespect me like that don't be throwing nothing at me i didn't mean no disrespect what you did and i made them wait a month for another meeting he came back a month later he said councilman i am so sorry i didn't mean to disrespect you but i just want to let you know that you know i'm building 74 units of housing i said you're not building anything until we have this conversation and then he tried to pull out these colorful pictures of the house and make it look all pretty i said uh put the pictures away how much is it gonna cost he said oh oh councilman these will be two family homes for 550 000 i said this meeting is terminated he said no no councilman wait wait wait i said that is not happening in my neighborhood.

He said well you know i said did you get your welfare it's interesting when corporations get free money it's cute name subsidies it's free money it's called subsidies where either we're on subsidies and you're on subsidies or when we get free money if we're on welfare then you're on welfare so i said go are you getting any welfare he said what you do mean i said free money from the government are you getting welfare he said oh you mean subsidies i said no i mean welfare how much he said 1.5 million dollars subsidies oh i said so that's about about two about 160 to 100 and someone thousand dollars per house you getting the government's free money he said uh yes councilman i said well you're at 550 000 let me tell you something it cost you 280 000 to build that house because i did the research oh yeah but councilman you understand i got to pay for this i got to pay for that the workers that's what we're going to get to the workers 260 or 80 000 at that time for you to build that housing you're already up to 550 and got subsidies to take 100 000 off each house so i'll tell you what i'm gonna do you a favor we're not gonna do 550 we're going to do 320. i'm going to let you make forty thousand dollars on every house how you like that forty thousand dollars he said uh well councilman can i get back to you i said sure i can next week he came back to the councilman um you know we got a deal uh 320 000. he said would you sign now i said no.

I said what is the ami what is the area median income the income that's required for a purchaser to have to get this house he said oh it'll be about 80 percent of the ami i said 80 of the ami 80 of the area median income for new york city is about 56 000 new york city's ami at that time was 72 000. it's about 76 000 now so 80 of that is 56 000 i said do you know my neighborhood ami do you know the neighborhood ami of east new york 26 000 so you're going to come into my community first you wanted to charge 550 000 and then you wanted to do 80s i said that's not going to happen so councilman then what do you say i said about 50 of the ami family of four making 35 to 40 000. he said all right now when you sign and said no who are you hiring to do the work and i'm not looking for jobs i'm looking for the contractors yes who are going who's going to do some of the subcontracting because i know you are gc you're a general contractor who's going to do the subcontracting because then we'll hire our own folk but we got the contracts make long story short when he finished i had jobs we had that's affordable housing that's how you keep housing affordable you don't let them come into neighborhoods and tell you that they're on they're going to do 80 20. that's the plan now in most neighborhoods 80 20 80 luxury 20 affordable and that 20 percent is 80 percent of the ami give me a handclap that was deep and i'm moving on you want to make a point i'll let you know when i get these just in case you miss it or you don't think so so just be nice.

Housing that's how we have to battle housing so we can march against affordable housing or for it we could screen for it we can write heavy stuff about it but if you have no power if you have no power to do something about it then no matter how much we scream and holler they're going to gentrify our neighborhoods they're going to come in with housing that's more luxurious the christie they building over the museum of modern arts a 70-story building it's going to be as tall as the chrysler building right and over the museum of martiner they're coming in with all kinds of plans to do this neighborhood that's why economically we can't just have a a deep analysis and critique we have to be involved in a radical way that we can alter the economic plans of this city within the next 10 20 years or else working class families poor black struggling latino asian families you could forget it you can forget living in new york city because of what they're doing.

Look what they do with the water bills you know this is a this is this place is insane water and electricity should be be free and they can do it they can do it you know one of the i was in the speaker's office the other day and they said charles you know you always out there talking about the speaker talking about the system that what would you do what would you do if you had a five billion dollar budget deficit and you had to balance the budget what would you do i said please give me that speaker's jobs i would show you you give me that speaker's job i'm telling y'all it is not difficult to balance a budget there's but a few things you can do to balance a budget no matter how large or small the budget is one you either raise revenue you have to get more income two you have to cut your spending they do good at that three you have to borrow four you're gonna have to sell off some of your assets property there's not but so much you can do whether your budget's a hundred dollars or a hundred billion dollars these are the things that you balance the budget.

So we had a 60 billion dollar budget last year we had a check this out the budget that i voted against is the year we had a 3.2 billion dollar surplus surplus and they wound up cutting social services cutting programs and i mean we were bleeding the cuts were so deep day care centers youth centers senior citizen centers cutting us down unemployment was going up black men was unemployed to the tune of 50 and and don't be fooled by unemployment figures because of the way they compute them they count on people getting unemployment insurance or benefits so if you're not getting any unemployment benefits you're not counting that's like half my neighborhood so we say the way you figure the unemployment stuff is those who are not in the workforce not in the workforce so if you come out to east new york and we got 60 000 people in my district that are 18 and over eligible to be in the workforce and you got 33 000 people working then nearly 50 of your people are not in the workforce whether they're receiving uninsurance benefits or not they're not working those are the people on the floor some people have never got into the workforce and they will not be counted so when you look at those figures in our neighborhoods if it's 14 15 percent by those who are receiving unemployment benefits you know it's at least 40 percent it's 30 and 40 unemployment in our neighborhoods and in many areas is 50 unemployment.

We look at those kinds of things that's happening in our neighborhoods and when we look at how we can balance this budget if you got and you can do this easily the mayor and the city council put away 2.5 billion dollars in a so-called healthcare retirement plan it is bogus it sits there because you know when you pass the budget not supposed to have any money that's not targeted to something that's why the speaker funded programs that didn't exist and she's still speaking right funded programs that did not exist it was it's common practice for speakers to fund programs that don't exist so that they have money after the budget is passed to buy off the other city council members for votes see they can't have they can't set money aside all 60 billion dollars has to be earmarked to something well we passed the budget so this and had a nerve to call it the veterans affairs fund put 2 million there doesn't exist but it's passed that money's in that line do a budget mod to switch it somewhere else so that they can pay off people for the rest of the year and then they have a nerve to start vetting our programs these little programs we give five and ten thousand dollars to in town neighborhoods now have to go through you know a whole lot of paperwork bureaucracy to make sure that they real program we didn't fund programs that didn't exist the speaker did.

So when we get in this is why we have to get inside and mix it up with them and let don't let them get away with this stuff it's better that you're inside handling that stay radical stay progressive i even i even spoke and i had they had the cranes business thing and i had all of the khan edison and all of them there and i said to them as they said uh councilman so what do you think some of the business solutions are i said we should we should nationalize khan edison and he said are you serious are you trying to say that we should be a socialist society absolutely absolutely and we can incrementally get there because i know y'all can't take the shock we can incrementally get in there get there by nationalizing khan edison nationalize them they should not be making profit off electricity nationalize nationalize them and give it back to the people then the one that really would get me thrown out of the country nationalize the automobile industry nationalize them see we should call for some nationalization because you know they did a they do little things like that remember otb the city used to own otb so they know how to do it they just you know follow follow that pattern and start nationalizing some industries because we should not as socialists or communists let me not even get into the labels i don't know who's who out here but whatever you are other than a catholic any capitalist here all right now as i was saying.

There's there's things we got to do to get them this i'm a firm believer that revolution can and will happen in america and i'm a firm believer that capitalism is a failure it never has worked can't work won't work and we can change this system radically and i want to see it in my lifetime people said oh that's not even real listen we can make some real things happen i believe it can happen and i'm very optimistic about it you know like people say hey well you know it'll never happen not in your lifetime we'll see because this stuff is not working it's not working.

You know here's the dilemma we're in if barack obama is successful in stabilizing this economy we're in trouble because successful means he'll be patching up capitalism trying to fix it they said we're in a crisis for black people we're saying what the hell are you talking about we've been in the class when y'all was when y'all thought y'all had it good we were in a crisis it's not us we're not we we're in a constant state of crisis so what i mean people say oh my god the economy we're saying what are they talking about our economy is we've been catching it ever since we got here so you know when y'all when y'all talking about you know the economy the economy is bad it's rough no kidding you know we we know that and when they fix it up.

And look at the contradiction there's a good book um called um the shock doctrine disaster capitalism what a game they play on you you know they have these conservative policies waiting for you they're waiting for you like in new orleans and i think she mentioned sri lanka and when the tsunami came and the capitalists really wanted they wanted to build tourist attractions on the shores there and and wipe out the fishing the fishes the fishermen industry they wanted to take the fishing industry out and bring in tourism so capitalism can make some money so here comes the tsunami it wipes out the the fishing industry and then they say wow the tsunami did what we've been trying to do all along instead of bringing the fishing industry back they bring in the tourist industry that they wanted all along.

In new orleans before katrina they were trying to privatize the school system to charter schools and they also wanted the public housing that was right next to the french quarters here comes katrina katrina destroyed a lot of the schools 120 smart schools public schools were destroyed now as they rebuild the school system is 60 some are charter schools and only four public schools then the public housing that was right next to the french quarters didn't get destroyed i went down there it wasn't good sam you was down there right the public housing was in good condition but they said hey we will take them down now and build some other stuff that they always wanted to do and then the bailing out even even if you're a capitalist you can't fail and get bailed out your business failed close down you're not supposed to bail out failures and then say if we don't give these failures not only the 800 billion dollars to turn the trillions but we also need to give them bonuses because if you don't give the bonuses out the good workers are going to leave if they were so good you and the fails you you can't you fail you fail you shut your business down and do something else give you smith bonnie whoever you are goldman said you failed.

You can't say i wish we could if black people could fail that business and get the government to bail us out man we should all get in business don't bail out wall street bail out 125th street bail out fulton street bail out the streets in our neighborhood how are you going to give 800 billion dollars and bush already gave 750 billion then barack comes with 800 billion you're not stimulating the economy that's stuff not trickling down to the hood it's not coming down to working-class people it's for shovel-ready projects anybody in here have a shovel ready project no because that's where the stimulus money goes the shovel ready project the only people that had the shuffles from the capitalists and they were ready to receive the money and it didn't trickle down to any jobs in our neighborhoods.

Barack obama for the black community some interesting things happening a lot of black leaders now are being promoted that are race neutral this is a post-racial society post-civil rights post-protest protest politics post ethnic politics post what until you post racism and post capitalism you cannot post black power you cannot post revolution you cannot post fighting against capitalism these things we must do but when they say that and i in the black community you're getting those like cory booker in newark deval patrick first black governor massachusetts barack obama first black president you know what a lot of whites in america are saying come on black people what are y'all fussing about we watch oprah winfrey she's black cosby we made him rich he's black listen white children can wear michael jordan's jersey he's black we like michael we like michael jackson we even let you deal with hip hop and we gave you a black president what is your problem how could you still call us racist isn't that progress child no no racism is institutionalized racism is structural.

Any time you have 44 presidents and 43 of them are white men 44 vice presidents and all 44 vice presidents are white men 100 senators there's only one black guy in there who took barack's place and we don't know how long he's going to be in there right incredible where are women in power where are people of color and powerful positions this is a racist sexist society so when we when we battle these things and when i'm looking at it i said all right the vault patrick all of them said you know be race neutral that way you can get whites to vote for you charles if you talk all that black stuff you're never going to go beyond the black community you will only be able to get elected in east new york you will only get elected in black neighborhoods that's all i want i'm trying i'm trying to go nowhere else i'm happy with that thank you but my question is let's do a study all right good strategy barack real good strategy you did it you got them to vote for you i supported them i said all right you know it's a great thing black children see a black president stretch the imagination that's a good thing critical support him or mccain wasn't a big it wasn't difficult him or hillary that wasn't that hard either but critical support see the black community can't sit back and let him do all of that stuff he's doing and not in the progressive community in a radical community.

I'm going down to washington on november 7th we're going to protest the afghan afghanistan war he needs to come bring bring the troops home shut the water down don't transfer it from one war to another and you know what i'm so angry about here they mad at robert mugabe and some of you we need to have some discussion on zimbabwe and what that really is about because a lot of white progressives and white left they don't understand zimbabwe either i got beat up by white because of mugabe you know you know everybody has their issues no one's perfect but y'all don't even know anything about most of the people that criticize mcgraw don't know anything about zimbabwe or it's history that's right clueless.

Here is a man who in 1980 united patriotic front united to beat britain now i find this interesting 1976 reverend herbert daughtry paul and myself protested against eon smith y'all know who ian smith is right yes uh murderer of black people killer colonized stole our land and called it rhodesia after cecil rhodes who was another murderer a big english businessman who took the gold of zimbabwe the diamonds of zimbabwe and they named that road scholar after him that's blood money you all know about the rogue scholar they have cecil rhodes and then eon smith a murderer comes to america invited by jimmy carter everybody loved jimmy carter and ian smith comes so he comes and jimmy carter was taking him to a play on broadway a murderer of black people we protested some of us got roughed up by the police we said you can't do this this is a murderer.

Here comes robert mugabe they have a guerrilla war they win britain says all right we've had enough you know white oppressors but then they're going to lose they negotiate and worse yet they'll grant you independence uh-huh you don't give your independence given us nothing they took it they went to lancaster house in england and they sat down and said all right now that we won we're going to be in power how will we deal with the land question malcolm x says the basis of freedom is land right land is the basis you don't have no land you're not free so they said we got to get the land back to the africans so what mogambe said how do you suppose we do that they negotiated it and they said willing seller willing buyer if the white farmers who own 90 of the land most of the white farmers in zimbabwe own seven and eight farms some of them ten times the size of central park they said if they're willing to sell it britain will buy it and give it back to the africa that's land reform.

Well robert mugabe said you know i ain't crazy about that but fine he allowed that for 20 years from 1980 to 2000. nobody called robert mugabe a name they had nothing bad to say about him willing seller willing buyer the farmer still owned 90 of the farms in zimbabwe and bravo agave was fine you know when he became a villain a dictator a despot all of this stuff in 2000 when he said you know this is not working and it was under pressure from the brothers and sisters that fought with him and said look you don't get our land back we won't take it and blood is gonna spill he said all right i'm changing the policy one farm one farmer you got seven farms take the one you like best because i'm taking the rest then robert mugabe was a dictator a terrorist can you imagine george bush said he was violating african people's rights in zimbabwe george bush was concerned about black people dying and zimbabwe and let the people die in new orleans but not zimbabwe.

When he changed that policy here come the bb bcc the brooklyn the british bbc that they came western press hit him so you know what i did i said uh you know what since y'all confused about zimbabwe and robert mugabe i went to zimbabwe i had a fact-finding miss y'all said all of this stuff i went to the farmers and asked them i said how did you justify keeping our land they said we loved our president for 20 years and so we started taking the land bank i went to the ambassador reynolds and i said ambassador reynolds what's the biggest problem in zimbabwe he said drought i said what's the second ambiguous right he said aids i said what's the third greatest brother the devaluation of the zen the the uh currency because capitalism and imperialism was strangling that's what they do when it's a cash go or whether it's a hugo chavez or a robert mugabe to try to strangle the economy they cut you off from the world bank and the international monetary fund hoping that your economy will crumble so your people will say the revolution didn't work and then they bring in the saboteurs and the those who destabilize revolution just rethink zimbabwe revisit it for those of you who don't understand the history.

Today south africa under mandela and anc 80 of the land is still owned by whites and robert mugabe 80 plus owned by the africans now in zimbabwe 80 percent plus don't end it with this i do believe we can win i do believe that we can make some radical changes i do believe that you should get an electoral politics where there's power not symbolic runs but runs that we could win and if you could win it through an independent party do it if you've got a registered democrat and strategize to get it like that because 90 of the area is democratic do it because then we can get in then we can have some power then we can make some decisions and fight for structural change it is then that we can also while we talking about our ideology and our philosophy you can also meet the needs of the masses that are suffering and need jobs and need houses we could do this y'all i just wanted to say power to the people keep the struggle going for whatever back would never we will win thank you very much you
