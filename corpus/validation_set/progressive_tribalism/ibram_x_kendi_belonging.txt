Good afternoon everyone. It's truly and truly an honor for me to be here before all of you. Thank you so much for coming out this afternoon. Thank you to the sponsors and to the organizers. I'm always just joyous when I'm outside of Washington DC. And certainly in a place like the Bay Area. And one of the reasons why I'm always joyous when I leave Washington DC is because I have to continuously hear someone say that they're the least racist person you've ever encountered, the least racist person you've ever interviewed. He has said that he's the least racist person you've ever met and then, he decided to take it to a whole nother level and say I'm the least racist person anywhere in the world.

But you know I didn't come here to talk about Donald Trump. And so let's just get him out the way. Is that cool? I came here to talk about those Americans who oppose Donald Trump, but also self identify like Donald Trump as not racist. And ironically Americans who self identify as not racist, whether they're conservatives, moderates, liberals, radicals, progressives, they don't realize. I think many of us don't realize that we are connecting ourselves to a history of slave traders who self identified as not racist, although they didn't use that term.

We're connecting ourselves to enslavers who said yes when we say black people should be enslaved. When we say slavery is a positive good, when we say slavery is a necessary evil, when we say that black people are the cursed descendants of Ham, those are not racist ideas, that's God's law. That's science's law, that's nature, that's logic. We don't realize we're connecting to Jim Crow segregationists who said I'm not racist, it's separate but equal down here. We're following the law. We're not racist. We're connecting to eugenicists who were really the first group of Americans to be classified as racist who also turned around and said this is science. This isn't racism. This is science. We have empirical data to demonstrate that black people are intellectually inferior by nature. Just look at their test scores.

And today we have white nationalists. We have white supremacists who self identify is not racist. We have white supremacists who before they go into a Walmart in El Paso Texas write a manifesto claiming that Latinx immigrants are invading Texas. And then also claiming I'm not racist. We have this long history of racists classifying themselves as as not racist, racists who cannot imagine that they have been reinforcing notions that there's something wrong with a particular racial group, racist who can't imagine that the policies and policy makers they're supporting are creating and reproducing racial inequity.

Fundamentally racism, its heartbeat, has always been denial. And the sound of that heartbeat has always been I'm not racist. To be more specific, the sound of that heartbeat has always been not racist. And so in writing How to be an Antiracist, I've had one singular goal. If I could somehow shape the world what I would hope that would come out of this book is very simply we would eradicate the term not racist from the American vocabulary. And then it would force people to recognize that there either what? Racist or anti-racist. It would force Americans, if we eliminated the term race neutral from the American vocabulary, to recognize that all policies are either racist or anti-racist. If we eliminated terms like racially charged. They use so many now I can't keep up with them, but I know that's one of them. If we eliminated all of those racially, whatever they call it, terms and realized all ideas are either racist or anti-racist. Then we can truly have an accounting of ourselves, of our ideas, of our policies, and of our country. Because at some point we are going to have to stop denying that we have metastatic racism. Because if you didn't already know, it is literally killing America. It is literally killing this world. The three lethal weapons that are threatening American existence, and human existence are of course nuclear war, climate change, and bigotry.

And so I, of course, was born and raised in New York City. I was born in Queens New York, Jamaica Queens New York. I was raised the child of two parents who were in the black power movement, specifically the black theology movement. They were walking around with their 'fro saying God is black and Jesus is black, and the church needs to be an engine of liberation, and we are practicing liberation theology, that our job as a Christian is to liberate black people. But by the time I came around the 'fros got a little lower. And they had risen a little higher in the economic ladder. And like other members of the civil rights and black power generation, they certainly maintained, my parents did, their liberation theology. But they also in the 1980's, like the black middle class more broadly, like the white middle class had historically done, they'd also began to imagine that they had moved into the black middle class. And a large segment of black people had not, because of what was right about them, and what was wrong about those black poor people.

And so what had emerged was this sort of dueling consciousness that there was nothing wrong with black people and we need to continuously challenge the racism of the Reagan era, while simultaneously these ideas that there was indeed something wrong with the black poor, that indeed there was something wrong with these black women having all these children, that there was something wrong with these black men committing all these crimes. And this was part of a larger American discourse that the reason why racial inequity was persisting after civil rights was not because the civil rights movement, and even the black power movement did not eradicate racism. Y'all know we talked about post racial now. Well they imagined that it was post racial by the mid 1970's. Or some would say the day Lynden Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, suddenly racism was eradicated. Yeah I mean we heard that when they said the day Obama was elected, suddenly racism no longer existed. One person walked into one office that was powerful, but one office, and suddenly I and none of the black, or Latinx, or Native people, or Asian people in this room were no longer subjected to racism.

It just so happened that racial inequities persisted after the election of Obama, just as racial inequities persisted, and even in many ways deepened for black poor people after civil rights. And so it was imagined that the reason being was because there was something wrong with these people. There was something wrong with these black people. And more specifically by the 1990's. If there was ever a decade in which black youth were seen as the fundamental American problem it was the 1990's. And so for anyone who grew up like I did, as a black youngster in the 1990's, we were seen as the problem from our parents and grandparents generations, to white America. Everyone was looking at us as the problem, the way we dressed, the list of music we listened to, the way we danced. All these ideas about something wrong with black youth, I consumed them, I internalized them. And ended up preaching them back to black folk when I was a senior in high school.

And so How to be an Antiracist opens with this scene where I am participating in this Martin Luther King oratorical contest in Prince William County. By that point we had moved from New York City to Northern Virginia. And I had won my high school competition, and went on to this countywide competition. And was one of the top three finalists, and the top three finalists were able to speak at MLK Day in 2000. And I used that platform, a day in which we were celebrating black youth, because we had three high school orators, and three middle school orators, all of whom were black. And the vast majority of the people in that auditorium of 3000 people were black. And I used my speech to condemn black youth, to say black youth don't value education, which was a widely circulating racist idea about black youth, even though there was no evidence.

I used that speech to say black youth are the most feared in society, as if it was was their fault they were so feared, as if they wanted to be hunted like they were super predators. I used that speech to imagine that black youth continued to climb the high tree of pregnancy, as it had been imagined by the previous two decades that the reason for the increasing percentage of black children born into single parent households was because single, typically teenage black girls and women were having too many babies. But we didn't realize that the actual cause of that increasing percentage of black children born into single parent households was because married black women were having less children. We didn't realize that. Because we as Americans have been taught that if you have a racial inequity, if you have a racial disparity, there must be something wrong with the people on the lower end. And it's our job as scholars apparently to figure out what's wrong with those people.

And so that's what I believed. I had internalized those ideas whole. And I ended up reaching them back to black people, the majority of whom applauded for me. And so I opened the text with that story, not only to sort of demonstrate just how deeply I had internalized anti-black racist ideas, but just how deeply many other black folk had internalized anti-black racist ideas. And just how deeply internalized racism has actually always been the real black on black crime. And some would say well, you know black people, I mean yes those ideas are not true, yes those are not ideas black people should be saying about black people, but I wouldn't classify those as racist ideas because black people apparently have no power.

So apparently black people are slaves. Because the only group of people who don't have any power are slaves who don't resist. And I'm not saying enslaved people, because these are people who have literally been enslaved by violence and terror, and are constantly resisting, and that's why they needed to be enslaved by violence and terror. I'm talking about people who are confined and oppressed and doing nothing in the face of that, not resisting, not recognizing that they have the power to resist. And every single human being in this world, in this country, in this city has the power to resist. But some Americans don't resist, They don't resist racist power and policy. In the face of all of these racial inequities from police violence, to health disparities, to educational disparities, to wealth disparities, they look at all these disparities and see normality, and see nothing wrong.

And if anything they say the cause of those disparities are the inferiorities of those racial groups. So what they do is they don't use their power to resist, because they've internalized racist ideas. That has always been the net effect of racist ideas on the human mind. It causes people to say yeah, black people should be 40% of the incarcerated population in this country, even though we make up only 13%. We should be that, because our neighborhoods are more dangerous, black people are more dangerous, black people are more violent. When you put Latinx and black people together they make up about two thirds of the incarcerated population, which is twice, about twice their makeup in the general population. And white people make up about a third, which is essentially one half of their population in this country.

So then people understand that yeah, black and Latinx people are dangerous animals. So they should be enslaved at that, they should be incarcerated at that clip. And apparently white people, including white people with AK-47's, are safe. Those racist ideas cause us to look at this problem and not see anything wrong with it, continuously drive by poor or black and latinx neighborhoods and not see anything wrong with that, see that the cause of that poverty, the cause of those lack of resources and opportunities is not policies, it's not racism, there's something wrong with the people. They don't want to save, they don't want to work hard, they prefer welfare, there's something wrong with the people. Those are racist ideas talking in our minds, causing us to not resist racism, to imagine that racism, or I should say more so racial disparities should exist.

And so fundamentally anyone, any person who is thinking that the problem is black people, that the problem is Latinx people, that the problem is Asian or Native people, even the problem that it's white people. Anyone who is thinking that the problem is a racial group, and their cultural or behavioral inferiority, and not recognizing that the problem is racist power and policy is being racist. An anti-racist obviously is looking out at our society and saying you know what, there are ethnic differences, there are cultural differences coming out of those ethnic differences. I'm going to level that difference. I'm not gonna judge that difference from my own cultural standard. But all of those racialized groups are equals. There's nothing wrong with black women. There's nothing wrong with the Native poor. There's nothing wrong with Asian professors. There's nothing wrong with any racialized group. And if there's a disparity between racial groups, it must be because of racist power and policy. And therefore an anti-racist, instead of looking and trying to figure out what is wrong with people, an anti-racist is trying to figure out what is wrong with policy.

But not just what's wrong with policy, what's wrong with those individuals who have the power to institute and shape policy, policymakers. So when I talk in How to be an Antiracist, I often times in the book used the term racist power. And when I talk about racist power, I am fundamentally talking about people who are in positions of power in which they can institute, shape, eliminate policies. And they use that policy, I should say they use that position of power, to institute, defend, and shape policies that lead to racial inequity, that lead to racial injustice. That is racist power. And I contrast that with anti-racist power. And anti-racist power is not just those anti-racists who historically as a result of social movements, who historically is a result of their own political campaigns, have been able to seize positions of power and have used those positions of power to deliver policies that reduce inequities, that create equity. Not just those who anti-racist policymakers, but anti-racist power is the power of the people, the power of the people to resist, the power of the people to resist racist policies, the power of the people to resist racist policymakers.

And I just get so upset when we imagine that only people like Donald Trump have power, when we imagine that only white people have power, when we imagine that white people and Donald Trump are all powerful, when we recognize that to say anyone, or any group of people, are all powerful is essentially to call them gods. And so we're imagining that these people are gods. And for those of you who are religious you just can't beat God right? I mean there's just no way you're gonna beat God. So you might as well just stop and let God continue to have his or her way. And so then it breeds this pessimism, it breeds this notion that racism is fundamentally permanent. It breeds this idea that racism is natural to humankind.

Yes, everywhere we look there's racial disparities. Everywhere we look there's racist policies. Everywhere we listen we hear racist ideas. But that doesn't mean that racism is natural and even normal. It's normal because it's been made normal. Racism is only roughly 600 years old. Humans have lived a long time before we started imagining that the people who cover Africa, or all of those diverse ethnic groups are one race, that the people, all those diverse peoples in Europe are one race. Humans lived a very long time before we imagined these continental races. And we imagined that those continental races, that certain ones were superior an inferior. When we sort of started connecting those continental races to behavioral traits, when we started imagining, I should say that you know what those African people's can be enslaved.

And we Portuguese slave traders who initiated the transatlantic slave trade, we can make a ton of money off these people. And abroad we have to create a justification for why we're exclusively slave trading African people in the mid 1400's. Oh, because they're inferior, because they're beastly, because we're actually trying to civilize them. And then these racist ideas then became the justification for these racist policies, these racist policies that were instituted out of self interest. This really is a new phenomena, as much as it's old and widespread. And so I think it's critical for us to be very very specific when we talk about racism. And that's one of the things that I've been trying to do with my work, is to add a layer of specificity, specifically to how we describe racism. The words we use to describe the multi-layered phenomena that is racism.

And what I mean by that is the way that I like to sort of talk about this issue called racism, is you have racist power, you have racist policies, you have racist ideas, and you have racial inequities. And understanding the relationship between all of those is really understanding the way racism operates. And so I actually define racism as a powerful collection of racist policies that lead to racial inequity, and are substantiated by racist ideas. And I define a racist individual as someone who is expressing a racist idea, or supporting a racist policy with their actions or even inaction. And the reason why someone expressing a racist idea in that moment is being racist, is because in that moment they're thinking the problem is a group of people, as opposed to policy. And obviously the reason why someone who is supporting a racist policy is being racist is because their action is causing racial inequity. And the reason why someone who is doing nothing in the face of racist policy, that is pretty much the status quo in this country, is because they are allowing that racist policy to persist. They are allowing that racial inequity to pass on to another generation.

When we look at the enslavement era, what slaveholders wanted from non slave owners, from Northerners, in the face of slavery was to do one thing, nothing. That's what they wanted. They wanted you to do nothing. What did Jim Crow segregationists want? They wanted people to do nothing. What do people who benefit from mass incarceration, because they're able to make seemingly blue states into swing states, and swing states into red states. They want us to do nothing. The purpose of racist ideas is to get people to do nothing. And so when you do nothing, like someone who does nothing on election day, it's literally having a political impact. And that impact is the persistence of racism. And so there's no side line to this struggle. There's no viewing box to this struggle. We are all in this struggle.

What are we doing? Are we doing nothing, or doing something that's allowing racial inequity to persist, allowing racist policies to persist? Is that what we're doing? Or are we being an anti-racist? Then I define an anti-racist as someone who is expressing an anti-racist idea, or supporting an anti-racist policy with their actions, someone who is stating that there's nothing wrong with any of the racial groups, someone who was recognizing the equality of difference, someone who was pushing back against misleading statistics, against faulty premises that make some sort of case that there's something genetically, culturally, or even behaviorally wrong with a particular racial group, someone who's saying no, we're not just created equal, we are equal. That's being an anti-racist, that's expressing anti-racist ideas. And obviously someone who's supporting anti-racist policies that are leading to racial inequity.

And when I say support, you have some people who have a ton of money but they don't have much time. And they recognize that. And so they literally financially support institute's like the Hass, all sorts of organizations that are actually identifying and challenging racist policies. You have people who don't have a lot of money, but they have time. And so they dedicate their time, they volunteer for organizations. And then of course unfortunately, you have a lot of people who ain't got no time and no money. And that's a little bit more complex. But one thing I wanted to sort of say is that these two terms, racist and anti-racist, I said someone who is. These are not fixed categories. These are not tattoos. These are not identities. This is not who a person is. These are descriptive terms describing when a person is saying a racist idea, they're being racist. Describing when a person is saying an anti-racist idea, they're being anti-racist. Describing when a person is supporting a racist policy, they're being racist. Describing when in the very next moment they're supporting an anti-racist policy, so they're being anti-racist.

One of the things I think, one of the greatest misnomers about the term racist is that it is a pejorative term, it is literally an attack term, it is something that is in one's bones, it's in one's heart, that only bad people can be racist, that only people who wear hoods can be racist, that only people in the Klu Klux Klan can be racist, no. There were abolitionists who were racist. There were civil rights activists who are racist. There were people shoving black lives matter who didn't really believe all black lives matter. Y'all know what I'm talking about right? They just believed black men matter, but they didn't believe black women matter. Or they believe black heterosexuals matter, but didn't believe black gays and lesbians matter. Or they believe black elites mattered, but didn't believe black poor people mattered. Oh they believe black cisgendered people mattered, but not black transgender women.

And so it doesn't matter your identity. It doesn't matter your political affiliation. It doesn't matter whether you marched with King. I get that a lot, I'm sorry. All that matters is what you're doing in each moment. And the beauty about that is it then allows people, it allows us to admit, to confess, to say you know what yes. In that moment I did feel fearful when that young black male was passing me by in the street. Yes, in that moment I recognized that that fear was sourced in racist ideas. I recognized that that black male was trying to get home just like me. I recognized that I was being racist in that moment. And that is the distinction between a racist and an anti-racist. The racist, no matter what is said about them, no matter how they're charged with being racist, they are always going to deny it. While an anti-racist will take these definitions of a racist idea, of a racist policy, and of a racist and apply their behavior to it. And say you know what? I was being a racist. I was, but I'm going to change. That's the distinction.

And we have the capacity to change. We have the capacity to change ourselves. We have the capacity to change this country. I should say 99% of us have the capacity to change. I don't know about a certain character I live near. But finally, and I'll say in closing that the reason why I emphasize the capacity to change, the capacity that we have to change as individuals, the capacity we have to change in terms of policies, in terms of the very underpinnings and structures, and systems of this country, of this world, is because we have to believe that change is possible in order to bring it about. We have to. We have to believe that. And we have to believe that even though this country has metastatic racism, and even though those tumors of racial inequity have literally spread to every part of the body politic, and that were likely to die, that the overwhelming odds state that we will die, and that it's gonna a painful death. Despite those odds we still have to believe that we can heal from racism, we still have to believe that.

I should say that I'm speaking from experience. Last year, as some of you may know, I was diagnosed with with stage four metastatic colon cancer, a disease that kills 88% of people in five years. And the odds clearly were completely against me. The disease had spread. But if I would have said, first if I would have said I don't have cancer. And the way we get rid of cancer is by not talking about it. First I had to acknowledge that it was that bad. I first had to acknowledge that. And then I first, as we have to do with racism, have to acknowledge that in order for us to heal ourselves from this, individually and as a society, that we're gonna go through some pain. And that pain is essential to healing, and that there's another side to that pain. And we have to believe, even when we're going through that pain that we can be healed. Because what else is going to get us through that pain other than a belief that we can be healed, even when the odds are completely against us? What else other than that belief?

And so I challenge each of you to stop, if you are, denying that you have cancer, the cancer of racism. To recognize, that once you accept that you have that, that the process of healing is gonna be painful. But there's another side to that pain. It is the side in which you're basically no longer enslaved by racist ideas. It's deciding which you can be a part of a fight that's going to create a different type of America, a different type of America where racist policies are not just harming people of color, but also arming white people. A different type of America where the cronies of racism, all of the bigotries that intersect and reinforce, and are reinforced by racism, like sexism and homophobia, and a series of others will no longer exist. Because in order for us to truly be anti-racist we have to recognize that every single form of bigotry is wrong. And in order to create a different type of society we have to challenge all forms of bigotry. And we have to believe that that is possible. And I believe it, I believe it. Thank you.

[Question and Answer responses]

I think that in many ways we can do an accounting, not only of ourselves but of our institutions. What I mean by that is we can assess whether there's inequities in our institutions, in our neighborhoods. And stop blaming, let's say inferior black people for those inequities. Start saying okay there must be some sort of policies that are causing this. And then try to figure out two things. First, what those policies or lack thereof are, and then who has the power to essentially change those policies, to institute those policies. And then we decide are we going as individuals to essentially ensure that we're going to put ourselves on a path to get into that position of power, so we can then use that position to transform those policies, and thereby that institution? Or are we going to decide that we're gonna be a part of that internal group in that institution, that probably already exists right now, that is challenging those policies, that is challenging power?

So when we think about power, either we're going to challenge power, or we're gonna replace power. And I think each of us as individuals can sort of decide what role we're going to play. But I think in order for us to even get to that point, when we're challenging, or even replacing power, we first have to recognize that we have the power to resist, to challenge. And we have the capacity to basically play chess, to get into that position of power. I say chess and I'm like, I recently binge watched Game of Thrones. And I'm now watching Power, which is almost like a form of Game of Thrones. And what's amazing about these two shows for me is it really shows the dance that power basically exists that we're in that right now. We're in a power struggle, we're in a Game of Thrones right now in this country. And the question is always gonna be who is gonna be in those positions of power? Who is gonna be challenging those those forces of power?

And so I think that that's something that we can do. But at the same time we have to be fundamentally deeply self aware and deeply self critical. And I think that's one of the things that just people struggle to really do. And you don't have to do with anybody. Meaning you ain't got to tell nobody your critiquing yourself. You don't got to do like I do and say it to the world. You could just do it to yourself, nobody even has to know. I wish I could be you and nobody sort of knows my most shameful moments, nobody knows those times in which I was berating black people at the same time I was imagining I was serving black people. Nobody has to know that. But you have to know that. And you have to be the one that changes.

I do think that, I remember when I first started talking about this book. And from the beginning we had the term, we thought that sort of How to be an Antiracist was gonna be the title. And we started talking about that title with people. And initially people were like, there's no way people are gonna buy the book, not buy a book which on the cover it says How to be an Anti-racist. A month later on The New York Times bestseller list, obviously there's there's a segment of Americans, and that's of all races, who are willing to self reflect, who are serious about creating this sort of nation, not only of equity, but as Professor Powell stated, a nation of belonging, and justice, and freedom. And I've seen that, and I'm seeing that through traveling across the country in people who've been expressing, and been looking in the mirror.

I mean obviously efforts to create universal health care. For me, obviously it's deeply personal to me. If I didn't have healthcare, health insurance. I wouldn't necessarily be here right now. Obviously the movements against police violence and mass incarceration, and even mass deportation. Obviously the beginning recognition of something that finally people are calling white supremacist domestic terrorism, which apparently has been happening in this country since we arrived in 1619. And 400 years later we're finally able to actually call a bird a bird. I think we should acknowledge that. And so I think that there are movements. There are shiftings of narratives. And there are individual people and even institutions that are reflecting and seeking the change. And those are the types of things that give me hope.

Sure. In How to be, I describe racism and capitalism as the conjoined twins, so the same body, two different faces, two different personalities. And to this question of can you have anti-racist capitalist policies. So what could happen is we could reduce or eliminate inequities between white elites and black elites, between the black poor and the white poor, and between white working people, and black working people, and Latinx working people, and Asian and Native working people. But then you would still have these classes, in other words you'd still have black elites and the black poor. And the black elites would be justifying their class position based on racist ideas about the black poor. I don't think people recognize that. The way in which people, even white elites imagine that they are healthy, they are good, and poor people are trash. Poor white people are trash.

I don't think we even imagine the way in which ideas to justify class position are fundamentally racialized. So if we eliminate, for instance, disparities as stated between the races in the classes, we're not going to eliminate the classes themselves, which of course are a function of capitalism. And so I don't know how someone can truly be anti-racist and a supporter of capitalism.

So I think one of the things that I realized about how I defined the terms racist and anti-racist, I didn't even realize this until finishing the book. You know you finish something you're like oh man I wish I'd put that in there. And it was this, I realized that we commonly center, we commonly are very perpetrator centered in using and defining the term racist. And we're perpetrator, as opposed to victim centered. Let me give an example. If someone is preying on black women, people respond to it differently if the perpetrator is a black male than if it's a white male. If it's a white male it's understood as a racial issue. If it's a black male it's understood as a gender issue. Even though that those black women are both racialized and gendered.

And so I think that what's critical for us to do, is for us to fundamentally focus on the victims. What is being said about this group? What is being done about this group? And that then determines whether the person is racist. It doesn't really matter. And so me, when I entered graduate school, as I talk about in the book, I believed that black people couldn't be racist. I believed that I was not racist. But I thought that there was something deeply wrong with black women. And not women, not white women, but black women. And on the same token, when I entered into graduate school I thought that there was something deeply wrong with black queer community. Not queer people, even though I did think there was something wrong queer people too. But I specifically thought that there was something wrong with black queer people.

And again, because I was a black male, I didn't even understand how I could essentially be racist. Even though I'm not saying there's something wrong with women, I'm saying something wrong with black women. Even though I wasn't thinking about something being wrong with queer people, I was thinking there was something wrong with black queer people. And so for me, since I was so perpetrator centered, and because I had consumed ideas by white people about black women, as black men and other groups have done since the beginning of this country. I didn't even see the way in which I had been duped. I had been made into a fool. I had been essentially disconnected from the very people who made me.

And it wasn't until these two queer black women, who pretty much dominated. And I use dominated in a positive sense. And what I mean by dominated, like the discourse, the graduate student discourse. They were just not going to allow somebody like me to say anything. And the fortunate thing is I noticed that before I said anything. Because I saw what they said to other folk when they came at them and denigrated black women, when they denigrated black lesbians, when they denigrated black transgender women. And they came for those people. And when I say came, they didn't come for them in this sort of aggressive mean way, even though it felt that way to the person, and it felt that way to me, I felt like I was being attacked when they were talking like this.

And so for me watching that, watching and witnessing that, I did not want to be on the other side of that, I just didn't. And for those of you who may know Kaila Story and Yaba Blay, the two women I'm talking about, you'll know why. And so for me I decided that I wanted to actually learn, and read up all of those black feminist writers, all those black queer writers they were talking about, they were citing. And so, I mean they changed my life. Because there's no way, even though I imagine grad school and I'm here for the people. I'm a radical, and I'm about black liberation. No I wasn't about black liberation. I was about black male liberation. I was about black heterosexual liberation. And that's not the black community. And I had to be confronted with that fact.

I had to be confronted with anytime we say there's anything wrong with a particular racial group we're being racist, and then we're not seeing, for instance, disparities between black men and black women. Just like we're not seeing disparities between black women and white women. Because we're imagining that those disparities are normal. Because there's something wrong with black women. And so we're only ending up just fighting disparities or inequities between people in general, or between male groups. And so for me, like I said they changed my life. And they they provided me with an intersectional perspective, and I would argue that you cannot truly be an anti-racist if you're not a feminist. This isn't necessarily my area. I don't feel as comfortable saying this. But I would surmise you can't be a feminist unless you're an anti-racist.

And to truly sort of be about gay liberation, about the liberation of transgender black women who are literally experiencing a genocide right now. We have to recognize that anytime we're blaming those transgender women for their own deaths, that's no different than people blaming Michael Brown for his own death. Even though people separate the two, there's no separation. And then we don't see that many of the people who are actually killing these black transgender women are other black people. And we don't understand the way in which they're targeting black transgender women, not white transgender women. And how this is as much a racial issue as it is an issue of transphobia, because it's their intersection. And so I, of course, recognized that. And that's why the book, follow an intersectional theory. And there was no way I was gonna be able to write this book, and even strive to be anti-racist without speaking about it from an intersectional perspective.

So I think in my talk one of the things I was trying to emphasize is that an anti-racist is recognizing that they're going to constantly make mistakes. The difference though is an anti-racist will admit the mistakes, and she can try of course to not do them again, all the while knowing they're human. So they'll probably make that mistake again. While a racist will of course deny that they made the mistake to begin with, and thereby continuously make it, and then continually deny that they're making it. And so I think that mistakes are normal, we're human. The question is always, when we make those mistakes how do we respond? And that's not just a question of being an anti-racist or racist. That's a question for Humanity, for with anything. When we make a mistake how do we respond?

And those who are constantly growing and striving to be a better form of themselves are constantly recognizing and admitting their mistakes, and constantly seeking to be better for them. And so I think that we should take the pressure off of our backs to essentially be perfect. But we should simultaneously do that for other people. And so an anti-racist doesn't just recognize that they're gonna make mistakes. They're gonna allow other people to make mistakes. And again the question is not whether they made the mistake. The question is what they do after the mistake that's gonna then determine how we see them. And so for me, because of the work I do people regularly say things that are racist to me. And I don't get upset, or angry at that. But when I point that out, and then the person denies that what they just said was racist, okay then, depending on, and so it's a different type of thing.

And I think we have to allow people to make mistakes. And then with some people, I allow them to make multiple mistakes. And part of it is, is it the type of person who we are seeking to sort of help? And what I mean by help, help nurture in the way others have nurtured us. And if it's that type of person, and we've made that decision, then that means we have to allow that person to constantly make mistakes. And I think that's part of being an anti-racist. And what that means is we cannot get exhausted at the regularity of our mistakes, and the mistakes of people around us, because we should take that for granted, we should expect it.

We should expect, one of the things that I'm surprised about with people is with people who claim that they are woke. People who claim that, yeah you know, we're living in a world of global white supremacy. I mean I didn't mean to use that tone. But everybody knows what I'm saying, somebody who recognizes and talks about the persistence and the pervasiveness of racism. They say they see this and recognize this. But then when racism shows itself they're shocked. They're like oh my God, what the heck, there's a racist. Oh my God I'm so hurt, I feel so offended, this is hard. I mean I'm not trying to make fun of anyone. But seriously, either we recognize that racism is persistent, and pervasive, and predominant, and in doing so when it shows itself we are not surprised, we are not hurt. We, of course, see a sense of mission for us to challenge that.

And so I think that that's what it truly, when you we truly believe that this nation is, that we truly have metastatic cancer, when we see those symptoms within ourselves, within the nation, we're not going to be surprised. And I think that we have to get to that point. And that's why I'm deeply in this work, and I can still smile, because I recognize that I'm gonna see ugly racism every day. And it's not gonna take away my joy.

And I mentioned how when I entered graduate school that I was a racist, sexist, homophobe. And they were two queer black women who did not stand for that, but they still took me under their wing. They befriended me. And they befriended me because they saw something in me I didn't see in myself. And they decided that they were going to be loving to me. And that they were gonna allow me to make mistakes. And they were gonna allow me to grow. And so I owe them everything that I am as a result of their ability to take in someone like me into their loving arms. And I think that's what we have to do.
