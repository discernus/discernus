"Modernizing America's infrastructure won't happen without modernizing the way we finance infrastructure."

Since the passage of the bipartisan Infrastructure Bill and the Inflation Reduction act, the time to invest in American infrastructure projects, in my opinion, has never been better. And I'm hopeful that many of the successes that we've already achieved together are just the beginning of a public private partnership revolution in the United States.

It's about time that we brought the United States in line with the rest of the world.

When we took office, our roads and bricks were crumbling. We launched an infrastructure initiative all across the state, taking a balanced, all-inclusive approach to infrastructure investment. I'm proud that we made Maryland into both a national and an international leader, in using innovative solutions to address pressing infrastructure concerns. We moved forward on nearly all of our state's highest priority transportation projects in every single jurisdiction.

All across our state we made record investments in roads, bridges, tunnels, transit systems, ports and airports. We replaced and repaired every structurally deficient bridge. We resurfaced nearly 100% of the entire state highway system.

As one of the first governors of America to embrace P3s for infrastructure, one thing that we realized was that both state, and particularly local issues and interests, often created more of a headache for investments than national politics did. Many times we found that having partners who knew how to navigate state local government entities were some of the most valuable allies in trying to get large infrastructure projects approved.

So we incorporated state and local advisors into the working group that could anticipate concerns raised by hyper local interests, that could easily derail or delay projects. After a year-long effort, I got all 50 governors to agree on a series of recommendations, including four main pillars.

First was to relieve congestion to boost economic competitiveness. We insisted that the states be granted maximum flexibility to relieve congestion and to invest in adaptable and innovative solutions.

Second, enhancing efficiency by eliminating red tape and integrating smart technology. We pushed for a two-year goal for completion of environmental reviews and a 90-day timeline for related project authorizations.

Third, we focused on protecting America's critical infrastructure against not only traditional threats, but also emerging cyber threats. We recommended that Congress make investments in both resiliency and security.

And fourth, and in my opinion the most important and most impactful, was to advocate for the financing of infrastructure projects through private sector investment.

We stressed that states needed maximum flexibility to harness the full potential of the private sector to be a part of America's infrastructure future and through P3s. Government - whether federal, state or local - simply cannot afford what it will take to address all the gaps that exist in our collective investment in American infrastructure.

Each of these pillars and nearly all of our recommendations were included in the final Infrastructure Bill, which passed through Congress with bipartisan support.

Often times, when I was NGA Chairman, I would meet with governors across the country, both Republicans and Democrats, who frankly knew very little about private financing for infrastructure. It's important for potential investors to know that some of the biggest decision makers in America are often times state and local politicians and bureaucrats, who are still not yet sold on the benefits of P3s and infrastructure financing.

I still believe that America's best days are ahead, and we have shown the path to modernizing America's infrastructure. It starts with modernizing the way we finance our infrastructure projects. America is a country that was founded on innovative solutions and a spirit of optimism. I firmly believe that what we've started together is blazing a trail for others to follow.

Now it's time for us to just get the rest of America on board.

State, local governments and the federal government are not going to be able to accomplish all the things, no matter how much money they try to invest. They're finding they're running out of funds. People are tightening their belts rather than investing more in some cases, which is all the more reason why we need to tap into the vast amount of private sector money that's willing to invest in infrastructure.

The last thing any politician, whether they're progressive, Democrat or conservative, probably wants to do is raise taxes. And when they have revenue shortfalls and increasing expenditures and capital needs, I think there's never going to be an easier time to persuade them that, hey, we have a solution.
