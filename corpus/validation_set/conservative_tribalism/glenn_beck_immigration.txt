[Music] Hello, America, and welcome to the Glenn Beck program. I want to talk to you, um, about in a roundabout way, the things that were talked about last night, except we didn't really talk about them. And as you will see by the end of this hour, we really need to talk about what is happening in our country. One of the most controversial policy proposals apparently that Donald Trump has talked about this election is something that shouldn't be controversial at all, but the left and the mainstream media are absolutely freaking out. If you know history, they should not be. The proposal is mass deportation. And after you see what I'm about to show you, you make the call. I, I truly believe this may be our last chance. Um, the decision that's going to be made in four or five weeks is a decision that may decide whether we live in peace or mourn another 9/11 kind of attack, or if our Republic even stands. This topic is very, very serious. The case for mass deportation is not racist, nor is it heartless. It is honestly, as J.D. Vance said in the debate, common sense. And we don't have much time left before the unthinkable happens. As I'll show you later in the show, you do not want to miss any of this episode.

Now this is not an abstract issue anymore. Uh, it never was for border communities, but now it is a national threat that the entire country is now experiencing. And catastrophe is coming. Now there are two words that I want you to keep in mind throughout tonight's show, and it's these two: asymmetric warfare. What is that? Well, warfare between opposing forces which differ greatly in power, and that typically involves the use of unconventional weapons or tactics. We've seen this for the last 25 years. The kinetic hit-and-run tactics, guerrilla warfare, IEDs, uh, terrorism, Saddam's, uh, Republican Guard, the Al-Qaeda terror cells. All of these things in Iraq. Saddam's Republican guards threw their uniforms off and fought disguised as civilians. In Bin Laden's Al-Qaeda cells, they split all around the entire world, blended into the population, and waited for the order to activate. These are examples of kinetic asymmetric warfare. And later on in the program, I'll show you how our enemies are using immigration and our open borders to attack us. It is coming and the threat has never been more close. Over the weekend, Israel successfully killed the leader of one of the largest terrorist organizations in the entire world, Hezbollah. I say one of because the largest terror organization in the world, and it's not even close, is an entire country, Iran. And they are the ones holding Hezbollah's leash. Hezbollah has been planning asymmetric warfare for nearly half a century. And I'll show you later in the show, they have established a beachhead in South America. Why this isn't the biggest story in the northern hemisphere, I don't know. But they've held meetings and they are coordinating with our enemies in South American countries that are hostile to the United States. Asymmetric warfare is what they do best. Establishing and operating terror cells is what they do. Now, how many of them are currently in the United States? How many just walked across the border due to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's policies? Israel was absolutely right to take out the head of Hezbollah. They understand all too well that they have a bloodthirsty enemy directly on their border. But our own politicians don't, or they do and they have different goals. I know they have the same information that I have and that you will will have in the next hour. So what is the reason they're turning a blind eye? Because if you turn a blind eye, it's going to make it much, much worse. Is it that our own elected leaders are involved in another form of asymmetric warfare, a political form of warfare? I have talked about American asymmetrical warfare in the past, um, at the political version, and it's Cloward and Piven. Overwhelm and collapse. Welfare, healthcare, mass mail-in voting, Green New Deal, open borders. Just spread ourselves so thin that we eventually collapse, to collapse into a new system that is already planned and ready to go. Kamala Harris is in such a tough interview over the Democratic battleground of NBC MSNBC. And she was talking about how she would address the communities that have been devastated by the border crisis. She first mentions the failed immigration bill that would have actually made the situation much, much worse. But then she says this, "And my pledge is that when elected President, if the American people will have me, I will bring that bill back and I will sign it into law. And we need a comprehensive plan that includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border, but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship." Records amounts of illegals pouring over the border with no end in sight. And the current plan by the left is to make as many of them citizens as quickly as possible. Now, how does that address the things like what's happening in cities all over the country like Springfield, Ohio? How does that fix a city of 50,000 suddenly dealing with an influx of about 20,000 noncitizens? How does that help their public services that are overwhelmed, the hospitals, police, fire, schools, food, jobs, housing? And this is the same for communities all across America right now. If it hasn't happened to your town, it will. Last week, the L.A. Times reported in the middle of the biggest illegal alien crisis in our lifetime. The, the United States is approving citizenship applications at the fastest speed in years. Now, is that what we need right now? Just quick, let's make everybody a citizen. Is that what we need as cities are being overwhelmed, as border communities are on the brink of collapse, as war with terror organizations, uh, are happening all over the world and they have operatives on our borders that are ramping up, up unlike ever before? The answer to these questions is obviously, of course not. Unless the entire idea is asymmetric warfare to overwhelm and collapse. And we know how the left in the media will ultimately attack us for talking about this. They're going to call us racist and bigots. They'll call us literally Hitler. There are two words that I cannot use on today's show. I'll point them out to you later. Otherwise, we the algorithms will demonetize us and make sure that nobody really sees this. But what if you're, what if, what if one of your, one of your own in the biggest city in the country says this, "This issue will destroy New York City. Destroy New York City. We're getting 10,000 migrant a month. One time we were just in Venezuela. Now we get Ecuador. Now we getting Russians speaking coming through Mexico. Now we getting, um, Western Africa. Now we getting people from all over the globe have made their minds up that they're going to come through the southern part of the border and come into New York City. And everyone is saying is New York City's problem. Every community in this city is going to be impacted. We got a $12 billion deficit that we're going to have to cut. Every service in this city is going to be impacted. You're going to feel this beginning in 2025 and beyond, especially if it continues." Now that's New York City Mayor Eric Adams actually stating the truth, the obvious. That was one year ago last September. Now, 12 months later, this happened. Adams is being indicted for corruption. What was, was, was he having his family do multi-million dollar business deals in places like China or Ukraine or Romania or Kazakhstan? Was his information or administration levying, uh, leveraging the Justice Department to keep his children out of jail and using crack and ordering hookers where we have all of the evidence we need? Was his entire family getting secret payments through a shady lawyer to allegedly conceal the multi-million dollar deals? No. Well, not exactly. Details are still coming out. But the details we have, it sounds like he got a few airline and hotel upgrades before he was mayor. When will they learn? You have to have your son accept the bribes and then you launder through your family. Don't also talk about the effects of illegal immigration. Your fellow Democrats will leave you alone if you just don't say anything. Play ball. President Trump has proposed a plan that could begin to fix this entire dumpster fire, but time is running out faster than you might think. I'm going to give you a little bit of history and show you the plan and what's actually happening next.

[Music] So literally every day we move closer to potential war with countries like Russia and China, even North Korea. Um, just the, just the ports closing in three weeks. You're going to feel this intensely in three and four weeks. We will be on, uh, we'll be on a course that will lead us right to the same kind of thing we were dealing with COVID, uh, inflation, and products that aren't there. 93, I think it's 92 or 93% of all of our medicine, our drugs come through those ports. Great. So what's going to happen in two or three weeks if this continues? What happens to the medical community? What happens to our medicine? What happens to the sick people?

All right, um, let me show you President Trump about a week ago on part of his plan for mass deportation. Watch. "I'll take it out of the military because this is an invasion. Uh, if you remember, you know, I built hundreds of miles of wall. You know, much of it I built through the military. I took it out because I considered it an invasion of our country and I'll do it through the military if I have to. Okay?" Funding the entire operation is, but part of his plan, but the rest of the details haven't fully come out yet. Trump has stated in the past he's ready to declare the border crisis an invasion and invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. This would open up the possibilities of Red State Governors to draw resources from the National Guard. Just the mere fact that I had to say Red State Governors, not all governors, that he would have to jump through all of these hoops to deport illegal aliens, criminals from the country, is absolutely mind-boggling. But if you happen to watch the Vice President, Vice Presidential debate, that's not compassionate. That's never been done before. That makes us Nazis, right? Even the lawyers from the left-wing think tank Brennan Center have said that Trump's proposal is lawful. But that hasn't stopped the media from freaking out. They're calling Trump's, uh, climate of fear and saying that mass deportation will bring nothing but human misery. Business Insider tried to make the case that it would make the economy worse, which for Business Insider to say that is weird because I don't write for a business website. And even I know that Jerome Powell just blamed illegal immigration on rising unemployment. So which one is it? Is it good for the economy or is it bad? Are you a good witch or a bad witch? Will mass deportation suddenly cause the entire country to implode into an unholy mess and leave the nation under the control of Nazis and the Hitler Youth? Well, it turns out we've gone down this road before. All we have to do is look, look it up, look. Let's look up some history. And for some odd reason, this has happened before and we're still here. Yeah. And this is still the greatest and most virtuous nation on the planet. So let me take you through a little history and see what everybody's freaking out about. Shall we? Let's start in 1929. From 1929 to 1933, 1.2 million illegals were deported. Really? Back to Mexico. Huh? Then you go to Eisenhower. I can't tell you the name of the operation, but it starts with a W and ends in a K and has a in the middle. Um, 1.1, 1.3 million deported. Now, remember, this is I can't say what that operation was. I can't say it because it's demonized as the worst. Well, of course it's the worst. Herbert Hoover, Republican. Eisenhower, Republican. Oh, until you get to Bill Clinton, who deported 12 million or had voluntary removal, exactly what Donald Trump is saying that the left is saying can't happen. It will destroy everything. It'll be chaos. Cats and dogs will be sleeping together. It will be a nightmare. Except Mr. Democrat himself, the man that brought the party back from extinction, that Bill Clinton, you know, the first black president, 12 million. Huh? So it can be done. Now, under George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009, 2 million were deported. Under Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017, 3 million were deported. Yes, the progressive Jesus himself. Oh, he just didn't love people. But immigration advocates knew him by another name, the Deporter-in-Chief. Now you look at all these numbers. Now, these are, you know, classified as mass deportations. And then I want you to look at Mr. Hitler himself, the Trump administration from 2017 to 2021, 935,000 were deported. Nowhere near either Bill Clinton nor Barack Obama. But now we face a legitimate crisis and everyone's freaking out. How can this be? That can't be done. It'll be crazy. We're a bigger country in 2024 than we were in the '90s under Bill Clinton. And this time it is a crisis. It's not some intangible threat anymore. Americans are seeing the ramification from the some of the largest cities to the smallest Midwestern towns. Let me show you a map. This map was produced, uh, by the Center for Immigration Studies. Now, this thing identifies every city, county, and state in America that has self-identified as official sanctuary city for illegal aliens. Do you live near or by any of these areas? You might want to think about moving in this area. Okay? These are places that refuse to cooperate with the immigration officers. If they see an illegal alien come through their system. Are, are they criminals? It doesn't matter to these elected officials in these areas. And who could these illegals be? Well, let me tell you, last week from ICE, this administration's ICE, they released new information to Congress. They identified 600,000 illegals that were released into our country that have criminal records. That includes 13,000 murderers and 16,000 found from sexual assault like rape. Oh, let's let them in. Thousands and thousands are of criminals are roaming the streets of America. This is exactly what everyone has been making fun and saying, "Donald Trump is a madman" when he said, "They're opening up their prisons." That's exactly what they've done with the help of our government. And the left is coddling them like innocent little to toddlers. American citizens are getting raped. They are murdered by some of these illegal aliens, the known criminals. And Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don't seem to give a flying crap.

Now the vast amount of these illegals coming across are coming from countries now considered hostile to the United States. We, if we could have the 2001, uh, late 2001, maybe October 2001 versions of ourself, they would club us to death for being this stupid these are official numbers directly from the Border Patrol website that show the encounters from hostile nations were around 144,000 the first year after Trump left office it's only gotten worse those numbers are more than doubling to 400 ,000 a year a year later then it doubled again last year we're not even finished with this fiscal year and we're on P Pace to match those numbers from 2023 these are numbers that are people coming from hostile like Iran and Pakistan and Afghanistan now over the last two years over 250 illegals on the terrorist watch list that we know of of were trying to cross the border want to guess how many were released into the country mm 99 why would one of them be released into the country and if that doesn't sound worrisome enough look what else is getting smuggled across the border now I just want to remind you they hate guns guns are dangerous we have to take all the guns away from the citizens I mean you know the spooky guns anything that shoots bullets in this year alone nearly a million rounds of ammunition we have found coming across the border around 9,000 magazines and that's not like you know Boys Life 1.2 million gun parts 3,000 silencers and over 3,000 body armor vests now what do you suppose those good folks that are just coming to make their life better in America America are using body armor and silencers for this is not a problem just for Texas anymore our border communities down in Texas Arizona uh New Mexico California just decimated by this I showed you that map of sanctuary cities these dangerous illegal aliens potentially armed with smuggled weapons and ammunition might be in your community right now there might be really good people that also broke the law and came here but who's who let me show you four illegals were charged with raping or sexually assaulting children in Nantucket we're seeing a lot more and it spreads to small towns in places like Ohio and Colorado why not there are 15,000 rapists or sexual assault people coming into the country let them in of course there's more rape of course there's more child porn child smuggling child abuse how did we get here well this one's your mood's not going to improve you don't have to look further than the Biden Harris Administration Christopher rufo recently followed the money trail that enabled violent Venezuelan gang members to terrorize apartment complexes in Aurora Colorado this is infuriating I want to start at the end I want to start where you picked the story up we picked the story up Venezuelan gangs they began harassing an apartment complex in Aurora Colorado and the story went viral when the footage from a doorbell camera captured the entire thing that that apartment complex was managed by a company called cbz management okay a year before you saw this happen a year before that they were approached by representatives from a non-governmental organization an NGO that was offering a sizable amount of uh money to subsidize the rent for newly arrived migrants okay so Chris rufo traced some of that money okay two of the Nos papao and uh VI is that what it is uh VI Wellness they were assisting with Colorado Asylum Seekers program these are the compassionate people here millions of dollars being funneled through NOS this way they could resettle illegals into communities like the apartments in Aurora Colorado so these NOS among others gave the money set them up and then just let the ticking Time Bomb go off now this isn't because Colorado decided to declare themselves a sanctuary State and give their finger to the federal law no no no the original funds came from much higher see here the money train goes here Colorado's Asylum Seekers program okay that's a State office but where they get the money they got the money $3.8 billion for Colorado alone in 2021 do you remember when uh the uh it's I think it was ARP right the American Rescue plan remember that was to rescue us from uh you know all of the problems that we had from covid because we had to get our businesses back on the feet okay so just for Colorado $3.8 billion went to fund this scheme with people like this that ended up there billions of dollars of your tax money are funding the lawlessness of our country and it was all done by Biden and Harris saying no really you've got to be compassionate we have to help these poor businesses that are out of control and these people who have lost their jobs that money was ear marked for this program this benefits the Rogue States the elected city managers the private NOS the property managers all the while you suffer because they spent 3.8 billion just in Colorado where' they get that money they printed it what does that do well that means there's more money in the system and you pay higher prices for everything God I don't know what's wrong with us what is it going to take the Constitution is hanging by a thread when will you rise up and make sure that everyone you know is voting they're all sucking off the tee of the US federal government which is bleeding you dry this is what Trump inherits when he wins in November but the threat as large as this seems the collapse the system the cloud and Piven oh no that's just the beginning as I said earlier your mood's not going to improve much but you need to know it and we go there [Music] next I don't think there's anything that can stop the blood shooting from your eyes or your head exploding

relief 800 the number four relief relief factor.com all right I want to go back to the idea of asymmetric Warfare I want you to check this article out from the Washington Post the post described Israel's pager attack on Hezbollah as an example of red button capability a red button is something an adversary sets up that quote can remain dormant for months if not years before being activated okay that's an amazing example of the kind of asymmetric Warfare but our enemies our enemies they're a lot less techsavvy at least yet but a red button is exactly what we now have being built within our own borders the apartment complex violence in Aurora Colorado brought out a name that you might have just learned you heard it in States all across the country now Tren de uh Raga Tren de era is that still anyway um it is uh now a real a real problem the gain comes from Venezuela and it is widely known that they used Biden and the Harris border crisis to infiltrate the United States okay so what it's a gang right well their members have been linked to Lake and Riley's murder in Georgia into the New York City that when the police officers were attacked they're also using migrant shelters hiding in plain sight and building a criminal Empire in Texas they are raping and murdering children and in Chicago the Venezuelan Gang has all but declared war on the native street gangs that have been terrorizing Chicago for decades this is a powder keg ready to explode now we know thanks to Elite given to James O'Keefe that the US Army is now concerned about this new threat from Venezuela this map from the leak details the known operating locations the Gang has spread out to uh notice over here especially they're everywhere that's where the bulk of the population lives in America so what's going on okay here's where I'm going to wreck your mood because I know it's happy so far this report from the Insight crime uh States that this gang Works alongside the Venezuelan government something else that Donald Trump said and everyone dismissed this is part of their hybrid governance system they quote enforce the government's will much like a militant civilian group that suppresses political opposition and how far does their relationship with Venezuela's government go well they've actually been accused by the Chilean government of carrying out a political assassination on an opponent of President Maduro but let's go back to that leak from the Army the documents here will show you details multiple attacks on US military facilities they have fired multiple shots at Lackland Air Force Base here in Texas at that same base members of the gang were suspected of taking surveillance photos and videos that same month one day later a member of the gang was caught attempting to gain access to another military base in Texas Fort Sam Houston now I'm sure these are unrelated or they are probing attacks and surveillance but they aren't merely focused on military bases they've also been caught organizing and working in concert with Cuban Nationals at the largest oil field in the United States the peran basin they're checking out and probing our military bases they're identifying our economic hubs they're building their numbers through migrant facilities and they've spread their tentacles all over the United States why is no one in the press and no one in the federal government taking this more seriously finally two weeks ago the Texas governor Greg Abbott designated the terrorist group Tren uh de yeah DEA I'm getting so close I mean can you if it wasn't for the skin color he just uh labeled them a terrorist organization Texas is the only one not messing around and for good reason check this quote out from the US Army leak the links between Iran Hamas and Hezbollah are strengthened by the support of the Venezuelan dictatorship which responds to the influence of Cuba and a superior one from Russia there are growing concerns that these connections are transforming from criminal activities to acts of urban terrorism in other words the Biden Harris group helped our enemies to gain red button capability By ignoring and enabling the Border crisis for 4 years you might say your friends might say you wouldn't say this your friends might say oh that's ridiculous they have no idea the world is currently on fire has anybody noticed that we are having actual discussions at the highest levels of governments all over the world about the use of nuclear weapons we are currently directly or indirectly a participant in two major regional Wars from UK Ukraine and Russia to Israel Hamas Hezbollah and Iran we're going to be involved in these if this isn't stopped do you think that these terrorists are here and they're not going to use moments like the election you really think that these people are here and we're just going to woo them over to our side because look you could have air conditioning and a new car did Biden and Harris give all of these enemies a first strike opportunity through the Border crisis you will find I believe the answer to be yes but only time will tell for 4 years the Border has been all but open to South America and I think you'll be shocked about what they're building down there over the past couple of uh decades I'm sorry I have to say it again what I'm going to show you next is not going to improve your mood much next [Music] okay hey have you heard about the Cyber scammers on the news that tried to steal Gracin from Elvis Presley's family yeah FBI calls this house stealing they stole grac yeah yeah

internet for the media and the Democrats to finally talk about the potential ramification and threats from the border and illegal alien crisis that we're in we're no longer a serious country and that is painfully obvious to the rest of the world we're just uh you know we're just so just sowh caught up here let me give you a little update on who we are currently considering hostile um and who their allies and proxies are so hostile countries Russia and China considered our biggest geopolitical Rivals and we're now engaged with Russia in a kinetic War through our proxy Ukraine Russia is allied with Iran who happens to call us the big Satan the little Satan is Israel who's now waging a war on two of Iran's proxies Hamas and Hezbollah and as I showed you from that US Army leak all of the above seem to have some weird relationship with some countries in South America going to come back to that now how might these enemies take advantage of our border what could they possibly be planning well it was last year that FBI director Christopher Ray warned that the war in the Middle East could open up the attacks for Hamas here in the US but is that even serious well yeah yeah it is and here's a little Hamas in the United States history for the thousands of misguided youths media and academics in 1993 the FBI wir tapped a secret Muslim Brotherhood meeting in Philadelphia that uncovered a plot by their us-based organizations to fund Hamas with millions of dollars to wage war on Israel the entire meeting was how to deceive the American people one high ranking member said and I quote I swear to Allah that war is deception deceive your enemy he then stressed the importance to influence Congress oh and Infiltrate The American Media outl Outlets universities and research centers isn't it weird cuz none of that happened of course but isn't it weird that those are all the American institutions right now that always seem to defend Hamas and demonized Israel and keep in mind the entire purpose of this meeting was to facilitate Jihad through Hamas against Israel with American donation dollars one of the attendees of that secret meeting meeting was a public relations director named niad Awad he was never indicted in fact Awad became the chairperson of care the Council on American Islamic relations that that guy uh he that uh guy started care or became the head of care and authorities believed that that was the under the radar new front organization that had no evident ties hum of to M however let me show you a photo of a wad with both Rashida Talib and Elon Omar infiltration complete I guess if you were to ask any of the FBI agents that wiretapped that secret meeting if you ask any of the federal attorneys that prosecuted this case I think they'd say yeah Hamas is pretty active still very much active in the United States but we don't know we don't know we're not going to be told is anybody even looking into it we don't know how many Hamas cells are currently in the country we don't know how many more are coming across the border but here's what we do know that some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world have been gathering in South America for a long time now they've been doing it in tandem with our enemies I showed you the secret Hamas meeting in Philadelphia well here's another little secret meeting this document is from congressional testimony from 2011 by the committee on homeland security it describes a quote secret Summit that was held in Caracus in Venezuela on August 2010 you see the president uh Hugo Chavez invited and hosted the supreme leader of Hamas and the chief of operations for Hezbollah and the Secretary General of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad what what what what what is this why Obama became the deporter in-chief and became one of the most the biggest Mass second biggest Mass deportation in recent memory but he never called it Mass deportation get ready because this gets worse Iranians right now are on an island off off the coast of Venezuela Margarita Island they are running money laundering operations establishing paramilitary training centers recruiting Venezuelan gangs and sending them to Iran for followon training our government knows all of this they have every single member in this Terror plot mapped out all the way from the head of the Venezuelan government to the middleman to the heads of both Hezbollah and and the Iranian revolutionary guard why would we give Iran money interesting question isn't it they have all of their networks and their cells mapped out to the exact cities where they operate with and without of Venezuela M gang members gang members um the gang members uh Iran is recruiting come from the neighborhood watch communities now they have a different uh understanding of neighborhood watch these are thugs that overtake communities and are loyal to Maduro this is what this gang was doing in Venezuela one intelligence expert in South America stated quote it would not be surprising that Iran and Hezbollah already present in the region for a long time are training advising and financing criminal activities such as those of the Tren deaga now this Gang has used the Border crisis to infiltrate the United States of America this is the gang that has been labeled a terrorist organization in Texas this is the gang that is surveilling and probing military bases they are moving our our largest energy assets uh and they're moving on them they're monitoring them been caught around them they're setting up networks in migrant facilities and apartment complexes at what point do you recognize this was an invasion at what point does anyone with the public ask where are they getting their orders from is it from Venezuela is it from Hezbollah is it from Russia is it from Iran much of this Terror coordination in vene Vela began under Obama uh he went on to mass Deport it like it was nobody's business now why is this such a controversial topic today crisis has never been greater On the Border the threat both the criminal and Terror has never been more imminent the networks and training have been gone been going on now for over a decade and now we have those trained Venezuelan gangs operating with impunity in inside our country this is not an intangible talking political Point anymore I would say we could be but I'm telling you now we are looking at asymetric Warfare with red button capability inside the United States and this Administration has allowed it to happen and in their own special way encouraged it the case for Mass deportation has already been made the only question is is it too late before Donald Trump can begin it in January 20th tomorrow I'm going to be down on the ground of Appalachia I'm going to do the radio show and then I fly out we're delivering a Plane full of stuff and then we're taking hilos into Asheville and then I'll be back uh for the broadcast the next morning all of this stuff is going to be solved by us we the people being good and kind to one another and standing up the Republic is at stake will you stand for her and [Music] vote for
