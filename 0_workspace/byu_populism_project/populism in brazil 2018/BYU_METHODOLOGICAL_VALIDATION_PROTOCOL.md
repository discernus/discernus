# BYU Methodological Validation Protocol: Technical Implementation Specification

## Executive Summary

This document specifies the technical implementation details for validating our Discernus platform against BYU Team Populism research standards. The protocol centers on a **four-condition experimental design** that systematically validates methodological precision advantages across different LLM interaction paradigms.

**Cross-Reference**: Strategic engagement approach and user experience considerations are detailed in `BYU_STRATEGIC_ENGAGEMENT_PLAN.md`

## Current Status & Context

### Corpus Assembly Completed
We have successfully assembled a **high-quality Portuguese corpus** using the same speeches that BYU manually coded for their 2018 Bolsonaro study:

**Transcription Quality**: 
- **12 speeches** covering complete campaign timeline (July-October 2018)
- **ElevenLabs professional transcription** with high accuracy for Brazilian Portuguese
- **Proper timestamps** and **speaker identification** preserved
- **Cultural and political terminology** correctly captured
- **Campaign context elements** noted (crowd reactions, applause, music)

**Timeline Coverage**:
- **Pre-Campaign**: Campaign launch (22 julho)
- **Early Campaign**: Regional rallies (August)  
- **Critical Period**: Pre/post assassination attempt (September)
- **Final Push**: First round through runoff victory (October)

### Initial Chatbot Prototyping Results
Prior to developing this systematic protocol, we conducted **initial exploratory analysis** using conversational AI interfaces to test our `populism_pluralism_v1.0.yaml` framework on this corpus:

**Key Findings**:
- **Populist patterns detected**: Clear "povo vs. elite" rhetoric, anti-establishment positioning
- **Temporal variations observed**: Rhetorical intensity changes across campaign timeline
- **Speaker isolation effects noticed**: Different results when analyzing Bolsonaro's utterances separately from rally context

**Critical Concerns Identified**:
- **Methodological uncertainty**: Chatbot interfaces may reference external training data
- **Reproducibility issues**: Conversational AI results difficult to validate or replicate
- **Academic credibility gap**: Ad-hoc methodology insufficient for academic standards

### Strategic Pivot to Systematic Validation
These initial results suggested **significant potential** but highlighted the need for **methodological rigor**. This led to our current four-condition experimental design that systematically validates:

1. **What we observed informally** (chatbot interface results)
2. **What we can achieve systematically** (controlled AI pipeline)
3. **What ground truth looks like** (manual isolation)
4. **What contextual effects exist** (full rally analysis)

## Critical Open Questions Framework

Our protocol must definitively answer these fundamental questions to validate this strategic direction:

### Technical Viability Questions (Q1-Q6)
- **Q1**: Can our framework detect populist discourse patterns with accuracy comparable to manual human coding?
- **Q2**: Does our approach work effectively for Portuguese political discourse, including specific terminology like 'povo' versus 'elite'?
- **Q3**: Can we generate visualizations that feel "Jupyter native" rather than "wacky bolt-ons" to academic users?
- **Q4**: Is our temporal analysis capability sufficient to track rhetorical changes over campaign timelines?
- **Q5**: Can we achieve reliable transcription quality from video sources for Portuguese political speeches?
- **Q6**: Does our framework handle domain-specific Brazilian political discourse (not just general Portuguese)?

### Market Validation Questions (Q7-Q12)
- **Q7**: Do our analytical outputs provide insights that researchers cannot easily obtain through existing methods?
- **Q8**: Is there genuine demand for computational approaches to supplement manual coding workflows?
- **Q9**: Would graduate students actually adopt Jupyter notebook-based analytical tools?
- **Q10**: Can our approach scale beyond individual researchers to research networks?
- **Q11**: Can we provide baseline validation against speeches already hand-coded by academic teams?
- **Q12**: Can we enable meaningful comparisons across candidates within the same election cycle?

### Business Model Questions (Q13-Q18)
- **Q13**: Can we address "black box" concerns while maintaining competitive advantage?
- **Q14**: What licensing approach builds trust while preserving future revenue potential?
- **Q15**: How do we reassure collaborators we won't "rugpull" them after they invest resources?
- **Q16**: Is there a path from academic partnerships to sustainable monetization?
- **Q17**: Can we differentiate sufficiently from existing text analysis tools?
- **Q18**: Do we provide enough value to justify resource investment from research partners?

### Partnership Viability Questions (Q19-Q23)
- **Q19**: Are we bringing genuine value to academic collaborations, or just asking for favors?
- **Q20**: Can we meet the methodological rigor standards required for academic publication?
- **Q21**: Can we reach the "expensive manual human rater happy place equivalent" quality standard?
- **Q22**: Is there alignment between our development roadmap and research community needs?
- **Q23**: Can we build lasting partnerships rather than one-off collaborations?

### Success Validation Framework
**If we can answer YES to 17+ of these 23 questions after executing our protocol, we have validated this strategic direction.**

**Critical Success Threshold**: Must answer YES to ALL Technical Viability questions (Q1-Q6) and at least 3 of 6 Market Validation questions (Q7-Q12) to proceed.

## Four-Condition Experimental Design

### Strategic Rationale
This addresses the core academic concerns about "black box" AI analysis while providing a novel methodological contribution that human raters cannot easily replicate. The systematic validation of methodological rigor importance in computational social science research.

### Core Research Questions
- **RQ1**: What happens when you trust a chatbot interface to do comparative studies of speaker isolation?
- **RQ2**: What happens when you do cleanly separated comparative studies of speaker isolation via controlled cloud LLM prompting?
- **RQ3**: What happens when you rely on conversational AI vs. systematic computational pipelines?
- **RQ4**: How much does methodological rigor matter for LLM-based discourse analysis validity?

### Four Experimental Conditions

**Condition 1 (Ground Truth)**: Manual extraction of Bolsonaro-only utterances from transcripts
- Extract only Speaker tags identified as Bolsonaro
- Remove crowd reactions, other speakers, musical interludes while preserving timestamps
- Serves as baseline for isolation accuracy validation

**Condition 2 (Baseline)**: Full context analysis with all speakers, crowd reactions, musical elements  
- Complete rally transcripts with all contextual elements
- Provides measurement baseline for contextual effects
- Replicates BYU original methodology approach

**Condition 3 (Controlled AI)**: AI-prompted speaker isolation via systematic pipeline with controlled prompts
- Systematic computational pipeline with documented prompts
- Controlled methodology with statistical reliability testing
- Target methodology for academic standards

**Condition 4 (Chatbot Interface)**: Conversational chatbot analysis (replicating original ad-hoc approach with improved consistency)
- Conversational AI interface for comparative validation
- Documents methodological rigor impact on results quality
- Validates importance of systematic approaches

### Implementation Process

**Phase 1: Manual Isolation (Days 1-2)**
Create clean Bolsonaro-only versions of 5 key speeches:
- Campaign launch (22 julho)
- Regional rally (31 agosto) 
- Pre-attack (6 setembro)
- Post-attack (16 setembro)
- Final rally (27 outubro)

**Phase 2: Four-Condition Analysis (Days 3-4)**
Run identical populism framework across all conditions:
- Statistical comparison of populism scores across all four conditions
- Cross-condition reliability analysis and methodological validation
- Effect size measurement for speaker isolation impact

**Phase 3: Comprehensive Validation Documentation (Day 5)**
Academic-grade methodology comparison:
- Four-condition experimental design documentation
- Statistical validation across all interaction paradigms
- Methodological rigor impact assessment
- Computational social science best practices demonstration

## Strategic Alignment with BYU Methodology

### Critical Gap Resolution
Based on analysis of the BYU paper, we identified three critical alignment challenges that our approach systematically addresses:

**1. Scoring Scale Mismatch → Direct Scale Adoption**
- **Challenge**: BYU uses 0-2 scale, conversion introduces error and complicates comparison
- **Solution**: Implement exact BYU scoring scale (0=non-populist, 1=somewhat populist, 2=extremely populist)
- **Advantage**: Enables direct validation against their 0.5 average score with zero conversion error

**2. Holistic vs. Granular Analysis → Multi-Prompting Strategy**
- **Challenge**: BYU uses "holistic approach" analyzing whole speeches, we risk fragmentary analysis
- **Solution**: Experiment with both holistic prompts (matching BYU) AND granular prompts (novel insights)
- **Advantage**: Demonstrate methodological flexibility while providing insights BYU methodology couldn't capture

**3. Single-Coder Analysis → Inter-AI Reliability Testing**
- **Challenge**: Need to simulate BYU's multiple human coder validation approach
- **Solution**: Comprehensive reliability testing across multiple LLMs + stability testing within models
- **Advantage**: Potentially exceed human inter-rater reliability through systematic computational validation

### Framework Enhancement Requirements

**Technical Requirements**:
- **Multi-Prompting Strategy Experiments**:
  - Holistic discourse analysis prompts (matching BYU's "whole speech" approach)
  - Granular fragment analysis prompts (for detailed insights BYU couldn't capture)
  - Comparative analysis showing methodological flexibility and novel insights
- **Inter-AI Reliability Testing**:
  - Cross-LLM validation (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.) to address "black box" concerns  
  - Multiple runs per model to test stability and consistency
  - Statistical reliability coefficients (Cronbach's alpha, inter-rater reliability)
- **BYU Replication Capabilities**:
  - Target: Reproduce 0.5 average score ±0.1 for direct validation
  - Temporal pattern matching: Replicate 0.5→0.9 progression across campaign timeline
  - Turning point detection: Identify same October 7 intensification BYU found
- **Multi-Dimensional Framework Enhancement**: Add patriotism/nationalism axis to create two-dimensional discourse analysis
  - **Populism ↔ Pluralism** (original axis): Popular will, elite framing, Manichaean vision
  - **Patriotism/Nationalism ↔ Cosmopolitanism** (new axis): State primacy, national distinctiveness, sovereignty emphasis
  - **Competing Discourse Detection**: Quantitatively measure tension BYU identified qualitatively ("patriotism competes with populism")
  - **Theoretical Innovation**: First systematic measurement of discourse competition in political communication
- **Multilingual capability** (Portuguese political terminology)
- **Framework Specification v3.1 compliance**

### Competitive Methodological Advantages

**Multi-Dimensional Theoretical Innovation**: BYU identified that "patriotism and nationalism compete with populism" but could only observe this qualitatively. Our two-dimensional framework (Populism↔Pluralism + Patriotism↔Cosmopolitanism) provides the first systematic quantitative measurement of discourse competition in political communication research.

**Speaker Isolation Innovation**: BYU acknowledged that speeches were given "at different places, on different platforms, and to different audiences" with potential "framing effects" but couldn't control for these contextual variables. Our systematic speaker isolation directly addresses this acknowledged limitation.

**Discourse Competition Measurement**: BYU observed that Bolsonaro's populism score was limited by patriotic elements but couldn't quantify this relationship. Our framework can measure discourse tension coefficients and predict when competing rhetorical strategies limit overall populism scores.

**Reproducibility Excellence**: BYU relied on manual transcription and human coding with inherent subjectivity. Our computational approach with multiple validation layers provides unprecedented reproducibility.

**Scale Potential**: BYU analyzed 10 speeches with multiple human coders (expensive, time-intensive). Our approach can scale to hundreds of speeches while maintaining methodological rigor.
