# BYU Researcher Engagement Strategy: Question-Driven Planning

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a strategic approach to engaging BYU researchers through a question-driven methodology, role-playing as **Sarah Chen**, a PhD student assigned to evaluate Discernus for the Bolsonaro replication project. The strategy emphasizes incremental deliverables that address sequential researcher concerns while building toward a comprehensive Jupyter-based research platform with **four-condition methodological validation** and **multi-dimensional discourse analysis**.

## Strategic Context & Methodological Innovation

### Core Methodological Contribution
Our engagement strategy centers on demonstrating **methodological precision advantage** through systematic experimental validation across different LLM interaction paradigms, directly addressing academic concerns about computational social science rigor.

**Four-Condition Experimental Design:**
- **Condition 1 (Ground Truth)**: Manual extraction of Bolsonaro-only utterances from transcripts
- **Condition 2 (Baseline)**: Full context analysis with all speakers, crowd reactions, musical elements  
- **Condition 3 (Controlled AI)**: AI-prompted speaker isolation via systematic pipeline with controlled prompts
- **Condition 4 (Chatbot Interface)**: Conversational chatbot analysis (replicating original ad-hoc approach with improved consistency)

**Multi-Dimensional Framework Enhancement:**
- **Populism ↔ Pluralism**: Popular will, elite framing, Manichaean vision (original axis)
- **Patriotism/Nationalism ↔ Cosmopolitanism**: State primacy, national distinctiveness, sovereignty emphasis (new axis)
- **Competing Discourse Detection**: Quantitative measurement of tension BYU identified qualitatively ("patriotism competes with populism")

### Golden Path Development Strategy
Before delivering to Sarah Chen, we execute **complete analytical workflow validation** to ensure proven, confident analytical pathways through internal analysis of all four conditions with statistical validation.

## Role-Play Profile: Sarah Chen, BYU PhD Student

**Background:**
- 3rd year Political Science PhD at BYU
- Assigned by Kirk Hawkins to evaluate Discernus platform
- Participated in original Bolsonaro manual coding project
- Skeptical of computational approaches but open to evidence
- Responsible for writing recommendation memo to Professor Hawkins

**Initial Mindset:**
*"Professor Hawkins asked me to look at this Discernus tool, but honestly, I'm skeptical. We spent months manually coding those Bolsonaro speeches. Can a computer really understand populist rhetoric? And how do I know this isn't just another 'black box' that can't be validated?"*

## Phase 1: Methodological Validation & Trust Building (Weeks 1-2)

### Sarah's Primary Concerns
**Core Question:** *"Does this thing actually work, and can I trust the methodology enough to stake my reputation on it?"*

### Sequential Question Framework - Enhanced

**Q1: Methodological Rigor**
- How do you address "black box" concerns about AI analysis?
- Can I replicate your results and understand every step?
- What's your experimental validation approach?
- How do you control for bias and contamination effects?

**Q2: BYU Replication Accuracy**
- Can you reproduce our exact 0.5 average score ±0.1?
- Do you detect the same 0.5→0.9 temporal progression we found?
- Can you identify the October 7 populism intensification turning point?
- How do your results correlate with our manual coding (target: r > 0.80)?

**Q3: Speaker Isolation Innovation**
- What happens when you control for contextual effects?
- How much does rally context vs. pure Bolsonaro rhetoric matter?
- Can you quantify the methodological precision advantage?
- Does this address limitations BYU acknowledged but couldn't control for?

**Q4: Multi-Dimensional Discourse Analysis**
- Can you quantify the populism vs. patriotism competition we observed qualitatively?
- How does the two-dimensional framework enhance analysis?
- What new insights become possible with systematic discourse competition measurement?
- Can you measure discourse tension coefficients?

### Sarah's Phase 1 Evaluation Process - Enhanced

**Week 1: Methodological Assessment**
1. **Experimental Design Review**: "Is this four-condition approach academically defensible?"
2. **BYU Replication Check**: "Do the numbers match what we found manually?"
3. **Statistical Validation**: "Are the correlations significant and systematic?"
4. **Transparency Assessment**: "Can I understand and explain every methodological step?"

**Week 2: Comparative Validation**
1. **Cross-Condition Analysis**: "How much does methodological approach matter?"
2. **Speaker Isolation Impact**: "What's the effect size of contextual control?"
3. **Multi-Dimensional Insights**: "What new analysis becomes possible?"
4. **Academic Defensibility**: "Could I present this methodology at a conference?"

**Sarah's Internal Evaluation:**
*"Wow, this four-condition experimental design directly addresses methodological concerns I didn't even know I had. The speaker isolation effect is statistically significant (p < 0.01), and they're reproducing our temporal patterns with r = 0.84 correlation. The multi-dimensional framework quantifies the populism-patriotism tension we observed but couldn't measure systematically. This isn't just 'AI analysis' - this is methodological innovation."*

### Key Questions Sarah Would Email (Week 2) - Enhanced
1. "Your Condition 3 (Controlled AI) correlates r = 0.84 with our manual coding, but Condition 4 (Chatbot) only r = 0.67. What's causing this methodological rigor effect?"
2. "The speaker isolation results show Bolsonaro-only analysis scores 0.3 points higher than full context. How does this compare to other political leaders?"
3. "Your two-dimensional framework shows populism and patriotism are negatively correlated (r = -0.43) in Bolsonaro's rhetoric. Can you explain the theoretical implications?"
4. "The discourse competition coefficients vary significantly across speeches. Which rhetorical strategies show the strongest tension effects?"

## Phase 2: Practical Integration & Scalability (Weeks 3-4)

### Sarah's Evolving Perspective
**Core Question:** *"This methodology is solid, but can it actually integrate with our research workflow and scale to meaningful projects?"*

- How does this integrate with broader Discernus experiment system?
- Can I configure analysis parameters for different research questions?
- What other theoretical frameworks are available?

**Q7: Cross-National Scalability**
- Could this methodology work for Portuguese, Spanish, English comparative analysis?
- Can we analyze the full Global Populism Database (1000+ speeches)?
- What insights become possible at scale that manual coding can't achieve?
- How do we maintain quality standards across different languages/contexts?

**Q8: Longitudinal Campaign Analysis**
- Can we track rhetorical evolution across multiple election cycles?
- How does temporal pattern detection work for longer timescales?
- Can we identify systematic rhetorical strategy changes?
