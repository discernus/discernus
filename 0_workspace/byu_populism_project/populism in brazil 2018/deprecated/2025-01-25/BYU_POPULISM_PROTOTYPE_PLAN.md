# BYU Populism Prototype: Strategic Plan

## Context & Strategic Rationale

### Role-Play Validation Approach
We conducted an extensive role-play exercise where we simulated Kirk Hawkins (BYU Political Science, Director of Team Populism) receiving a collaboration proposal for the Discernus platform. This approach allowed us to:

- **Validate product-market fit** from an authentic academic researcher perspective
- **Identify specific pain points** in current political discourse analysis workflows
- **Understand quality standards** and methodological requirements
- **Discover collaboration pathways** and potential partnership structures
- **Clarify value propositions** that resonate with academic research needs

### Key Strategic Insights
The role-play revealed that our populism/pluralism framework aligns remarkably well with active academic research. Kirk Hawkins literally runs the [Global Populism Database](https://populism.byu.edu/publications) and has published extensively on measuring populist discourse - meaning this addresses a real, current pain point rather than a theoretical need.

**Strategic Advantages Identified**:
- **Scaling opportunity**: They manually code thousands of speeches - computational assistance could be transformative
- **Methodological innovation**: Geometric visualizations and contradiction detection offer novel analytical capabilities
- **Reproducibility crisis**: Academic demand for transparent, reproducible analysis workflows
- **Global network**: Team Populism spans 30+ countries, providing scale potential
- **Student researcher pipeline**: 15-20 graduate students who could adopt our tools

**Critical Success Factors**:
- Must meet academic quality standards (not just "good enough")
- Requires methodological transparency and reproducibility
- Needs integration with existing workflows (Stata, manual coding)
- Must handle multilingual analysis (Portuguese, Spanish, English)
- Should provide pedagogical value for graduate students

### Strategic Rationale
Rather than building a general-purpose SaaS platform, we're pursuing **strategic academic partnerships** as our go-to-market approach. This allows us to:

1. **Validate methodology** against established academic standards
2. **Build credibility** through peer-reviewed research collaboration
3. **Understand user needs** deeply before scaling
4. **Establish moat** through domain expertise and research relationships
5. **Create network effects** through academic collaboration networks

## Crucial Open Questions

Our plan must definitively answer these fundamental questions to validate this strategic direction:

### Technical Viability Questions
- **Q1**: Can our framework detect populist discourse patterns with accuracy comparable to manual human coding?
- **Q2**: Does our approach work effectively for Portuguese political discourse, including specific terminology like 'povo' versus 'elite'?
- **Q3**: Can we generate visualizations that feel "Jupyter native" rather than "wacky bolt-ons" to academic users?
- **Q4**: Is our temporal analysis capability sufficient to track rhetorical changes over campaign timelines?
- **Q5**: Can we achieve reliable transcription quality from video sources for Portuguese political speeches?
- **Q6**: Does our framework handle domain-specific Brazilian political discourse (not just general Portuguese)?

### Market Validation Questions  
- **Q7**: Do our analytical outputs provide insights that researchers cannot easily obtain through existing methods?
- **Q8**: Is there genuine demand for computational approaches to supplement manual coding workflows?
- **Q9**: Would graduate students actually adopt Jupyter notebook-based analytical tools?
- **Q10**: Can our approach scale beyond individual researchers to research networks?
- **Q11**: Can we provide baseline validation against speeches already hand-coded by academic teams?
- **Q12**: Can we enable meaningful comparisons across candidates within the same election cycle?

### Business Model Questions
- **Q13**: Can we address "black box" concerns while maintaining competitive advantage?
- **Q14**: What licensing approach builds trust while preserving future revenue potential?
- **Q15**: How do we reassure collaborators we won't "rugpull" them after they invest resources?
- **Q16**: Is there a path from academic partnerships to sustainable monetization?
- **Q17**: Can we differentiate sufficiently from existing text analysis tools?
- **Q18**: Do we provide enough value to justify resource investment from research partners?

### Partnership Viability Questions
- **Q19**: Are we bringing genuine value to academic collaborations, or just asking for favors?
- **Q20**: Can we meet the methodological rigor standards required for academic publication?
- **Q21**: Can we reach the "expensive manual human rater happy place equivalent" quality standard?
- **Q22**: Is there alignment between our development roadmap and research community needs?
- **Q23**: Can we build lasting partnerships rather than one-off collaborations?

### Success Validation Framework
**If we can answer YES to 17+ of these 23 questions after executing our plan, we have validated this strategic direction.**

**Critical Success Threshold**: Must answer YES to ALL Technical Viability questions (Q1-Q6) and at least 3 of 6 Market Validation questions (Q7-Q12) to proceed.

**Additional Key Questions** that must be addressed:
- **Q3** (Jupyter native visualizations): Critical for user adoption
- **Q15** (rugpull concerns): Essential for building trust  
- **Q21** (quality standard equivalence): Make-or-break for academic credibility

**Questions Directly Addressed by Speaker Isolation Study**:
- **Q19** (genuine value vs. asking favors): Controlled experimental validation demonstrates clear methodological contribution
- **Q21** (quality standard equivalence): Experimental rigor potentially exceeds manual coding standards through bias reduction
- **Q13** (black box concerns): Complete methodological transparency with ground truth validation

### Jupyter Native Heuristics
To objectively measure the subjective "Jupyter native" feel (Q3), we will evaluate our prototype notebook against the following heuristics. A "native" experience means the user feels empowered and the tool feels like a natural extension of their existing workflow, not a foreign element.

- **1. Data Fluidity**: Can a user easily get data *out* of our visualizations and into a standard Pandas DataFrame with a single, intuitive command? The notebook should not be a data dead-end.
- **2. Standard Library Integration**: Are visualizations built on common, well-documented libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly? Avoids forcing users to learn a bespoke, proprietary visualization API.
- **3. Pedagogical Clarity**: Is the notebook well-documented with Markdown cells that explain the *why* behind the analysis, not just the *what* of the code? Does it guide the user through a narrative?
- **4. Self-Containment & Reproducibility**: Can a user `Run All Cells` from top to bottom without errors? Are dependencies clearly defined and results reproducible?
- **5. Modularity & Hackability**: Are the visualization functions modular enough that a user could reasonably copy a function and tweak it for their own purposes? The notebook should empower, not constrain.

### Pivot Hypotheses & Alternative Value Propositions
A "No-Go" decision on the primary validation path is not a failure, but a data point. Based on the outcome of our pilot, we have the following pre-defined pivots and alternative value propositions:

- **Pivot Hypothesis: From Validation to Exploration.**
  - **Trigger**: If we cannot consistently match the results of manual human coding (fail Q1/Q21).
  - **Pivot**: Re-frame the tool's primary value from *validating existing theories* to *enabling exploratory analysis*. The tool's purpose would be to rapidly scan large corpora to find novel patterns, generate new hypotheses, and identify interesting areas for deep manual review. This changes the user from a "validator" to an "explorer."

- **Alternative Value Prop: The Productivity Multiplier (Human-in-the-Loop).**
  - **Trigger**: Could be a primary offering or a fallback if full automation is too difficult.
  - **Value Prop**: Instead of replacing the human rater, we augment them. The platform would perform a first-pass analysis, flag ambiguous or highly populist/pluralist sections, and present them to a researcher in an efficient UI for final judgment. This shifts the value from "automated results" to "radically faster human coding." This directly addresses the labor-intensive nature of their current workflow.

### Critical Implementation Concerns Identified
Based on our conversation analysis, several specific concerns emerged that require focused attention:

**Jupyter Visualization Integration**: "I personally am not a Jupyter notebook user, so I have some trepidation about it... I just want to make sure our visualization engine ends up feeling 'jupyter native' not some wacky bolt on that gets in the way."

**Licensing/Black Box Concerns**: "If they like the prototype, they are going to immediately ask about licensing and 'black box' concerns before committing real resources."

**Quality Standard Reality Check**: "Whether we feel like we will ever be able to provide him enough quality data that he can get to his expensive manual human rater happy place equivalent... If we can't get to the moon ever, there is no sense building rockets."

**Domain-Specific Language Processing**: Specific concern about Brazilian Portuguese political terminology like 'povo' versus 'elite' and other culturally-specific populist language patterns.

**Academic Validation Requirements**: Need for baseline validation against speeches already hand-coded by academic teams, temporal pattern detection, and cross-candidate comparison capabilities.

## Executive Summary

This document outlines our strategic approach to developing a prototype analysis of Brazilian populist discourse for potential collaboration with Kirk Hawkins and the BYU Team Populism project. The goal is to validate our Discernus platform's capability to provide academic-grade analysis of political discourse while building a foundation for future research partnerships.

## Strategic Objectives

### Primary Goal
Demonstrate that Discernus can provide meaningful, reproducible analysis of populist discourse that meets academic research standards and complements existing manual coding methodologies.

### Secondary Goals
- Validate our populism/pluralism framework against established academic work
- Build trust with academic researchers through transparency and methodological rigor
- Establish a pathway for future research partnerships
- Develop Jupyter notebook-native visualization capabilities

## Background Context

**Research Partner**: Kirk Hawkins, BYU Political Science, Director of Team Populism
- Runs the Global Populism Database (66 countries, 2000-2018)
- Published extensively on measuring populist discourse
- Uses manual coding with graduate student teams
- Published specific analysis of Bolsonaro's 2018 campaign rhetoric

**Value Proposition for Partnership**:
- Scale manual coding work through computational analysis
- Provide novel geometric visualizations of ideological positioning
- Enable reproducible research workflows through Jupyter notebooks
- Detect rhetorical contradictions and temporal patterns

## Current Status & Context

### Corpus Assembly Completed
We have successfully assembled a **high-quality Portuguese corpus** using the same speeches that BYU manually coded for their 2018 Bolsonaro study:

**Transcription Quality**: 
- **12 speeches** covering complete campaign timeline (July-October 2018)
- **ElevenLabs professional transcription** with high accuracy for Brazilian Portuguese
- **Proper timestamps** and **speaker identification** preserved
- **Cultural and political terminology** correctly captured
- **Campaign context elements** noted (crowd reactions, applause, music)

**Timeline Coverage**:
- **Pre-Campaign**: Campaign launch (22 julho)
- **Early Campaign**: Regional rallies (August)  
- **Critical Period**: Pre/post assassination attempt (September)
- **Final Push**: First round through runoff victory (October)

### Initial Chatbot Prototyping Results
Prior to developing this systematic plan, we conducted **initial exploratory analysis** using conversational AI interfaces to test our `populism_pluralism_v1.0.yaml` framework on this corpus:

**Key Findings**:
- **Populist patterns detected**: Clear "povo vs. elite" rhetoric, anti-establishment positioning
- **Temporal variations observed**: Rhetorical intensity changes across campaign timeline
- **Speaker isolation effects noticed**: Different results when analyzing Bolsonaro's utterances separately from rally context

**Critical Concerns Identified**:
- **Methodological uncertainty**: Chatbot interfaces may reference external training data
- **Reproducibility issues**: Conversational AI results difficult to validate or replicate
- **Academic credibility gap**: Ad-hoc methodology insufficient for academic standards

### Strategic Pivot to Systematic Validation
These initial results suggested **significant potential** but highlighted the need for **methodological rigor**. This led to our current four-condition experimental design that systematically validates:

1. **What we observed informally** (chatbot interface results)
2. **What we can achieve systematically** (controlled AI pipeline)
3. **What ground truth looks like** (manual isolation)
4. **What contextual effects exist** (full rally analysis)

**This prototype plan transforms initial promising but unvalidated observations into academically defensible methodology.**

## Strategic Approach: Critical Gap Resolution

### Addressing Core Methodological Challenges

Based on analysis of the BYU paper, we identified three critical alignment challenges that our approach systematically addresses:

**1. Scoring Scale Mismatch → Direct Scale Adoption**
- **Challenge**: BYU uses 0-2 scale, conversion introduces error and complicates comparison
- **Solution**: Implement exact BYU scoring scale (0=non-populist, 1=somewhat populist, 2=extremely populist)
- **Advantage**: Enables direct validation against their 0.5 average score with zero conversion error

**2. Holistic vs. Granular Analysis → Multi-Prompting Strategy**
- **Challenge**: BYU uses "holistic approach" analyzing whole speeches, we risk fragmentary analysis
- **Solution**: Experiment with both holistic prompts (matching BYU) AND granular prompts (novel insights)
- **Advantage**: Demonstrate methodological flexibility while providing insights BYU methodology couldn't capture

**3. Single-Coder Analysis → Inter-AI Reliability Testing**
- **Challenge**: Need to simulate BYU's multiple human coder validation approach
- **Solution**: Comprehensive reliability testing across multiple LLMs + stability testing within models
- **Advantage**: Potentially exceed human inter-rater reliability through systematic computational validation

### Competitive Methodological Advantages

**Multi-Dimensional Theoretical Innovation**: BYU identified that "patriotism and nationalism compete with populism" but could only observe this qualitatively. Our two-dimensional framework (Populism↔Pluralism + Patriotism↔Cosmopolitanism) provides the first systematic quantitative measurement of discourse competition in political communication research.

**Speaker Isolation Innovation**: BYU acknowledged that speeches were given "at different places, on different platforms, and to different audiences" with potential "framing effects" but couldn't control for these contextual variables. Our systematic speaker isolation directly addresses this acknowledged limitation.

**Discourse Competition Measurement**: BYU observed that Bolsonaro's populism score was limited by patriotic elements but couldn't quantify this relationship. Our framework can measure discourse tension coefficients and predict when competing rhetorical strategies limit overall populism scores.

**Reproducibility Excellence**: BYU relied on manual transcription and human coding with inherent subjectivity. Our computational approach with multiple validation layers provides unprecedented reproducibility.

**Scale Potential**: BYU analyzed 10 speeches with multiple human coders (expensive, time-intensive). Our approach can scale to hundreds of speeches while maintaining methodological rigor.

## Strategic Plan

### 1. Quality Bar Analysis (Critical First Step)
**Goal**: Understand if we can ever reach Kirk's "expensive manual human rater happy place"

**Actions**:
- Deep read the Bolsonaro 2018 paper (`populism-in-brazils-2018-general-elections-pdf.pdf`)
- Identify specific metrics they used (populism scores, temporal patterns, etc.)
- Map their manual coding categories to our framework capabilities
- Assess gap between our current capabilities and their quality standards

**Success Criteria**: Clear understanding of whether our approach can achieve academic-grade results

**Risk**: If we can't bridge the quality gap, there's no point building the technical infrastructure

### 2. Corpus Ingestion Workflow
**Goal**: Reliable transcription pipeline for Portuguese political discourse

**Options Analysis**:
- **YouTube extraction**: Leverage existing infrastructure, but quality concerns
- **Eleven Labs API**: Higher quality, but cost and Portuguese capability questions  
- **Manual transcription**: Guaranteed quality, but not scalable
- **Hybrid approach**: YouTube + human verification for quality subset

**Recommended Approach**: 
- Phase 1: Manual transcription of 10-15 key speeches for proof-of-concept
- Phase 2: Build automated pipeline based on results

**Success Criteria**: Clean, accurate transcripts of representative Bolsonaro campaign speeches

### 3. Framework Enhancement 
**Goal**: Upgrade `populism_pluralism_v1.0.yaml` to full experiment specification with BYU methodology alignment

**Strategic Alignment with BYU Methodology**:
- **Exact Scoring Scale Adoption**: Implement BYU's 0-2 scale (0=non-populist, 1=somewhat populist, 2=extremely populist) to enable direct comparison without conversion errors
- **Three-Dimension Framework Mapping**: Direct alignment with BYU's populism dimensions (popular will praise, elite framing, Manichaean vision)
- **Holistic + Granular Analysis**: Multi-prompting strategy to capture both overall discourse patterns AND detailed fragment analysis
- **Academic Rigor Standards**: Inter-AI reliability testing across multiple LLMs with stability analysis

**Technical Requirements**:
- **Multi-Prompting Strategy Experiments**:
  - Holistic discourse analysis prompts (matching BYU's "whole speech" approach)
  - Granular fragment analysis prompts (for detailed insights BYU couldn't capture)
  - Comparative analysis showing methodological flexibility and novel insights
- **Inter-AI Reliability Testing**:
  - Cross-LLM validation (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, etc.) to address "black box" concerns  
  - Multiple runs per model to test stability and consistency
  - Statistical reliability coefficients (Cronbach's alpha, inter-rater reliability)
- **BYU Replication Capabilities**:
  - Target: Reproduce 0.5 average score ±0.1 for direct validation
  - Temporal pattern matching: Replicate 0.5→0.9 progression across campaign timeline
  - Turning point detection: Identify same October 7 intensification BYU found
- **Multi-Dimensional Framework Enhancement**: Add patriotism/nationalism axis to create two-dimensional discourse analysis
  - **Populism ↔ Pluralism** (original axis): Popular will, elite framing, Manichaean vision
  - **Patriotism/Nationalism ↔ Cosmopolitanism** (new axis): State primacy, national distinctiveness, sovereignty emphasis
  - **Competing Discourse Detection**: Quantitatively measure tension BYU identified qualitatively ("patriotism competes with populism")
  - **Theoretical Innovation**: First systematic measurement of discourse competition in political communication
- **Multilingual capability** (Portuguese political terminology)
- **Framework Specification v3.1 compliance**

**Methodological Innovation Opportunities**:
- **Prompt Engineering Research**: Demonstrate how different analytical approaches (holistic vs. granular) reveal different insights
- **Computational Reliability**: Show AI consistency exceeds human inter-rater variability through systematic testing
- **Speaker Isolation Precision**: Control for contextual effects BYU acknowledged but couldn't systematically address

**Success Criteria**: 
- **Direct Replication**: Achieve r > 0.80 correlation with BYU's temporal pattern (0.5→0.9)
- **Scoring Accuracy**: Reproduce 0.5 average score ±0.1 across 10 campaign speeches
- **Methodological Innovation**: Demonstrate novel insights through systematic speaker isolation and multi-model reliability
- **Academic Standards**: Results defensible in peer review with complete methodological transparency

### 4. Methodological Rigor Validation Study
**Goal**: Demonstrate methodological precision advantage through controlled experimental validation across different LLM interaction paradigms

**Strategic Rationale**: This addresses the core academic concerns about "black box" AI analysis while providing a novel methodological contribution that human raters cannot easily replicate. More importantly, it systematically validates the importance of methodological rigor in computational social science research.

**Four-Condition Experimental Design**:
- **Condition 1 (Ground Truth)**: Manual extraction of Bolsonaro-only utterances from transcripts
- **Condition 2 (Baseline)**: Full context analysis with all speakers, crowd reactions, musical elements
- **Condition 3 (Controlled AI)**: AI-prompted speaker isolation via systematic pipeline with controlled prompts
- **Condition 4 (Chatbot Interface)**: Conversational chatbot analysis (replicating original ad-hoc approach with improved consistency)

**Core Research Questions**:
- **RQ1**: What happens when you trust a chatbot interface to do comparative studies of speaker isolation?
- **RQ2**: What happens when you do cleanly separated comparative studies of speaker isolation via controlled cloud LLM prompting?
- **RQ3**: What happens when you rely on conversational AI vs. systematic computational pipelines?
- **RQ4**: How much does methodological rigor matter for LLM-based discourse analysis validity?

**Implementation Process**:
1. **Manual Isolation Phase** (Days 1-2): Create clean Bolsonaro-only versions of 5 key speeches
   - Campaign launch (22 julho), Regional rally (31 agosto), Pre-attack (6 setembro), Post-attack (16 setembro), Final rally (27 outubro)
   - Extract only Speaker tags identified as Bolsonaro
   - Remove crowd reactions, other speakers, musical interludes while preserving timestamps
   
2. **Four-Condition Analysis Phase** (Days 3-4): Run identical populism framework across all conditions
   - **Condition 1**: Analyze manually isolated transcripts
   - **Condition 2**: Analyze full context original transcripts
   - **Condition 3**: Controlled AI pipeline with systematic speaker isolation prompts
   - **Condition 4**: Chatbot conversational analysis (improved version of original approach)
   - Statistical comparison of populism scores across all four conditions
   - Cross-condition reliability analysis and methodological validation

3. **Comprehensive Validation Documentation** (Day 5): Academic-grade methodology comparison
   - Four-condition experimental design documentation
   - Statistical validation across all interaction paradigms
   - Methodological rigor impact assessment
   - Clear demonstration of computational social science best practices

**Success Criteria**:
- **Isolation Effect Detected**: Statistically significant difference between full context vs. isolated analysis
- **Controlled AI Accuracy**: >90% correlation between manual isolation and systematic AI pipeline
- **Methodological Rigor Impact**: Measurable difference between controlled AI vs. chatbot interface results
- **Cross-Condition Validation**: Statistical reliability analysis across all four conditions
- **Academic Defensibility**: Results defensible in computational social science peer review

**Academic Value Proposition**: 
- **Theoretical Innovation**: First quantitative measurement of discourse competition in political communication (populism vs patriotism tension)
- **Methodological Innovation**: Systematic comparison of LLM interaction paradigms + multi-dimensional discourse analysis
- **Computational Social Science Contribution**: Validates importance of methodological rigor in AI-assisted research + advances discourse theory
- **Bias Reduction**: Documents performance context effects and chatbot contamination risks
- **Best Practices Framework**: Establishes standards for LLM-based political discourse analysis
- **Publication Potential**: Major political communication journals + computational methods venues (dual-track academic impact)

**Expected Findings**:
- **Chatbot Interface (Condition 4)** likely shows higher variance and potential contamination from training data
- **Controlled AI (Condition 3)** should closely match manual isolation with improved consistency
- **Full Context (Condition 2)** provides baseline for contextual effect measurement
- **Manual Isolation (Condition 1)** serves as ground truth for all comparisons

**Risk Mitigation**: Even if isolation effects are minimal, the study validates methodological rigor importance - negative results are still academically valuable for establishing computational social science standards

### 5. Jupyter Integration Strategy
**Goal**: Native-feeling visualizations that don't feel "bolted-on"

**Architectural Decision: Researcher-Controlled Analysis**
Rather than providing black-box results, we provide **rigorous experimental setup** with **researcher-controlled analysis execution**. This aligns with academic standards for transparency, reproducibility, and methodological ownership.

**Platform Role**: 
- Generate standardized datasets across all four experimental conditions
- Provide helper function libraries for common analytical tasks
- Create pre-built visualization templates that researchers can modify
- Document complete methodological setup with academic-grade rigor

**Researcher Role**: 
- Execute analysis cells when ready (complete control over timing and parameters)
- Explore data through standard pandas DataFrames with unlimited slicing/dicing capability
- Modify statistical tests, correlation thresholds, and visualization parameters
- Add their own research questions and analytical extensions

**Golden Path Development Strategy**
Before delivering to Sarah Chen, we will **anticipate her analytical workflow** and execute the complete analysis ourselves to ensure a **proven, confident analytical pathway**. This includes:
- Running the full four-condition comparative analysis
- Validating all statistical tests and visualization outputs
- Identifying potential analytical pitfalls and providing guidance
- Creating exemplar analysis notebooks that demonstrate methodological best practices
- Ensuring all helper functions work seamlessly and produce meaningful results

Based on our detailed researcher engagement strategy, Sarah Chen (our representative BYU PhD student evaluator) will need three sequential deliverables that build her confidence from skepticism to partnership recommendation. Each phase addresses her specific evaluation criteria and workflow requirements.

### Phase 4: Evaluation & Decision (Day 8)
1. **Quality assessment** - do our results validate against manual coding AND demonstrate methodological advantage?
2. **Gap analysis** - what would it take to reach academic standards?
3. **Strategic value assessment** - does speaker isolation provide competitive differentiation?
4. **Go/No-Go decision** on pursuing partnership with enhanced value proposition

## Success Criteria & Decision Points

### Go/No-Go Decision Point (End of Phase 3)
**Must Answer These Questions**:
- Can our approach detect the patterns Hawkins found manually?
- Are our visualizations meaningful to political scientists?
- Is the quality gap bridgeable with reasonable effort?
- Do we provide novel insights beyond manual coding?
- **NEW**: Does speaker isolation provide measurable methodological advantage?
- **NEW**: Can we demonstrate academic-grade experimental validation?
- **NEW**: How much does methodological rigor matter for LLM-based analysis validity?
- **NEW**: Can we establish computational social science best practices?

**Go Criteria** (need 5 of 8):
- ✅ Detect major populism trends identified in paper
- ✅ Generate interpretable visualizations
- ✅ Quality gap appears bridgeable
- ✅ Provide novel analytical insights
- ✅ **Speaker isolation shows statistically significant effect**
- ✅ **Experimental validation demonstrates methodological rigor**
- ✅ **Controlled AI pipeline outperforms chatbot interface approach**
- ✅ **Cross-condition reliability analysis supports methodological conclusions**

**No-Go Criteria** (any 1 triggers):
- ❌ Fundamental disconnect between our analysis and manual coding results
- ❌ Quality gap requires complete methodology overhaul
- ❌ Technical complexity exceeds available resources
- ❌ No clear value proposition over existing methods
- ❌ **Speaker isolation validation fails or provides no measurable advantage**

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Portuguese language processing**: Our framework may not handle Brazilian political terminology effectively
- **Quality standards**: Academic standards may be higher than our current capabilities
- **Data availability**: Video transcription quality may be insufficient

### Medium Risk
- **Jupyter integration**: Visualization approach may feel foreign to academic workflows
- **Temporal analysis**: Campaign timeline analysis may require methodological adjustments

### Low Risk
- **Framework adaptation**: Core populism/pluralism concepts should translate
- **Collaboration interest**: Based on role-play, genuine interest exists

## Resource Requirements

### Technical Resources
- Access to Eleven Labs API or similar transcription service
- Development time for framework enhancement
- Jupyter notebook development environment

### Research Resources
- Time for deep analysis of existing academic work
- Manual transcription capacity (10-15 speeches)
- Domain expertise consultation (Portuguese political discourse)

### Success Dependencies
- Quality transcription of source material
- Accurate mapping of academic coding categories to our framework
- Effective visualization of results in academic context

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Begin deep read of Bolsonaro paper to understand methodology and findings
2. **Day 1**: Complete gap analysis between their approach and our capabilities  
3. **Day 2**: Select representative speech sample and begin transcription
4. **Day 3**: Begin framework enhancement for Portuguese analysis
5. **Decision Point**: End of week - Go/No-Go based on pilot results

## Success Metrics
