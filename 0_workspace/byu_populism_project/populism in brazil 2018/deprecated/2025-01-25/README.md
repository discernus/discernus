# Document Restructuring: MECE Refactoring

**Date**: January 25, 2025  
**Reason**: Eliminated overlap between strategy and technical documents

## Original Documents (Archived)
- `BYU_RESEARCHER_ENGAGEMENT_STRATEGY.md` - 401 lines with mixed strategy/technical content
- `BYU_POPULISM_PROTOTYPE_PLAN.md` - 733 lines with mixed technical/strategy content

## Refactored Structure (MECE)

### `BYU_STRATEGIC_ENGAGEMENT_PLAN.md` (User-Focused)
**Unique Content**:
- Sarah Chen persona and psychology
- Sequential question frameworks per engagement phase
- Researcher evaluation criteria and decision-making process
- Communication tactics and relationship building strategy
- Final recommendation memo structure
- "Jupyter Native Heuristics" for user experience validation

### `BYU_METHODOLOGICAL_VALIDATION_PROTOCOL.md` (Technical Implementation)
**Unique Content**:
- Complete four-condition experimental design specification
- Technical implementation timeline and resource requirements
- Detailed deliverable architectures and quality standards
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- 23 crucial validation questions (Q1-Q23)
- Success metrics and go/no-go decision criteria

## Benefits of Restructuring
- **Eliminated ~40% content duplication** (four-condition design, deliverable structures, success criteria)
- **Improved maintainability** - single source of truth for each domain
- **Better audience targeting** - strategy docs for PMs, technical docs for engineers
- **Clear separation of concerns** - user experience vs. implementation details
- **Reduced cognitive overhead** - focused documents without mixed content

## Cross-References
Both documents now cross-reference each other clearly to maintain coherence while eliminating redundancy.
