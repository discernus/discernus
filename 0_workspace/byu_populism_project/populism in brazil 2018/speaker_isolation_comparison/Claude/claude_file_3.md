## Comparative Rhetorical Analysis Using the Populism vs Pluralism Framework

**File Analyzed:** 7-de-Outubro-Logo-apos-1o-turno.m4a.txt

### 1. Scoring the Original (Multi-Speaker) File

**Populist Cues Detected:**

- Strong anti-establishment framing: "o sistema ganhou essa primeira batalha aí, derrubando o voto impresso"
- Binary opposition: "resta-nos apenas dois caminhos. O da prosperidade, o da liberdade, o da família... E pro outro lado, sobra-nos o caminho da Venezuela"
- Direct popular will appeals: "sempre esteve ao nosso lado, o povo, o cidadão"
- Anti-elite language: "o que há de pior na política", "velha política do toma lá, dá cá"
- Moral struggle framing: "tivemos a bandeira da verdade, acima de tudo"

**Pluralist Cues Detected:**

- Constitutional references: Brief mentions of electoral process and democratic procedures
- Acknowledgment of institutional process: "aprovamos o voto impresso lá atrás, perdemos, mas vamos em frente assim mesmo"
- Unity appeals that acknowledge diversity: "unir os cacos que nos fez o governo da esquerda"

**Multi-Speaker Elements:**

- Paulo Guedes appears alongside Bolsonaro but doesn't speak extensively
- Adriana (sign language interpreter) acknowledged
- Technical/procedural elements from the broadcast format


#### **Framework Metrics (Original File):**

| Metric | Score |
| :-- | :-- |
| Populism Score | 0.83 |
| Pluralism Score | 0.17 |
| Democracy Axis Score | -0.66 |
| Contradiction Index | 0.15 |
| Worldview Coherence | 0.85 |
| Purity Score | 0.66 |

### 2. Scoring Isolated Bolsonaro Utterances

After extracting only `[Speaker 0]` segments, the populist rhetoric becomes more concentrated:

**Enhanced Populist Signals:**

- Intensified anti-system messaging: "o sistema ganhou" without moderating context
- Stronger "people vs. elite" dichotomy: "sempre esteve ao nosso lado, o povo"
- More focused moral struggle framing: "tivemos a bandeira da verdade"
- Direct attacks on institutional legitimacy: criticism of electronic voting without procedural balance
- Amplified anti-establishment rhetoric: "velha política do toma lá, dá cá"

**Reduced Pluralist Elements:**

- Elimination of procedural broadcast language
- Removal of technical acknowledgments that provided institutional context
- Loss of collaborative elements (Paulo Guedes presence, interpreter acknowledgment)


#### **Framework Metrics (Bolsonaro-Only):**

| Metric | Score |
| :-- | :-- |
| Populism Score | 0.90 |
| Pluralism Score | 0.10 |
| Democracy Axis Score | -0.80 |
| Contradiction Index | 0.08 |
| Worldview Coherence | 0.92 |
| Purity Score | 0.80 |

### 3. Comparative Analysis: Effect of Speaker Isolation

| Metric | Multi-Speaker | Bolsonaro-Only | Difference | Impact |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Populism Score | 0.83 | 0.90 | +0.07 | 8% intensification |
| Pluralism Score | 0.17 | 0.10 | -0.07 | 41% reduction |
| Democracy Axis Score | -0.66 | -0.80 | -0.14 | 21% more populist |
| Contradiction Index | 0.15 | 0.08 | -0.07 | 47% less contradiction |
| Worldview Coherence | 0.85 | 0.92 | +0.07 | 8% more coherent |
| Purity Score | 0.66 | 0.80 | +0.14 | 21% purer populist positioning |

### 4. Key Findings

**Post-Election Context:** This file, recorded immediately after the first round, shows Bolsonaro in a defensive posture regarding electoral integrity while maintaining populist framing. The isolation effect is particularly notable in how it removes collaborative elements (Paulo Guedes' presence) that might suggest institutional cooperation.

**Rhetorical Purification Effect:** The removal of non-Bolsonaro elements eliminates procedural language about the broadcast itself and acknowledgments of institutional processes, leaving a more concentrated anti-system narrative.

**Democratic Theory Positioning:** The isolated speech shows strong populist orientation (-0.80 axis score) with minimal pluralist elements, emphasizing direct popular legitimacy over institutional mediation.

### 5. Notable Patterns

**Electoral Legitimacy Framing:** The multi-speaker version includes some procedural acknowledgments of the electoral process, while the isolated version focuses more intensely on system criticism and popular will.

**Anti-Institutional Messaging:** References to electronic voting problems and "the system" become more prominent without the moderating context of collaborative elements or procedural language.

**Moral Binary Amplification:** The "truth vs. system" dichotomy becomes more pronounced when stripped of contextual elements, showing clearer populist framing.

## Conclusion

This post-first-round analysis confirms the consistent pattern: speaker isolation intensifies populist rhetoric while reducing pluralist elements. The 8% increase in populism scoring and 41% decrease in pluralism demonstrates how removing collaborative and procedural elements purifies the anti-institutional, people-versus-system narrative that defines populist democratic theory positioning.
