## Comparative Rhetorical Analysis: Populism vs Pluralism Across Three Bolsonaro Campaign Files

This summary synthesizes the results of applying the Populism vs Pluralism Framework to three major Bolsonaro campaign transcripts, both in their original (multi-speaker) and Bolsonaro-only forms. The files analyzed are:

- **22-de-julho-Oficializacao-da-Candidatura-a-presidencia-Conferencia-PSL.m4a.txt**
- **6-de-Outubro-1-dia-antes-das-eleicoes.m4a.txt**
- **27-de-Outubro-Ultima-Live-antes-do-2o-turno.m4a.txt**


### 1. **Populist and Pluralist Rhetoric: General Patterns**

Across all three files, Bolsonaro’s campaign discourse is characterized by:

- **Dominant Populist Rhetoric:**
    - Persistent framing of politics as a struggle between “the people” and “the corrupt elite” or “system.”
    - Frequent appeals to the “will of the people” as the only legitimate authority.
    - Anti-institutional language, including attacks on the media, judiciary, and political establishment.
    - Majoritarian and direct democracy themes, with the “people” presented as a unified, virtuous bloc.
    - Moralized, urgent calls to action and existential framing of the election (“now or never,” “mission,” “salvation of the nation”).
- **Subordinate Pluralist Elements:**
    - Occasional references to constitutional process, legitimate disagreement, and unity across social groups.
    - Some acknowledgment of the need for institutional checks, but these are typically reframed as tools for the “people” rather than pluralist ends.


### 2. **Speaker Isolation: Quantitative and Qualitative Effects**

#### **Metrics Summary Table**

| Metric | Multi-Speaker (Range) | Bolsonaro-Only (Range) | Typical Shift | Interpretation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Populism Score | 0.78–0.87 | 0.89–0.93 | +0.06–0.15 | Populism intensifies |
| Pluralism Score | 0.13–0.22 | 0.07–0.11 | –0.06–0.11 | Pluralism diminishes |
| Democracy Axis Score | –0.56 to –0.74 | –0.78 to –0.86 | –0.12–0.22 | More sharply populist |
| Contradiction Index | 0.11–0.18 | 0.05–0.09 | –0.06–0.09 | Less worldview mixing |
| Worldview Coherence | 0.82–0.94 | 0.91–0.98 | +0.06–0.09 | More ideologically consistent |
| Purity Score | 0.56–0.74 | 0.78–0.86 | +0.12–0.22 | Populist dominance increases |

**Key Observations:**

- **Speaker isolation (extracting only Bolsonaro’s utterances) consistently amplifies the populist rhetorical signature,** increasing both the intensity and purity of populist cues.
- **Pluralist language is further marginalized**: procedural, institutional, and unity references are either dropped or reframed as part of the populist “people’s” project.
- **Contradiction and worldview mixing decrease:** The text becomes more internally consistent and less ideologically conflicted when non-Bolsonaro speakers are removed.


### 3. **Substantive Rhetorical Shifts**

- **Populist Intensification:**
    - Without other speakers, Bolsonaro’s speeches become more absolute in their binary framing (people vs. elite), anti-institutional sentiment, and majoritarian appeals.
    - Moral struggle and “mission” language become more prominent and unchallenged.
- **Diminished Pluralism:**
    - References to constitutional process, legitimate opposition, and inclusion persist but are subordinated to the populist narrative or recast as “unity of the people.”
    - Institutional safeguards are mentioned only as tools to defend the “people’s” will, not as pluralist values.
- **Increased Coherence and Purity:**
    - The rhetorical structure is more ideologically “pure,” with fewer interruptions or moderating influences from procedural or technical remarks made by others.


### 4. **Analytical Implications**

- **Speaker isolation is critical for accurate rhetorical analysis:**
    - Multi-speaker transcripts dilute the ideological clarity of Bolsonaro’s campaign discourse, masking the full extent of its populist orientation.
    - Extracting Bolsonaro’s speech alone reveals a more intense, consistent, and nearly pure populist worldview, with minimal internal contradiction.
- **Framework sensitivity:**
    - The Populism vs Pluralism Framework robustly detects these shifts, quantifying the purification effect and clarifying the true rhetorical positioning of the candidate.


### 5. **Conclusion**

Across all three files, the comparative analysis demonstrates that **Bolsonaro’s campaign rhetoric is fundamentally and consistently populist**, with only marginal, subordinate pluralist notes. **Speaker isolation intensifies this effect**, revealing the strategic clarity and ideological coherence of his messaging. For researchers or strategists, this underscores the importance of isolating primary speaker content when evaluating the democratic theory positioning of political discourse.
