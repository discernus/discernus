## Interpretive Themes

- **Consistent Populism**: All six analyses reveal high alignment with populist rhetoric, worldview coherence, and rejection of institutional pluralism.
- **Legalism as Strategy**: Institutional references serve populist purposes, not democratic proceduralism.
- **Solo Speeches Intensify Purity**: Removing non-Bolsonaro segments amplifies ideological clarity.

## Conclusion
Bolsonaro’s 2018 campaign discourse presents a unified populist narrative framed as a moral battle between good people and corrupt institutions, with consistent rhetorical architecture and minimal contradiction.
