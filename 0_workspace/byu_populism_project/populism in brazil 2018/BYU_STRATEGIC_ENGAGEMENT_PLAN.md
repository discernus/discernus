# BYU Strategic Engagement Plan: Question-Driven Academic Partnership

## Executive Summary

This document outlines our strategic approach to engaging BYU researchers through a question-driven methodology, role-playing as **Sarah Chen**, a PhD student assigned to evaluate Discernus for the Bolsonaro replication project. The strategy emphasizes incremental deliverables that address sequential researcher concerns while building toward a strategic academic partnership.

**Cross-Reference**: Technical implementation details are specified in `BYU_METHODOLOGICAL_VALIDATION_PROTOCOL.md`

## Strategic Context & Academic Value Proposition

### Gate-Driven Engagement Strategy
**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: Internal validation gates drive external partnership engagement. No BYU commitments without proven capability.

**Five Validation Gates**:
1. **Gate 1**: Are LLMs + DCS good enough to replicate Tamaki and Fuks 2018? Like at all.
2. **Gate 2**: Can LLMs + DCS extend and improve on Tamaki and Fuks 2018? Like at all.
3. **Gate 3**: Can we make DCS results analysis feel natural in Jupyter? Like clunky front but smooth back.
4. **Gate 4**: Can we make DCS development feel natural in Jupyter? Like end to end.
5. **Gate 5**: Do we have a package that's good enough to wow BYU? Like knock their socks off.

**Engagement Rules**:
- BYU Phase 1 engagement requires Gates 1-2 validation
- BYU Phase 2 engagement requires Gates 3-4 validation  
- Strategic partnership commitment requires Gate 5 validation
- **Honest limitation documentation** if any gate fails

### Core Methodological Contribution
Our engagement strategy centers on demonstrating **methodological precision advantage** through systematic experimental validation across different LLM interaction paradigms, directly addressing academic concerns about computational social science rigor.

**Multi-Dimensional Framework Enhancement**:
- **Populism ↔ Pluralism**: Popular will, elite framing, Manichaean vision (original axis)
- **Patriotism/Nationalism ↔ Cosmopolitanism**: State primacy, national distinctiveness, sovereignty emphasis (new axis)
- **Competing Discourse Detection**: Quantitative measurement of tension BYU identified qualitatively ("patriotism competes with populism")

### Academic Partnership Rationale
Rather than building a general-purpose SaaS platform, we're pursuing **strategic academic partnerships** as our go-to-market approach. This allows us to:

1. **Validate methodology** against established academic standards
2. **Build credibility** through peer-reviewed research collaboration
3. **Understand user needs** deeply before scaling
4. **Establish moat** through domain expertise and research relationships
5. **Create network effects** through academic collaboration networks

## Role-Play Profile: Sarah Chen, BYU PhD Student

**Background:**
- 3rd year Political Science PhD at BYU
- Assigned by Kirk Hawkins to evaluate Discernus platform
- Participated in original Bolsonaro manual coding project
- Skeptical of computational approaches but open to evidence
- Responsible for writing recommendation memo to Professor Hawkins

**Initial Mindset:**
*"Professor Hawkins asked me to look at this Discernus tool, but honestly, I'm skeptical. We spent months manually coding those Bolsonaro speeches. Can a computer really understand populist rhetoric? And how do I know this isn't just another 'black box' that can't be validated?"*

**Psychological Profile:**
- **Academic Rigor Focus**: Values methodological transparency above convenience
- **Reputation Risk Averse**: Won't recommend tools that could damage her academic credibility
- **Evidence-Driven**: Skeptical but willing to be convinced by strong data
- **Workflow Integration Priorities**: Needs seamless integration with existing research processes
- **Peer Validation Dependent**: Considers how other graduate students and faculty will perceive recommendations

## Phase 1: Foundation Validation & Trust Building (Weeks 1-2)
**Prerequisite**: Gates 1-2 must validate successfully before engaging with BYU

### Internal Validation First (Week 1)
**Critical Questions**: 
- Gate 1: Are LLMs + DCS good enough to replicate Tamaki and Fuks 2018? Like at all.
- Gate 2: Can LLMs + DCS extend and improve on Tamaki and Fuks 2018? Like at all.

**NO BYU engagement until these validate internally**

### Sarah's Primary Concerns (Week 2 - Conditional)
**Core Question:** *"Does this thing actually work, and can I trust the methodology enough to stake my reputation on it?"*

### Sequential Question Framework

**Q1: Methodological Rigor**
- How do you address "black box" concerns about AI analysis?
- Can I replicate your results and understand every step?
- What's your experimental validation approach?
- How do you control for bias and contamination effects?

**Q2: BYU Replication Accuracy**
- Can you reproduce our exact 0.5 average score ±0.1?
- Do you detect the same 0.5→0.9 temporal progression we found?
- Can you identify the October 7 populism intensification turning point?
- How do your results correlate with our manual coding (target: r > 0.80)?

**Q3: Speaker Isolation Innovation**
- What happens when you control for contextual effects?
- How much does rally context vs. pure Bolsonaro rhetoric matter?
- Can you quantify the methodological precision advantage?
- Does this address limitations BYU acknowledged but couldn't control for?

**Q4: Multi-Dimensional Discourse Analysis**
- Can you quantify the populism vs. patriotism competition we observed qualitatively?
- How does the two-dimensional framework enhance analysis?
- What new insights become possible with systematic discourse competition measurement?
- Can you measure discourse tension coefficients?

### Sarah's Phase 1 Evaluation Process

**Week 1: Methodological Assessment**
1. **Experimental Design Review**: "Is this four-condition approach academically defensible?"
2. **BYU Replication Check**: "Do the numbers match what we found manually?"
3. **Statistical Validation**: "Are the correlations significant and systematic?"
4. **Transparency Assessment**: "Can I understand and explain every methodological step?"

**Week 2: Comparative Validation**
1. **Cross-Condition Analysis**: "How much does methodological approach matter?"
2. **Speaker Isolation Impact**: "What's the effect size of contextual control?"
3. **Multi-Dimensional Insights**: "What new analysis becomes possible?"
4. **Academic Defensibility**: "Could I present this methodology at a conference?"

**Sarah's Internal Evaluation:**
*"Wow, this four-condition experimental design directly addresses methodological concerns I didn't even know I had. The speaker isolation effect is statistically significant (p < 0.01), and they're reproducing our temporal patterns with r = 0.84 correlation. The multi-dimensional framework quantifies the populism-patriotism tension we observed but couldn't measure systematically. This isn't just 'AI analysis' - this is methodological innovation."*

### Key Questions Sarah Would Email (Week 2)
1. "Your Condition 3 (Controlled AI) correlates r = 0.84 with our manual coding, but Condition 4 (Chatbot) only r = 0.67. What's causing this methodological rigor effect?"
2. "The speaker isolation results show Bolsonaro-only analysis scores 0.3 points higher than full context. How does this compare to other political leaders?"
3. "Your two-dimensional framework shows populism and patriotism are negatively correlated (r = -0.43) in Bolsonaro's rhetoric. Can you explain the theoretical implications?"
4. "The discourse competition coefficients vary significantly across speeches. Which rhetorical strategies show the strongest tension effects?"

## Phase 2: Integration Validation & Scalability (Weeks 3-4)
**Prerequisite**: Gates 3-4 must validate successfully before strategic partnership commitment

### Internal Validation Continues (Week 3)
**Critical Questions**:
- Gate 3: Can we make DCS results analysis feel natural in Jupyter? Like clunky front but smooth back.
- Gate 4: Can we make DCS development feel natural in Jupyter? Like end to end.

### Sarah's Evolving Perspective (Week 4 - Conditional)
**Core Question:** *"This methodology is solid, but can it actually integrate with our research workflow and scale to meaningful projects?"*

**Q7: Cross-National Scalability**
- Could this methodology work for Portuguese, Spanish, English comparative analysis?
- Can we analyze the full Global Populism Database (1000+ speeches)?
- What insights become possible at scale that manual coding can't achieve?
- How do we maintain quality standards across different languages/contexts?

**Q8: Longitudinal Campaign Analysis**

## Jupyter Native Integration Heuristics

To objectively measure the subjective "Jupyter native" feel, we evaluate our prototype notebook against these heuristics. A "native" experience means the user feels empowered and the tool feels like a natural extension of their existing workflow.

### The Five Heuristics

**1. Data Fluidity**: Can a user easily get data *out* of our visualizations and into a standard Pandas DataFrame with a single, intuitive command? The notebook should not be a data dead-end.

**2. Standard Library Integration**: Are visualizations built on common, well-documented libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly? Avoids forcing users to learn a bespoke, proprietary visualization API.

**3. Pedagogical Clarity**: Is the notebook well-documented with Markdown cells that explain the *why* behind the analysis, not just the *what* of the code? Does it guide the user through a narrative?

**4. Self-Containment & Reproducibility**: Can a user `Run All Cells` from top to bottom without errors? Are dependencies clearly defined and results reproducible?

**5. Modularity & Hackability**: Are the visualization functions modular enough that a user could reasonably copy a function and tweak it for their own purposes? The notebook should empower, not constrain.

### Validation Framework
**Success Threshold**: Must meet 4 of 5 heuristics to be considered "Jupyter native"
**Critical Heuristic**: #1 (Data Fluidity) is mandatory - failure here invalidates the entire approach
