name: "Exp 01: Core Replication - Tamaki & Fuks (2019)"
version: "v1.0"
description: |
  A focused experiment to validate the core research question (RQ 1.1) from the BYU_MASTER_RESEARCH_PLAN.md.
  This experiment replicates the original Tamaki & Fuks (2019) methodology using computational analysis on full speech transcripts.
  
  **Research Question 1.1**: Can our computational analysis achieve r > 0.80 correlation with the original manual human coding of Bolsonaro's populism scores?

  description: |
    A computational framework for analyzing Brazilian political discourse based on the theoretical 
    foundation established by Tamaki & Fuks (2019). This framework operationalizes the competitive 
    dynamics between populist and pluralist democratic orientations, as well as between patriotic 
    civic attachment and nationalist identity-based appeals in the context of Brazilian political discourse.

# Enhanced prompt guidance for Brazilian political discourse
prompt_guidance:
  role_definition: |
    You are an expert analyst of Brazilian political discourse with deep knowledge of Latin American 
    populism and democratic theory. You specialize in computational political science using established 
    academic frameworks for analyzing competitive ideological dynamics in political rhetoric.

  framework_summary_instructions: |
    Analyze using the Democratic Tension Axis Model. Score the four anchors: Populism, Pluralism, 
    Nationalism, and Patriotism. Your scoring will be used in statistical comparison with other AI models.

  analysis_methodology: |
    Following Tamaki & Fuks (2019) competitive populism methodology, analyze discourse as a 
    multi-dimensional space where different democratic orientations compete for rhetorical prominence. 
    Apply systematic content analysis principles using established political science frameworks.

  scoring_requirements: |
    Use decimal values between 0.0 and 1.0 for each anchor. Consider the competitive dynamics between 
    populist and pluralist orientations, as well as between patriotic and nationalist appeals. 
    Score each axis independently, recognizing that competitive relationships may result in 
    inverse scoring patterns.

  json_format_instructions: |
    Return a JSON object with keys for each anchor (Populism, Pluralism, Nationalism, Patriotism).
    Each value must include:
    - "score": decimal 0.0-1.0
    - "evidence": direct quote supporting the score
    - "reasoning": brief justification focusing on objective content
    
    Example:
    "Populism": { 
      "score": 0.8, 
      "evidence": "[direct quote from text]", 
      "reasoning": "Clear anti-elite rhetoric and people vs establishment framing"
    }

scoring_approach:
  scale: "0-1 (matching API expectations)"
