A little while ago, I had the honor of calling Senator Barack Obama to congratulate him - please - to congratulate him on being elected the next president of the country that we both love.\n\nIn a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.\n\nThis is an historic election, and I recognize the special significance it has for African-Americans and for the special pride that must be theirs tonight.

We launched an infrastructure initiative all across the state, taking a balanced, all-inclusive approach to infrastructure investment. I'm proud that we made Maryland into both a national and an international leader, in using innovative solutions to address pressing infrastructure concerns. We moved forward on nearly all of our state's highest priority transportation projects in every single jurisdiction.\n\nAll across our state we made record investments in roads, bridges, tunnels, transit systems, ports and airports.

Many times we found that having partners who knew how to navigate state local government entities were some of the most valuable allies in trying to get large infrastructure projects approved.\n\nSo we incorporated state and local advisors into the working group that could anticipate concerns raised by hyper local interests, that could easily derail or delay projects.

We have arrived at different judgments, but I hope we respect each other's good faith.\n\nThe allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious. As a senator-juror, I swore an oath before God to exercise impartial justice. I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who I am. I take an oath before God as enormously consequential.

In addition, the president's team presented three defenses: first, that there could be no impeachment without a statutory crime; second, the Bidens' conduct justified the president's actions; and third, that the judgment of the president's actions should be left to the voters.\n\nLet me first address those three defenses. The historic meaning of the words \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the writings of the founders, and my own reasoned judgment convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes, they would demand removal from office.

While ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime, it is surely very wrong.\n\nWith regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory but also not a crime. Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit.

This is truly a national loss.\n\nNineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground. But we've never lost an astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle.

It is therefore vitally important we make sure that all children who come into contact with the criminal justice system are treated fairly and appropriately, are not forgotten, and are afforded an opportunity to rehabilitate and become productive, contributing members of society.\n\nOur agreement on this issue was on display late last year at a juvenile justice summit, where we shared the stage for a discussion on a key challenge facing our country: a criminal justice system that over-emphasizes incarceration and is woefully inadequate when it comes to rehabilitation, even for our nation's youth.\n\nMen and women in law enforcement work hard to", "framework_data": {}}

That is being smart on crime, not soft on crime.\n\nDespite political disagreements in Congress on a broader criminal justice reform package — disagreements we hope to move past next year — Democrats and Republicans surely can agree that children shouldn't be locked in a solitary confinement cell for 23 hours a day, or housed with other prisoners twice their age and size, or unnecessarily restrained and shackled for minor infractions, or harshly punished for low-level, nonviolent offenses.\n\nSurely we can agree that juveniles' interactions with the", "framework_data": {}}

Rather, it helps all parties heal and move forward, and it keeps all of us safer by breaking cycles of recidivism.\n\nWe both recognize that this system is in desperate need of reform.

We also share a belief that our home states offer a road map forward.\n\nIn North Carolina, several reforms have been made in recent years, including allowing a juvenile's criminal record to be expunged of non-violent offenses, limiting detention for certain offenses, and requiring a parent, guardian, or attorney to be present during police interrogations of any", "framework_data": {}}

I want to talk to you, um, about in a roundabout way, the things that were talked about last night, except we didn't really talk about them. And as you will see by the end of this hour, we really need to talk about what is happening in our country. One of the most controversial policy proposals apparently that Donald Trump has talked about this election is something that shouldn't be controversial at all, but the left and the mainstream media are absolutely freaking out. If you know history, they should not be. The proposal is mass deportation. And after you see what I'm about to show you, you make the call. I, I truly believe this may be our last chance.

This topic is very, very serious. The case for mass deportation is not racist, nor is it heartless. It is honestly, as J.D. Vance said in the debate, common sense. And we don't have much time left before the unthinkable happens. As I'll show you later in the show, you do not want to miss any of this episode.\n\nNow this is not an abstract issue anymore. Uh, it never was for border communities, but now it is a national threat that the entire country is now experiencing. And catastrophe is coming.

Saddam's Republican guards threw their uniforms off and fought disguised as civilians. In Bin Laden's Al-Qaeda cells, they split all around the entire world, blended into the population, and waited for the order to activate. These are examples of kinetic asymmetric warfare. And later on in the program, I'll show you how our enemies are using immigration and our open borders to attack us. It is coming and the threat has never been more close.

We, the people, the marginalized, the forgotten, and the oppressed, can no longer afford to play by their rules. This is not a misunderstanding; it is a fundamental conflict of interest, a battle for the very soul of this nation.\n\nOur movement is a righteous one, born from the shared experience of injustice. We are the ones who have borne the brunt of a system designed to exploit and exclude. We are the voices of the communities that have been systematically dismantled by corporate greed and political indifference. Our solidarity is our strength, our shared identity is our shield.

I wasn't raised to see my race as significant to anything you could know about me. So what if I'm white? Well, I'm really clear today, after a good 20 years of day in and day out talking to people about race, really clear: I'm white. I have a white frame of reference. I have a white worldview.

I do think people of color know about white fragility way more than I ever will, but again, I do have an insider's perspective.

I have racist patterns that have developed as a result of that. And I also have investments in the system of racism. It's quite comfortable. And it has helped me overcome the barriers that I have faced. For example, in my early childhood, I did go to diverse schools because I grew up in poverty.

White supremacy. Whiteness are all of the unnamed elements that together reproduce and protect white supremacy. White privilege is one of the outcomes of white supremacy.

So we kind of tend to think about a, some natural thing that just emerges, and so they all have to be attended to and protected. Emotions are political for a couple of reasons: One, the framework you're perceiving and interpreting through is what drives the particular emotions that you have, and it is a socio-political framework.

So these, these emotions function in particular ways. Again, they're not denying benign, and they're not neutral. And this leads to what I call white fragility, the inability to tolerate the racial stress of a challenge to our positions or perspectives, our assumptions, and it functions to block the challenge and regain our equilibrium or our positions, right?
