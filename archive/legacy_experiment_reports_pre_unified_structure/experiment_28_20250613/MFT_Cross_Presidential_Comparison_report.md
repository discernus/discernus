## Executive Summary


## Experiment Analysis Summary

This experiment tested the hypothesis: "Different presidential addresses will show distinct MFT foundation patterns reflecting historical context and political positioning"

### Key Results:
- **Success Rate**: 3/3 runs completed successfully
- **Framework Performance**: Average fit score of 0.800 indicates good framework alignment
- **Efficiency**: Average execution time of 15.46 seconds per analysis
- **Cost**: Total analysis cost of $0.1647

### Well Score Patterns:
The highest-scoring wells were Compassion, 
while the lowest-scoring wells were .

### Research Implications:
The results provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the mft_persuasive_force framework in analyzing narrative themes. 
The high framework fit scores suggest this approach is suitable for this type of analysis.
