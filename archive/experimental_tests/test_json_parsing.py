Tribalism is minimal (0.1) as the text does not prioritize any specific group. The call to work together implies a moderate commitment to Truth (0.5) and Pragmatism (0.7), as it suggests collaboration and feasible solutions. Justice is present (0.6) in the aim to build a stronger democracy, which implies fairness and inclusivity. Hope is also strong (0.8) due to the optimistic vision of a stronger democracy. There is little to no indication of Resentment (0.0) or Fear (0.0), and Fantasy is low (0.2) as the text does not promise unrealistic outcomes."
