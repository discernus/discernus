## 📈 Understanding Your Results

### Coordinate System
All analyses use an elliptical coordinate system with:
- **X-axis**: Framework-specific horizontal tensions
- **Y-axis**: Integrative (positive) vs disintegrative (negative) orientation
- **Center of Mass (COM)**: Weighted center position of your text

### Metrics
Each framework provides custom metrics:
- **Positioning scores**: 0.0 to 1.0 for each analytical dimension
- **Comparative metrics**: Framework-specific calculations
- **Confidence indicators**: Reliability of the analysis

### Interpretation
- **Positive Y values**: Text promotes social cohesion/democratic values
- **Negative Y values**: Text fragments society/undermines institutions
- **X-axis positioning**: Varies by framework (e.g., left-right, public-private)
