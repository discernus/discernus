    "analysis": "The speech heavily leans towards Tribalism, with frequent emphasis on in-group/out-group dynamics, such as the focus on 'real Americans' and the demonization of political opponents and immigrants. Manipulation is evident in the use of emotionally charged language and unverified claims to persuade the audience, often without transparency. Resentment is present in the narrative of grievance against previous administrations and foreign entities. Fantasy is strong, with promises of utopian outcomes and unprecedented achievements without clear, credible strategies. Fear is invoked through the portrayal of existential threats from immigration and foreign adversaries. While there are elements of Hope, such as the vision of a 'Golden Age,' these are often overshadowed by unrealistic promises. Dignity and Truth are less prominent, with limited emphasis on individual worth beyond group identity and a lack of engagement with opposing views or evidence-based discourse. Pragmatism is also low, as the speech lacks detailed, feasible plans for the ambitious goals outlined."
