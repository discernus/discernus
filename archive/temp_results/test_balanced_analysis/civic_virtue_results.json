      "raw_response": "Certainly! Let\u2019s analyze the text using the **civic_virtue** framework, which emphasizes the values, responsibilities, and behaviors that support the common good in a democratic society. Civic virtue involves qualities like responsibility, participation, respect for others, and a focus on societal well-being.\n\n**Text:**  \n*\u201cThe future of AI in 2025 will be characterized by more powerful reasoning capabilities, better cost efficiency, and enhanced multimodal features.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n### Civic_Virtue Analysis\n\n**1. Focus on the Common Good:**  \nThe text is primarily descriptive and technological, focusing on advancements in AI capabilities. It does not explicitly address how these improvements will serve the public interest or contribute to societal well-being. A civic virtue perspective would encourage discussion of how these AI advancements could benefit society as a whole (e.g., improving healthcare, education, or public services).\n\n**2. Responsibility and Ethical Considerations:**  \nCivic virtue involves considering the ethical implications and responsibilities that come with technological progress. The text does not mention potential risks, ethical challenges, or the need for responsible stewardship of AI. A civic-minded analysis would highlight the importance of ensuring that more powerful AI is used ethically and equitably.\n\n**3. Participation and Inclusivity:**  \nThe statement does not address who will have access to these AI advancements or how diverse communities might participate in shaping their development and use. Civic virtue would call for inclusivity, ensuring that the benefits of AI are widely shared and that various stakeholders have a voice in its evolution.\n\n**4. Respect and Deliberation:**  \nCivic virtue values respectful dialogue and deliberation about new technologies. The text is neutral and does not engage in debate or acknowledge differing perspectives on AI\u2019s future. A civic virtue approach would encourage open discussion about the societal impacts of AI.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n**Strengths:**  \n- The text is forward-looking and highlights technological progress, which can be a foundation for societal benefit.\n\n**Limitations (from a civic virtue perspective):**  \n- Lacks explicit consideration of the common good, ethical responsibility, inclusivity, and public participation.\n- Does not address how these advancements will be governed or how they might affect democratic values.\n\n**Suggestions for Alignment with Civic Virtue:**  \n- Discuss how AI\u2019s enhanced capabilities can be directed toward public benefit.\n- Address ethical responsibilities and the need for transparent, accountable AI development.\n- Emphasize inclusivity and broad participation in shaping AI\u2019s future.\n- Encourage public dialogue about the societal impacts of AI.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the text highlights important technological trends, a civic virtue analysis reveals the need to connect these advancements to broader societal values and responsibilities, ensuring that AI\u2019s future serves the common good.",
