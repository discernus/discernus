# üéØ Streamlit Chat Interface - Quick Start Guide

## ‚ö° Super Simple Launch

Just run this one command:

```bash
python3 launch_streamlit_chat.py
```

Your browser will automatically open to: **http://localhost:8501**

## üéØ What You Can Do

### 1. **Analyze Political Texts**
Just paste any political speech, article, or text and the AI will analyze it using narrative gravity methodology.

**Example:**
```
Analyze this speech: "We must unite as Americans to build a stronger, more just society where every person has the opportunity to succeed through hard work and determination."
```

### 2. **Switch Frameworks Mid-Chat**
Change analytical frameworks without restarting.

**Examples:**
- "Switch to Civic Virtue framework"
- "Use the Political Spectrum framework" 
- "Change to Fukuyama Identity framework"

### 3. **Create New Frameworks**
Build custom analytical frameworks through conversation (just like how the Fukuyama Identity Framework was created).

**Example:**
```
Create a framework based on John Stuart Mill's concept of liberty
```

### 4. **Large Text Support**
- Paste entire speeches, articles, or documents
- Supports up to 1.2MB of text
- No file upload needed - just copy/paste

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Analysis

### For Framework Creation
- Start with: "Create a framework based on..."
- The AI will guide you through the process step-by-step
- Same method used to create all existing frameworks

### For Comparison
- Analyze one text, then switch frameworks and analyze again
- Ask: "How does this compare to the previous analysis?"

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If the interface won't start:
```bash
# Check if Streamlit is installed
python3 -c "import streamlit; print('OK')"

# If not installed:
pip install streamlit
```

### If you get import errors:
- Make sure you're in the `narrative_gravity_analysis` directory
- Your existing chatbot backend needs to be working

### If analysis seems stuck:
- The AI is actually processing (it can handle large texts)
- Check the "Details" sections for confidence scores
- Try shorter text first to test

2. **No Setup Required** - Just run the launcher
3. **Handles Everything** - From short questions to massive document analysis
