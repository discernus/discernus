# 🚨 STREAMLIT APP DEPRECATION NOTICE

## The Streamlit interface has been superseded by the React Research Workbench

**Effective Date**: January 6, 2025  
**Status**: DEPRECATED - Legacy interface no longer recommended  

---

## 🎯 **NEW RECOMMENDED INTERFACE: React Research Workbench**

The Narrative Gravity Maps project has evolved to use a modern React-based research interface that provides:

### ✨ **Superior Experience**
- **Professional UI**: Modern React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Real-time Debug Monitoring**: Autonomous error detection and terminal logging
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 14 unit tests with continuous validation
- **Research-Focused Design**: Purpose-built for academic analysis workflows

### 🚀 **Launch the New Interface**
```bash
# Start the new React research workbench
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Open in browser
http://localhost:3000
```

### 📋 **New Features Not Available in Streamlit**
- **Autonomous Debug Console**: Real-time error monitoring without manual intervention
- **Terminal Debug Output**: Debug events visible to AI assistants during development
- **Test-Driven Stability**: Comprehensive test harness prevents regressions
- **Modern Architecture**: Future-ready foundation for advanced features

---

## ⚠️ **Streamlit App Status: DEPRECATED**

### **Why Deprecated?**
- **Outdated Architecture**: Single-file monolithic design
- **Limited Debugging**: No autonomous error detection
- **Maintenance Burden**: Duplicated functionality with new React interface
- **User Confusion**: Multiple interfaces creating unclear development path

### **What's Being Removed?**
- `src/narrative_gravity/app.py` (1,388 lines) → **MOVED TO ARCHIVE**
- `launch_streamlit.py` → **MOVED TO ARCHIVE** 
- Streamlit-specific documentation → **MOVED TO ARCHIVE**
- References in main README → **UPDATED TO REACT**

## 🔄 **Migration Guide**

### **For Current Streamlit Users**

#### **Old Workflow (Streamlit)**
```bash
# OLD - No longer recommended
python launch_streamlit.py
# or
streamlit run src/narrative_gravity/app.py
```

#### **New Workflow (React)**
```bash
# NEW - Recommended approach
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## 📁 **Archive Location**

### **Files Moved to Archive**
```
archive/streamlit_legacy/
├── src/narrative_gravity/app.py          # Main Streamlit application
├── launch_streamlit.py                   # Streamlit launcher
├── docs/user-guides/STREAMLIT_APP_STATUS.md
├── docs/examples/STREAMLIT_QUICKSTART.md
└── STREAMLIT_DEPRECATION_NOTICE.md       # This file
```

### **Preserved for Reference**
- **Code Functionality**: All Streamlit features preserved in archive
- **Documentation**: Complete usage guides maintained
- **Test Coverage**: Streamlit tests archived but not deleted
- **Historical Value**: Available for reference during React development

---

## 🛠️ **For Developers**

### **Removing Streamlit Dependencies**
```bash
# After confirming React interface works for your needs:
pip uninstall streamlit plotly-express  # (if not needed elsewhere)
```

### **Code References**
```python
# OLD - Don't use
from src.narrative_gravity.app import main

# NEW - Use React frontend
# Frontend handles UI, backend provides API
```

### **Testing**
```bash
# React interface testing
cd frontend
npm test

# Backend functionality (still valid)
python -m pytest tests/unit/
```
